            <p>
              The Water Information System for Europe (WISE) is a partnership
              between the European Commission and the European Environment
              Agency (EEA).
            </p>
            <p>
              WISE was launched in 2007 providing a web-portal entry to water
              related information ranging from inland waters to marine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years WISE has been improved and updated to respond to
              the user needs and be timely aligned with the European water
              policies requirements.
            </p>
            <p>WISE addresses several user groups.</p>
            <p>
              For users from EU institutions or other environmental national,
              regional and local administrations WISE provides input to thematic
              assessments in the context of EU water related policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              For water professionals and scientists WISE facilitates access to
              reference documents and thematic data, which can be downloaded for
              further analyses.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the general public, including private or public entities, WISE
              illustrates a wide span of water related information through
              interactive maps, charts and indicators.

            <p>
              The personal data collected by the European WISE portal are
              processed in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the
              European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the
              protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
              personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and
              agencies and on the free movement of such data
              <a href="#ftn-1">[1]</a>. Collection and processing of data are
              under the responsibility of the European Environment Agency (EEA),
              NCE2 - Water and Marine Head of Group (NCE - Natural Capital and
              Ecosystems Programme), acting as Data Controller. WISE Data
              processor is the external contractor, in charge of the development
              of the WISE portal.

            <h3>
              2. What personal information we collect and for what purpose
            </h3>
            <p>
              In the context of the WISE portal, we are not collecting and
              publishing personal data. We collect personal information only
              when we create an account in the Eionet User Directory (Eionet
              account) to authorise experts that might directly contribute to
              the WISE web content. Please see the privacy statement of the
              Eionet website<a href="#ftn-1">[2]</a> for details on the Eionet
              User Directory.
            </p>
            <p>
              For generic WISE visitors, as personal data we only process:
              IP-addresses, browser versions and other devices information (i.e.
              transactional data) that are necessary to securely deliver web
              pages to the internet client. These transactional data are also
              processed by the personnel at CERT-EU (<a
                href="https://cert.europa.eu/"
                >https://cert.europa.eu</a
              >) which provides security services for EEA and available to the
              EEA’s Internet Service Provider (tdc.dk) and cloud provider Amazon
              in EU, therefore for them, their privacy policy applies.
            </p>
            <p>
              WISE visitors can request information about WISE, providing
              feedback and reporting bugs by sending an email at:
              <strong
                ><a href="mailto:WISE@eea.europa.eu"
                  >WISE@eea.europa.eu</a
                ></strong
              >; this email is accessible and managed by authorised staff
              composed by the EEA Eionet helpdesk staff and the WISE
              administrators via the EIONET Help Desk system (OTRS). Authorised
              staff can directly reply and solve a request, forward it to the
              EEA or ETC/ICM experts that can also reply, close the ticket of a
              request and prepare the annual anonymised statistics about the
              type of requests. We do not store personal data in cookies. By
              default, the browsing experience of WISE visitors is tracked by
              the EEA Matomo<a href="#ftn-1">[3]</a> software in order to
              produce anonymised statistics. For example, EEA staff may collect
              some data on browsing experience such as masked IP address<a
                href="#ftn-1"
                >[4]</a
              >
              (anonymized by removing the last two bytes), the web pages visited
              by a user, the website page an user were redirected from. The
              statistics aims at improving WISE portal and the browsing
              experience. The analytical reports generated by the EEA Matomo can
              only be accessed through the Eionet Directory authentication
              system by EEA staff, other relevant EU institutions’ staff or by
              duly authorised external contractors, who may be required to
              analyse, develop and/or regularly maintain WISE. By default, EEA
              software Matomo installation respects users’ preferences and do
              not track visitors which have specified "I do not want to be
              tracked" in their web browsers (aka "Do not track").
            </p>
            <h3>3. How long personal data are stored</h3>
            <p>
              Transactional data (security logs) are stored for a maximum of 1
              year for security audit purposes unless there is an individual
              reason to keep information for a longer period of time (e.g. when
              individual IP addresses are blocked if part of a DoS-attack).
            </p>
            <h4>4. How to contact EEA and right to appeal</h4>
            <p>
              WISE users may contact the EEA’s Data Protection Officer (DPO) in
              case of any enquiry relating to the processing of personal data at
              the following email address:
              <a href="mailto:dpo@eea.europa.eu">dpo@eea.europa.eu</a>. WISE
              users are entitled to have recourse at any time to the European

              >; <a href="mailto:edps@edps.europa.eu">edps@edps.europa.eu</a>)
              if they consider that the rights under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725
              have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data
              by the EEA

              mechanism that automatically masks a portion of each visitor's IP
              (Internet Protocol), effectively making it impossible to identify
              a particular website visitor via the sole IP address.
