Moreover, the performance of the shipowner on general CO2 emissions policy (e.g. companywide CO2 emission target) and recycling policy on board of its ships feeds into the CSI. By now, 30  large cargo owners form the clean shipping network have joined the programme. The CSI is calculated based on entered data by the shipowners into the database. Results can be delivered for each vessel and per cargo carrier and allows for a comparison between the shipping fleets (CSI, 2015a, 2015b).","Shipping","not specified","awareness raising",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,"Not specified

It evaluates the environmental performance of ships in regards to air pollutants in a score (in particular for NOX and SOX emissions) and aims to reward ships for improving their environmental performance. A ship’s index value can be improved if the ship is prepared for on shore power supply and if two of the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator data sets are reported. The ESI supports ports and other interested parties to encourage ships to improve their environmental performance. The ESI Score ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 is set for a ship that meets the environmental regulations in force and 100 for a ship that emits no SOX and no NOX and also reports or monitors its energy efficiency. Currently, the best performing ships reach around 60 points. LNG carriers reach up to 80 points (ESI, 2015).
