A ship’s index value can be improved if the ship is prepared for on shore power supply and if two of the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator data sets are reported. The ESI supports ports and other interested parties to encourage ships to improve their environmental performance. The ESI Score ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 is set for a ship that meets the environmental regulations in force and 100 for a ship that emits no SOX and no NOX and also reports or monitors its energy efficiency. Currently, the best performing ships reach around 60 points. LNG carriers reach up to 80 points (ESI, 2015).

Clearways are shipping zones between traffic separation schemes in which mining installations may not be built.

To ensure safe, guaranteed access to the various ports, the access channels are periodically dredged. The Meuse channel was widened during the previous planning period. The Planning Procedures Decree for widening the Eems channel is in preparation. If the quality of dredged material is sufficient, then this material can be distributed in the marine system.

The traffic separation scheme (TSS) and accompanying ‘precautionary areas’ and inshore traffic zones have been established by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)
of the United Nations. The objective of these systems is to regulate traffic so as to prevent vessels colliding.

Policy decisions were defined as: • Activity of national interest.
• Maintaining a system of traffic separation schemes, clearways and anchoring areas
capable of accommodating vessels safely and swiftly.
• Implementing measures to reduce pollution caused by shipping (merchant vessels,
fishing vessels, offshore, supply and recreation).

The designation of areas for shipping takes account of the principle of international law attributing priority to this use; recognised shipping routes that are indispensable for international shipping constitute the framework of the overall planning concept. 

Reservation areas have been designated for shipping.

Shipping industry was involved in public consultation process.

It contains the coordinates concerning the regulations for shipping.

In reservation areas for shipping special consideration is given to shipping interests – a comparative evaluation with other spatially significant planning tasks, measures and projects has to be conducted. In practice reservation areas serve as safety buffers for main shipping routes, thus no activities compromising this function are being eligible within these areas, e.g. fixed constructions such as wind turbines.",not specified,MSPD (Directive 2008/56/EC),"administrative, legislation/regulation",Not specified,National,Germany,Nos specified,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
