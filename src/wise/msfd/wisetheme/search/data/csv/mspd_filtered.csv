The ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend may be extended and a zone surrounding those ports has been created to allow for possible expansion. Designated dredge disposal sites are identified as well as an alternative disposal site to minimize impact on fishing grounds. Shipping and dredging are not allowed in and around wind farms (safety zone of 500 meters)",,,"Safety is extremely important for shipping and therefore the shipping routes must be free of obstacles. The most important criteria are depth and manoeuvrability. If the depth is insufficient the route must be dredged. All potential obstacles also must be removed. Wrecks that constitute obstacles must be buried or moved.","With regard to shipping, the objective is to continue to guarantee safe passage and safe
access to all Belgian ports, not only for the current generation of ships, but also for ships
from the coming generations","International global traffic, Ferry traffic, Short sea shipping, Coastal navigation. Fisheries, Recreational sailing, Tourist transport","Measuring poles and instruments are recognized as important for safe shipping.

Safety objectives: safety of shipping, objectives for protection against the sea and for defence were defined.

Shipping is allowed everywhere in the Belgian sea areas barring different provisions that set up a ban or impose certain conditions.

Shipping International Maritime Organisation traffic separation scheme coordinates were given in the plan. In these areas, other activities may be allowed, insofar these do not structurally make impossible or limit shipping

Areas to be avoided were defined as: a routing system within an established zone in which shipping is extremely dangerous

Precautionary area were defined as: a routeing system within a designated zone where ships must navigate with special precaution and in which a direction for the shipping traffic can be recommended.

Shipping intensities based upon AIS data (for the month of September 2012), with indication of the locations for which intensities are available were used.

There are zones designated for the potential expansion of the ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge Insofar reconcilable with the current port development or a future expansion of the ports concerned, other activities or developments may be allowed.","Not specified","not specified","Not specified","Not specified",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

In addition to commercial vessels, deep-sea towage and hydraulic engineering projects, the North Sea also accommodates fishing vessels and recreational sailing. The economic value of shipping for the Netherlands is high. In addition to the direct and indirect economic
significance of shipping itself, this value also derives from the significance of Dutch ports, of which Rotterdam is one of the largest in the world",,,"Precautionary areas are areas where vessels must take extra care, as multiple traffic separation schemes converge here.","Shipping on the North Sea will remain safe in the future and be sustainable. The challenge is to make this vision a reality whilst faced with an increasing volume and diversity of shipping.",,"Tankers in the Dutch part of the North Sea are obliged to follow the deep-water routes designated by the IMO.

Clearways are shipping zones between traffic separation schemes in which mining installations may not be built.

To ensure safe, guaranteed access to the various ports, the access channels are periodically dredged. The Meuse channel was widened during the previous planning period. The Planning Procedures Decree for widening the Eems channel is in preparation. If the quality of dredged material is sufficient, then this material can be distributed in the marine system.

The traffic separation scheme (TSS) and accompanying ‘precautionary areas’ and inshore traffic zones have been established by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)
of the United Nations. The objective of these systems is to regulate traffic so as to prevent vessels colliding.

Policy decisions were defined as: • Activity of national interest.
• Maintaining a system of traffic separation schemes, clearways and anchoring areas
capable of accommodating vessels safely and swiftly.
• Implementing measures to reduce pollution caused by shipping (merchant vessels,
fishing vessels, offshore, supply and recreation).

In the priority areas for shipping this activity is granted priority over other spatially significant uses and no permission is given to planning, measures and projects not compatible with the shipping priority. 

The designation of areas for shipping takes account of the principle of international law attributing priority to this use; recognised shipping routes that are indispensable for international shipping constitute the framework of the overall planning concept. 

Reservation areas have been designated for shipping.

Shipping industry was involved in public consultation process.

It contains the coordinates concerning the regulations for shipping.

In reservation areas for shipping special consideration is given to shipping interests – a comparative evaluation with other spatially significant planning tasks, measures and projects has to be conducted. In practice reservation areas serve as safety buffers for main shipping routes, thus no activities compromising this function are being eligible within these areas, e.g. fixed constructions such as wind turbines.","Not specified","administrative, legislation/regulation","Not specified","Not specified",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
