BE;ATL;13 and 14;D3;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Aquaculture, a pressure reported by the Member State, is not addressed. Belgium reports that all proposed measures will contribute to achieve GES by 2020.;;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D5;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. PoM covers all pressures reported in Article 8 and all target definitions. However, the measures partially cover the reported activities (no measure on agriculture/forestry) and the GES definition. Belgium reports that all proposed measures will contribute to achieve GES by 2020. This is provided that the relevant measures are assessed as adequate under the WFD. These results are pending the WFD assessment.;;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D7;;No measures are reported specifically for hydrographical changes (D7). Nevertheless, Belgium reports a WFD measure under KTM06 that may address D7 in the coast (where most hydrographical changes occur), although, given the level of detail reported, this cannot be verified.;;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D8;;PoM addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. PoM addresses the pressures and activities reported by Belgium in its Article 8, as well as its GES and targets. Belgium reports that GES will be achieved by 2020.;;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D9;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. The PoM will mainly have indirect effects on the relevant D9 pressure (introduction of hazardous compounds), and is thus not fully addressing all pressures. Furthermore, as none of the measures is D9 specific, it is not clear how they can address the D9 targets. The D8 PoM partially addresses the D9 pressure and several associated activities. Belgium reports GES will be achieved by 2020.;;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D10;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. PoM addresses the reported pressures and activities, GES and targets. Micro-litter is indirectly addressed by the measures. Belgium reports that GES will be achieved by 2020.;;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D11;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. PoM directly addresses underwater noise, by focusing on one of the reported activities (marine-based renewable energy production). The GES definition and one of the targets are also covered. Still, the measures indirectly address shipping (reported in Article 8) through a measure that focuses on communication and awareness raising, and marine research, reported as relevant at the subregional level, is not covered. It is also not clear how the other target is addressed. Belgium reports that GES will be achieved by 2020.;;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Birds;;"PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. The PoM addresses the relevant pressures, including by-catch; however, it is unclear if the measures will be sufficient to achieve a favourable conservation status for birds and targets linked to nesting sites and bird food sources are not covered by the PoM. Nevertheless, Belgium reports that GES will be achieved by 2020.";;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Fish;;"PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. Pressures such as extraction of species by fishing and pollution from ships are addressed; however, targets linked to numbers of thornback rays are not covered by the PoM. Nevertheless, Belgium reports that GES will be achieved by 2020.";;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D1, 4 Mammals;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. By-catch is addressed but pressures from shipping, including underwater noise, are not covered for mammals. Furthermore, general GES components, such as ecosystem structure will not be addressed. Belgium reports that GES will be achieved by 2020.;;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D1, 4 - Water column habitats;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. No measures are reported specifically for water column habitats and no justification is provided. Nevertheless, D2, D5 and D8 measures will contribute to reducing pressures on water column habitats. These are described and assessed in the relevant sections of this report (4.2, 4.4 and 4.6).;;
BE;ATL;13 and 14;D1, 4, 6 – Seabed habitats;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. The PoM addresses physical loss and damage as well as pollution from shipping and selective extraction of gravel. Yet some pressures are not addressed. The PoM also addresses the GES and targets though a variety of spatial protection measures and measures that aim to regulate seabed impacting activities. GES is expected to be achieved by 2020.;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D2;;PoM addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. Pressures, GES and targets are addressed.. However, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D3;;PoM addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. Although the PoM as designed will likely address pressures, GES and targets, uncertainty exists as to whether or not the PoM addresses all commercially-exploited stocks as required by the GES definition. Nevertheless, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D5;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. While the pressure of nutrient enrichment is addressed by the reported PoM, the extent of coverage of agricultural activities is not clear. GES and targets are also partially addressed, as it is not clear how the measures can deliver reduction of nutrient inputs to the marine environment without fully addressing agricultural activities. Furthermore, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage). This is provided also that the relevant measures are assessed as adequate under the WFD. These results are pending the WFD assessment.;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D7;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. The design of the PoM allows for all pressures and targets to be addressed, and GES to be partially addressed. Nevertheless, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D8;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. The PoM partially addresses the pressures and activities reported under Article 8. Industry (as source of accidental pollution) does not appear to be addressed. The measures partially address the GES and targets definitions (the responsibilities for the management of some activities such as the dumping of dredged materials are not clearly defined). Furthermore, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D9;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. The reported measures, combined with the D8 PoM, partially address the pressures and activities reported in Article 8 (industry as a source of accidental pollution is excluded). Moreover, the measures address the GES and targets definitions. Nevertheless, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D10;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. Even though the relevant pressures and activities are addressed, Bulgaria does not provide sufficient detail in its measures to conclude whether GES and targets will be addressed (the measures are likely to partially cover the GES and targets definitions). Furthermore, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D11;;"PoM partially addresses MSFD needs; no GES is defined.. – The reported measures address, either directly or indirectly, the pressures and activities reported under Article 8. Bulgaria has not yet provided GES and target definitions, in light of which, no assessment can be made in this regard or in regard of the timeline. This is a gap in its marine strategy.";;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Birds;;"PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. Pressures, are covered; GES and targets are partially addressed. The PoM can be considered as the ground work for protecting bird species, they are likely not to be enough, as they do not go beyond spatial protection measures. Furthermore, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, as no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).";;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Fish;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. Pressures are covered, however, there is a lack of information about the measures targeting the round goby. Furthermore, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D1, 4 Mammals;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. Pressures, GES and targets are partially covered. Bulgaria reports measures covering by-catch and underwater noise from oil and gas exploitation. Still, no measure covers collisions with ships. No mention of the GES and targets indicator species, (toothed whales) is made. Furthermore, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D1, 4 - Water column habitats;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. Bulgaria does not directly report measures targeting water column habitats. However, the spatial protection and extraction of species measures are likely to contribute to the reduction of pressures for water column habitats. Also, D2, D5 and D8 measures are likely to address some of the GES and targets elements relevant for water column habitats. Nevertheless, Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
BG;BLK;13 and 14;D1, 4, 6 – Seabed habitats;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. The measures partially address pressures, GES and targets. They address ‘physical damage’ caused by fisheries and dredging. Based on the reported information, the PoM does not appear to cover physical loss and damage caused by port operations, land claim and coastal defence. The Member State has subsequently clarified that these would be addressed via WFD measures and the Black Sea Flood Plan, but has not explained how. As such, overall, the PoM is likely to at least partially address MSFD need to progress towards GES. Bulgaria reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved by 2020 (knowledge gaps, no quantitative impact assessment can be made at this stage).;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D2;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures and relevant activities are addressed. Still, shipping (e.g. ballast water management) and land claim/coastal defence (reported by Cyprus in its Article 8) do not appear to be covered. The PoM also addresses Cyprus' GES definition by considering NIS in SEA/EIAs and aiming to develop a marine database to track new introductions. No targets are defined. An exception with a grounded justification is applied: the exception relates to the Suez Canal, which is one of the key points of entry of NIS into the Mediterranean Sea.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D3;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Even though the pressure of extraction of species and most GES components are addressed, it is not clear if all commercial fish species are addressed by Cyprus as the Member State does not specify the covered species and does not clearly link its PoM to the CFP.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D5;;MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Relevant pressures, GES and targets are addressed. Cyprus states that measures will be sufficient to maintain GES. However, no timeline is reported for the implementation of new measures. This is pending the WFD assessment results.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D7;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Even though the GES determination is addressed by the measures, it is not clear whether all relevant activities causing the pressures are covered. Cyprus does not report targets for D7. Furthermore, based on the reported information, it is not clear if GES is expected to be achieved by 2020.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D8;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. PoM addresses the D8-related pressures and reported activities. It also covers the GES and target definitions. GES is reported to be already achieved.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D9;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures, GES and targets are addressed. GES is reported to be already achieved.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D10;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. The D10 PoM includes measures against marine litter from several activities and addresses part of the GES and target definitions (decreasing the overall amount of marine litter). Still, some of the activities reported in Article 8 as responsible for marine litter (shipping and industry) in Cyprus and the other part of the GES and target definitions (on the decrease of the mortality rate of the loggerhead turtles) are not covered. It is not clear if and when GES is expected to be achieved.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D11;;PoM does not address MSFD needs to progress towards GES. PoM addresses the noise pressure by focusing only on one specific activity (hydrocarbon extraction). The other activities reported under Article 8 as responsible for underwater noise are not addressed by the D11 PoM. No GES and targets have been defined by Cyprus for D11. It is not clear if and when GES is expected to be achieved.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Birds;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures, and GES are partially covered by the PoM. Incidental by-catch from fisheries is not covered and apart from one Birds Directive measure no other measure has been reported specifically for birds. It is not clear if and when GES is expected to be achieved.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Fish;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Even though relevant pressures are addressed, GES and targets are only partially addressed as the measures cover mainly fish habitats and not non-commercial fish species. It is not clear if and when GES is expected to be achieved.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D1, 4 Mammals;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures and GES are partially addressed. However, fisheries by-catch is not addressed. It is not clear if and when GES is expected to be achieved.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D1, 4 - Water column habitats;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures, GES and targets are partially covered by general biodiversity measures and measures under other descriptors (D5, D8). However, the member State does nto make the link between these measures and this habitat. It is not clear if and when GES is expected to be achieved.;;
CY;MED;13 and 14;D1, 4, 6 – Seabed habitats;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Even though the measures address fishing and dredging pressures, land claim, coastal defence and port operations are not covered. Therefore, pressures, GES and targets are not fully addressed. It is not clear if and when GES is expected to be achieved.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D2;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. PoM addresses relevant pressures, GES and targets. The Member State reports that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D3;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. The PoM addresses GES, targets as well as the reported pressures. The Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D5;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures, GES and targets are addressed by the reported measures covering agriculture, industrial emissions, urban discharges and shipping. The Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps. These results are pending the WFD assessment.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D7;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Key pressure, GES and target definitions are addressed by measures covering, for example, changes in thermal and salinity regimes, physical damage, physical loss and marine acidification. The Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D8;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures and activities reported in Article 8 are addressed, in addition to GES and targets. The Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D9;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. In combination with the D8 measures, the German PoM addresses the reported pressures, activities, GES and targets. The Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D10;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. The PoM addresses both macro- and micro-litter by targeting relevant human activities in both subregions. As such, pressures, GES and targets are addressed. The Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D11;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. The PoM addresses the reported pressures and activities. They also mostly address GES and targets (no measure to address the EMF related issuesThe Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Member State reports a D11 PoM with several good practices, such as the coverage of light disturbance and setting a legal noise limit.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Birds;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. The PoM addresses the relevant pressures, including by-catch, but also visual disturbance and habitat loss.

DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D1, 4 Mammals;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. The PoM addresses significant pressures for mammals, such as by-catch caused by fisheries and underwater noise from various human activities. GES and targets are also addressed. The Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D1, 4 - Water column habitats;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Even though the Member State does not report measures that specifically address water column habitats, measures reported for seabed habitats and species groups will partially address water column habitat pressures and GES. Furthermore, measures from other descriptors (D2, D5, D8) are likely going to support the achievement of GES for these habitats, however, Germany does not explain how this will be done. The Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps.;;
DE ;ATL ;13 and 14;D1, 4, 6 – Seabed habitats;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures, GES and targets are partially addressed. The PoM addresses activities that cause physical damage and loss, in particular from fishing activities. The Member State comments that it cannot estimate if GES will be achieved or not by 2020, given knowledge gaps.;;
DK;BAL ;13 and 14;D2;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. The measures focus on NIS ship-borne transport (including yachting) and transport via fisheries and aquaculture activities, which enables GES and targets definitions to be addressed. However, biofouling is only indirectly covered through monitoring efforts. The measures will prevent the introduction of new NIS and monitoring actions are in place regarding existing ones. The PoM aims to achieve GES by 2020;;
DK;BAL ;13 and 14;D3;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures, all relevant activities, as well as GES and targets are addressed by the PoM, through the implementation of the CFP. The PoM aims to achieve GES by 2020;;
DK;BAL ;13 and 14;D5;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures, GES and most of the targets are addressed by Denmark’s measures. However, no measure has been reported to directly address two of the targets. GES is not expected to be achieved by 2020 in the Baltic Sea and an exception with a grounded justification has been provided. This is provided that the relevant measures are assessed as adequate under the WFD. These results are pending the WFD assessment;;
DK;BAL ;13 and 14;D7;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Pressures are addressed, yet it should be noted that cumulative impacts are not clearly considered. The GES definition is addressed by the PoM and no targets have been defined for D7 (but the definition of GES is used as an intermediate environmental target). Denmark reports that GES is expected to be achieved by 2020 in all regions;;
DK;BAL ;13 and 14;D8;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. All relevant pressures and activities, as well as the GES and targets definitions, are addressed by the measures. The PoM aims to achieve GES by 2020;;

DK;BAL ;13 and 14;D10;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. Even though the measures address the relevant pressures, activities and targets, NIS-related aspects and the socioeconomic impacts of marine litter are not specifically covered, despite being included in the GES definition, which is therefore only partially addressed. The PoM aims to achieve GES by 2020;;
DK;BAL ;13 and 14;D11;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress towards GES. All activities reported in Article 8 are covered (even though the dumping of munitions has been mentioned in Article 8, Denmark ensures that it does not dump munitions and measures have been reported to cover military activities). The PoM also addresses other sources of underwater noise (such as shipping for example). GES and targets are addressed. The PoM aims to achieve GES by 2020;;
DK;BAL ;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Birds;;PoM partially addresses MSFD need to progress towards GES. Pressures, GES and targets are only partially addressed. The PoM aims to achieve GES by 2020;;

EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D2;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress toward GES. Even though the measures do not seem to cover biofouling and the long-term impact of NIS, shipping (ballast water) is covered. Estonia reports that GES should be achieved by 2020.;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D3;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress toward GES. The extraction of fish due to commercial fisheries, as well as GES and all targets are addressed by the measures. However, the extraction of seaweed does not seem to be addressed and it is not clear whether recreational fishing is fully covered by the measures. Estonia reports that GES will be achieved by 2020;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D5;;PoM addresses MSFD needs to progress toward GES. The PoM addresses the relevant pressures and reported activities as well as the GES and targets definitions, and the justification of the applied exception is grounded. GES is not likely to be achieved by 2020. This is provided that the relevant measures are assessed as adequate under the WFD. These results are pending the WFD assessment.;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D7;;No conclusion – Even though at least one of the activities reported under Article 8 is addressed, it is not clear whether all relevant activities and targets are covered due to uncertainties about the objectives of the measures. GES has not been defined for D7.;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D8 and D9;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress toward GES for D8 and addresses them for D9. Although the PoM addresses the relevant pressures and reported activities as well as GES and targets for D9 and the GES definition for D8, the D8-related targets defined are only partially covered because of uncertainties regarding how the measures can avoid negative biological impacts or physiological disturbances of contaminants. While for D9, GES is expected to be achieved by 2020, it will not be the case for D8. An exception with a grounded justification has been provided.;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D10;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress toward GES. Even though the measures fully address the reported pressures and activities, GES has not been defined yet for D10 and it is not clear to which extent the measures (especially the new ones) will contribute to a reduction of a particular type of litter, as defined in the targets (micro-litter is not addressed for example).;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D11;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress toward GES. Even if GES has not been defined by Estonia and it is not clear whether all elements of the targets definitions are covered, the measures (existing and new) address the pressures and activities as well as some environmental targets.;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Birds;;PoM does not address MSFD needs to progress toward GES. Pressures, GES and targets definition are not addressed since only spatial protection measures are reported and no link to birds can be done in the measures. Estonia reports that GES is expected to be achieved by 2020.;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D1, 4 – Fish;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress toward GES. The measures do not clearly address the extraction of species, nor refer to one of the species used as indicators for the achievement of GES and targets (smolt salmon). Estonia reports that GES is expected to be achieved by 2020.;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D1, 4 Mammals;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress toward GES. Pressures are partially addressed as the measures focus on spatial protection and species-specific management plans (but no specific human activity nor pressures). Still, the GES and targets definitions are addressed because the measures specifically cover the two species mentioned in these definitions. GES is not expected to be achieved by 2020 and an exception with a grounded justification has been provided.;;
EE;BAL ;13 and 14;D1, 4 - Water column habitats;;PoM partially addresses MSFD needs to progress toward GES. The measures focus on aquaculture and oil spills. Other activities and potential pressures are not covered. Estonia reports that GES is expected to be achieved by 2020;;

EL ;MED ;13 and 14;D1, 4 - Water column habitats;;PoM does not address MSFD needs to progress toward GES. Pressures related to water column habitats will be only indirectly addressed, and the spatial scope of spatial protection measures is limited to MPAs. Planktonic communities will therefore only be protected from pressures from some sea-based activities.;;
