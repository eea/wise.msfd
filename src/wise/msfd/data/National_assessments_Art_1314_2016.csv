BE;ATL;13;D1-B;Coverage of pressures;"Belgium’s PoM addresses the pressures of selective extraction of species, including accidental by-catch of birds through the reported measures, covering a ban on gill nets and tangling nets (measure 11), and other fisheries management measures (23A). The pressure of pollution generated by dangerous substances will be addressed by two measures (23A, 26A), one of which aims to reduce pollution originating from shipping and oil pollution, in particular (26A). Furthermore, light and noise pollution from high speed air traffic and marine sport competitions will be regulated in SPAs. 

At a regional level, Belgium links measures 23A and 26A to actions undertaken in the context of OSPAR for D1, 4 Birds.";The reported groups of measures address the main pressures, i.e. by-catch, injuries caused by fishing activities, contamination from oil, and chemical spills originating from shipping and fishing vessels. ;3;Addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b800d03d-1dbf-40a1-8e68-712ab87453ed/details
BE;ATL;13;D1-B;Coverage of GES and targets;"Belgium has not defined species-specific GES but, rather, a general overarching GES, which addresses most species groups. The Belgian GES refers to species distribution, population size, population condition, habitat distribution, habitat extent, habitat condition and ecosystem structure, which can be applicable to birds, in addition to conditions of benthic community, which represents some of the bird food sources and is therefore linked to birds. The Belgian determination of GES states that all bird species protected under the Birds Directive shall achieve FCS under the Birds Directive. Even though Belgium addresses some of the pressures on seabirds through its measures, it is unclear if the measures will sufficiently support the achievement of FCS for the relevant species and address aspects such as population size, species distribution, habitat conditions, etc. Nor are the measures likely to address the general GES criteria of ecosystem structure, linked to D4 Food webs. Belgium specifies one group of bird species within the context of by-catch reduction, the Grebes (order Podicipedidae), with the common murre (Uria aalge) mentioned in relation to reducing oil pollution for birds. No other species have been specified. Also, it is unclear how the Belgian PoM intends to achieve diversity within bird species. The PoM thus can partially support the achievement of GES.

Belgium’s bird targets relate to seabird breeding abundance (target 1), mean species density of non-scavenging species (target 2), mean species density of scavenging species (target 3) and the mean species density for scavenging species as defined by the Birds Directive (targets 4 and 17). The reported PoM is likely to partially address these by aiming to reduce bird deaths and injuries through by-catch and pollution from ships. However, other human factors impacting on the population size of birds are not addressed, such as damage and disturbance to nesting sites and the impairment of suitable food sources. Despite Belgium’s defined targets for specific bird species, these are not specifically mentioned in the PoM. As explained for GES, the common murre (Uria aalge) and birds of the genus Grebes (order Podicipedidae) are mentioned in relation to reducing oil pollution for birds. Therefore, it is not possible to assess if the species defined by the targets are addressed by the measures, making them partially capable of addressing bird targets.  ";"It is unclear if the measures will sufficiently support the achievement of FCS for the relevant species and address their diverse relevant aspects, including population size, species distribution and habitat conditions. The GES criteria linked to D4 Food webs with respect to ecosystem structure will likely not be addressed by the measures. The relevant targets are partially addressed, as the PoM will support the reduction of deaths and impairments through by-catch and sea-based pollution; however, the PoM does not address damage or disturbances to nesting sites and impairment of suitable bird food sources. It might not, therefore, address the population size of birds.

BE;ATL;13;D1-F;Coverage of pressures;"Several of Belgium’s measures aim to address the impacts of fisheries extraction, such as selective species extraction, by-catch and discards (measures 8, 23, 26A).

BE;ATL;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"A large number of measures address physical impacts to the seabed, which include the pressures of physical loss and physical disturbance, including abrasion. Belgium considers fishing activities to be a contributing activity to these pressures and therefore reported a number of measures that aim to reduce the impacts of fishing gear on the seabed (measure 6E, 9, 26B, 26C, 23A), even if some of the measures are trial cases and the corresponding monitoring activities (thus, indirect measures). 

Belgium also identified offshore constructions as an activity which can cause physical loss and damage, in particular occurring during constructions for offshore wind farms. These activities will be addressed by measures 3A, 3F and 7C. A large number of Belgium’s measures address activities linked to sand and gravel extraction, which it considers having significant physical impacts on the seabed (measure 4A-E, 6B, 6C, 25A, 25B). Finally, physical impacts on the seabed also stem from the dumping of dredge material, which is addressed by measures 5A, 6D and 7D. Belgium reports that the pressure of selective extraction of gravel originating from fishing activities is addressed by two measures (25A and 25B). Belgium also considers the pressure of severe pollution from shipping to be relevant for seabed habitats and it seeks to address this through measure 26A. Belgium also reports submarine cables and pipeline operations as a relevant source of pressure and addresses it with measures 3C and 6A. Nevertheless, land claim activities are not addressed. Furthermore, sand extraction is allowed in protected habitats and be reduced by 1% per year.

At subregional level, Belgium - like most North Sea Member States – reports under Article 8 that marine renewable energy generation, land claim and coastal defence, and solid waste disposal are relevant for physical loss in its waters. While the Belgian PoM addresses marine renewable energy generation and solid waste disposal, land claim and coastal defence activities have not been addressed by Belgium’s measures. It is unclear, therefore, whether or not the physical loss pressure is addressed by the PoM. On the other hand, Belgium reports that physical damage, fisheries, shipping and marine mining will be relevant for physical damage in its waters, which are all addressed by the PoM. 

Again, Belgium links measures 5, 23A and 26A for seabed habitats to OSPAR.";"Water column habitats: No measures are reported specifically for water column habitats and no justification is provided. Nevertheless, D2, D5 and D8 measures will contribute to reducing pressures on water column habitats. These are described and assessed in the relevant sections of this report (4.2, 4.4 and 4.6, as well as 4.10.7).

Seabed habitats: The reported groups of measures partially address physical loss and damage pressures from fishing activities, offshore constructions, the laying of underwater cables, sand and gravel extractions and the dumping of dredge material. Severe pollution from shipping will also be covered, in addition to selective extraction of gravel through fishing activities. Land claim activities are not addressed. Furthermore, sand extraction is allowed in protected habitats and will be reduced by 1% per year.

BE;ATL;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"The Belgian PoM addresses the GES definition as the reported measures aim to reduce impacts from human activities (such as fishing, sand and gravel extraction, construction, etc.), which will likely lead to the improvement and maintenance of seafloor integrity, reduce physical damage and improve the condition of benthic communities. 

Target 7 is likely to be addressed through the PoM, as Belgium reports several measures that aim to restore gravel and sand beds by managing, limiting and even banning extraction activities in some areas. Targets 8 and 9 are also addressed, as an important section of Belgium’s measures will work towards reducing the impact of fishing gear on seabed habitats. Target 10 is likely to be addressed through measures covering further designations and implementations of MPAs, with destructive fishing activities and other seabed-harming activities limited or banned in some trial areas. 

As the measures will cover MPA designations, limits and bans on gravel bed exploitation and fishing activities, and collaboration between the Flemish and federal authorities, they will likely address the objectives defined by the targets, i.e. a positive trend in key engineering benthic species (target 11), the spring median benthic bioturbation potential of the white furrow shell (Abra alba) (target 12), a positive trend in median size of the sessile, long-lived and larger benthic species (target 13), a positive trend in frequency of occurrence and density of key and long-lived species (target 14), prevention of loss or positive trend in species richness within all key hard substrate taxa (target 15) and a decrease of occurrence frequency of damaged common starfish (Asterias rubens). Even though Belgium does not specify the species covered in its measure descriptions, it reports which targets - and therefore which species - will be addressed by each individual measure. It is likely, therefore, that the relevant species are targeted by the PoM, thus addressing the targets for seabed habitats.";"Water column habitats: No measures are reported specifically for water column habitats and no justification is provided.

Seabed habitats: The reported measures aim to reduce the impacts from human activities, including fisheries and sand and gravel extraction. This addresses the GES criteria for seafloor integrity, physical damage and benthic communities.

BE;ATL;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment  
A large number of measures address physical impacts to the seabed, which include the pressures of physical loss and physical disturbance, including abrasion. Belgium considers fishing activities to be a contributing activity to these pressures and therefore reported a number of measures that aim to reduce the impacts of fishing gear on the seabed (measure 6E, 9, 26B, 26C, 23A), even if some of the measures are trial cases and the corresponding monitoring activities (thus, indirect measures). 

Belgium also identified offshore constructions as an activity which can cause physical loss and damage, in particular occurring during constructions for offshore wind farms. These activities will be addressed by measures 3A, 3F and 7C. A large number of Belgium’s measures address activities linked to sand and gravel extraction, which it considers having significant physical impacts on the seabed (measure 4A-E, 6B, 6C, 25A, 25B). Finally, physical impacts on the seabed also stem from the dumping of dredge material, which is addressed by measures 5A, 6D and 7D. Belgium reports that the pressure of selective extraction of gravel originating from fishing activities is addressed by two measures (25A and 25B). Belgium also considers the pressure of severe pollution from shipping to be relevant for seabed habitats and it seeks to address this through measure 26A. Belgium also reports submarine cables and pipeline operations as a relevant source of pressure and addresses it with measures 3C and 6A. Nevertheless, land claim activities are not addressed. Furthermore, sand extraction is allowed in protected habitats and be reduced by 1% per year.

At subregional level, Belgium - like most North Sea Member States – reports under Article 8 that marine renewable energy generation, land claim and coastal defence, and solid waste disposal are relevant for physical loss in its waters. While the Belgian PoM addresses marine renewable energy generation and solid waste disposal, land claim and coastal defence activities have not been addressed by Belgium’s measures. It is unclear, therefore, whether or not the physical loss pressure is addressed by the PoM. On the other hand, Belgium reports that physical damage, fisheries, shipping and marine mining will be relevant for physical damage in its waters, which are all addressed by the PoM. 

Again, Belgium links measures 5, 23A and 26A for seabed habitats to OSPAR.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment

Nevertheless, D2, D5 and D8 measures will contribute to reducing pressures on water column habitats. These are described and assessed in the relevant sections of this report (4.2, 4.4 and 4.6, as well as 4.10.7).

Seabed habitats: The reported groups of measures partially address physical loss and damage pressures from fishing activities, offshore constructions, the laying of underwater cables, sand and gravel extractions and the dumping of dredge material. Severe pollution from shipping will also be covered, in addition to selective extraction of gravel through fishing activities. Land claim activities are not addressed.

BE;ATL;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessement 
The Belgian PoM addresses the GES definition as the reported measures aim to reduce impacts from human activities (such as fishing, sand and gravel extraction, construction, etc.), which will likely lead to the improvement and maintenance of seafloor integrity, reduce physical damage and improve the condition of benthic communities. 

Target 7 is likely to be addressed through the PoM, as Belgium reports several measures that aim to restore gravel and sand beds by managing, limiting and even banning extraction activities in some areas. Targets 8 and 9 are also addressed, as an important section of Belgium’s measures will work towards reducing the impact of fishing gear on seabed habitats. Target 10 is likely to be addressed through measures covering further designations and implementations of MPAs, with destructive fishing activities and other seabed-harming activities limited or banned in some trial areas. 

As the measures will cover MPA designations, limits and bans on gravel bed exploitation and fishing activities, and collaboration between the Flemish and federal authorities, they will likely address the objectives defined by the targets, i.e. a positive trend in key engineering benthic species (target 11), the spring median benthic bioturbation potential of the white furrow shell (Abra alba) (target 12), a positive trend in median size of the sessile, long-lived and larger benthic species (target 13), a positive trend in frequency of occurrence and density of key and long-lived species (target 14), prevention of loss or positive trend in species richness within all key hard substrate taxa (target 15) and a decrease of occurrence frequency of damaged common starfish (Asterias rubens). Even though Belgium does not specify the species covered in its measure descriptions, it reports which targets - and therefore which species - will be addressed by each individual measure. It is likely, therefore, that the relevant species are targeted by the PoM, thus addressing the targets for seabed habitats.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment

Under measure BLKBG-M014-TRB, Bulgaria specifically highlights its intention to consider bird conservation when updating management plans for MPAs.  

Bulgaria reports a number of fisheries measures which may address bird by-catch. Furthermore, it addresses by-catch from fisheries through one bird specific measure (BLKBG-M013-TRB) and particularly in MPAs (BLKBG-M014-TRB, BLKBG-M015-TRB). Overall, the PoM addresses the pressures.

BG ;BLK ;13;D1-B;Coverage of GES and targets;"The GES definition for birds focuses on ensuring stable or increasing populations of bird species by considering species composition, distribution, demography, health and habitats, including foraging and resting sites of birds. GES aims to reduce significant fluctuations in these characteristics in the medium and long term. Specific species used as indicators are the Yelkouan shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan) and the European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis). The measures appear to develop the ground work for protecting bird species, as they cover spatial protection measures and include awareness raising campaigns and research. In addition, Bulgaria reports one measure which specifically covers the protection of the two species defined in the GES. However, it is unlikely that these initial actions will achieve stable populations of the indicator species and other seabirds by 2020, as follow-up actions are likely to be necessary. The measures thus partially cover GES. 

The targets focus on species distribution, population size and abundance of key trophic groups within specific bird populations. The Yelkouan shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan) and the European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) populations have been defined as indicator species. As for the GES assessment, while the reported measures represent steps towards achieving the targets, they are not sufficient to achieve the targets by 2020.

BG ;BLK ;13;D1-F;Coverage of pressures;"The measures address the impact of human activities on fish habitats in spatial protection and MPA measures (BLKBG-M014-TRB, BLKBG-M015-TRB). Furthermore, Bulgaria comprehensively covers the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by recreational fishing (BLKBG-M029-E) and commercial fishing (BLKBG-M027-E, BLKBG-M028-E, BLKBG-M031-E, BLKBG-M033-E, BLKBG-M034-E, BLKBG-M007-TRB, BLKBG-M011-TRB). The fisheries measures cover the different fishing techniques, including trawl fishing, and also focus on using more selective and less destructive fishing methods. Furthermore, Bulgaria aims to regulate fishing activities through fishing bans for specific species and in specific areas. In addition, Bulgaria addresses underwater noise impacts originating from oil and gas exploitation activities on fish (BLKBG-M020-N). The Member State clarified that most planned measures are directly or indirectly related to the conservation of non-commercial fish species. The measures relate to the implementation of eco-friendly fishing techniques and equipment that will directly or indirectly contribute to the conservation of non-commercial species:  by reducing by-catch (measures BLKBG-M007-TRB, BLKBG-M011-TRB) or protecting of the habitats, especially breeding sites (measure BLKBG-M009-TRB, BLKBG-M019-N). Thus, the measures aim to protect both commercial and non-commercial fish species in the Bulgarian part of Black sea (coastal, territorial waters and EEZ). Therefore, pressures on fish species are addressed by Bulgaria’s PoM.

At a regional level, the D3 PoM has been planned and coordinated with Romania, as what was initially decided in the scope of the EU project (phase 2), therefore Bulgaria is also addressing regionally relevant pressures.

There is also an emphasis on avoiding feedback loops within the trophic levels of the food web. While Bulgaria’s biodiversity PoM primarily focuses on fish, most measures link to D3 and cover mostly commercial fish species, the Member State reports that its measures also address non-commercial fish species. Therefore, the measures address GES. 

Fish targets focus on the distribution and abundance of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and other demersal fish species by ensuring that they are not affected by human activities. Specific limits are defined for non-commercial fish species, including total number of species, various thresholds (i.e. Shannon index, alpha diversity, Gini Simpson and taxonomic distinctiveness). Furthermore, the targets demand a reduction in by-catch mortality.

There is limited reference to these three species in the measures, generally to do with changes in certain fishing equipment, the updating of management plans and public awareness raising activities. More information on specific measures relating to these three species would be necessary in order to make an assessment of its effects. Even though impacts from by-catch and underwater noise from oil and gas exploitation are addressed by the PoM, collision impacts on marine mammals are not mentioned. The PoM therefore partially addresses GES. 

Targets for mammals relate to the population trends and distribution range of the three species of toothed whale: the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), the common bottlenose dolphin (Turciops truncates) and the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis). The targets aim to reduce by-catch, develop MPAs and undertake scientific research.

BG ;BLK ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Measures covering spatial protection measures and the extraction of species may positively contribute to water column habitats. In addition, measures reported under D2, D5 and D8 might also contribute to reducing relevant pressures. Nevertheless, Bulgaria did not make the link between these measures and water column habitats. Therefore, impacts of measures of other descriptors will be further discussed in the section ‘Assessment of the impact of measures reported under pressure descriptors on D1, 4, 6 Biodiversity’. Overall, pressures for water column habitats are partially addressed by the PoM. 

At a regional level, Bulgaria reports a number of measures which are conducted in collaboration with Romania. 

In its Article 8 reporting Bulgaria identified the pressure ‘physical loss’ as relevant for its waters, caused by activities such as port operations and land claim and coastal defence. However, Bulgaria’s PoM does not include measures that address this pressure or these activities directly. In addition, it identified physical damage as a relevant pressure caused by fisheries, port operations and land claim and coastal defence. Bulgaria’s PoM addresses the activity commercial and recreational fisheries, as a cause of physical damage. A number of Bulgaria’s measures focus on monitoring and research measures that aim to determine the impact of fishing activities on seabed habitats. The Member State reports that, based on these measures, fishing restrictions and bans will be developed in the future. However, for now these activities will have mainly indirect effects. Again, port operations, land claim and coastal defence are not covered by the measures. 

At the regional level, Romania did not identify physical loss as relevant, although it did acknowledge that activities such as dredging, shipping and land claim and coastal defence were causing physical damage in its waters. Bulgaria addresses these activities partly. It addresses dredging and dumping of dredge materials through one measure, which focuses on monitoring and research, but also revising and drafting new legislation to reduce pressures from these activities (Measure BLKBG-M020-N). The PoM currently partially addresses the pressures. 

Again, measures reported by Bulgaria are developed in collaboration with Romania.

";"Water column habitats: Even though no water column-specific measures are reported, measures linked to spatial protection and extraction of species, in addition to pollution and marine litter are likely to contribute to the reduction of pressures for water column habitats. Therefore, pressures are partially covered.

Seabed habitats: The measures partially address the pressures reported under Article 8, as Bulgaria covers the pressure ‘physical damage’ caused by fisheries and dredging.

BG ;BLK ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"The GES definition focusses on the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton, stating that the physical, chemical and hydrographic conditions of the water column need to be suitable for long-term maintenance of these populations. While Bulgaria does not refer to plankton communities in its PoM, it is possible that the reported measures will contribute to some of these GES aspects. However, given the limited number of measures and the lack of detail provided, the PoM is likely to partially address the GES. 

Bulgaria states that the relevant pressure targets for water column habitats are defined for D2, D5 and D8. The measures of these descriptors are therefore more relevant for addressing these aspects. In its targets Bulgaria defines biomass for phytoplankton and zooplankton, in particular for spring and autumn blooms. As Bulgaria reports general measures and does not refer to phytoplankton or zooplankton in its measures, the extent to which these targets are addressed by the reported measures is unclear, thus the PoM partially addresses targets.  

The GES definition for seabed habitats focuses on the distribution, extent and condition of the predominant seabed habitat types, along with the diversity of species and associated communities that all occur within natural and environmental limits. The definition also includes consideration for long-term maintenance of typical biological communities, ensuring ecological functioning, securing ecosystem goods and minimising the negative impacts of human activities. Bulgaria does not report specific seabed habitat measures, and most measures reported are primarily fisheries measures. Bulgaria clarified that fisheries, especially trawling, is considered as the most significant pressure impacting seabed habitats. It is likely that these measures will contribute to a reduction of fishing pressures on seabed habitats. Furthermore, dredging and dumping of dredge material is covered through one measure. However, o relevant activities, such as port operations, land claim and coastal defence, which Bulgaria had identified under Article 8 as causing physical loss and damage, are not covered by the PoM. The Member State has clarified that port operations are addressed through the WFD (even though no measures are reported under the MSFD) and that land claim and coastal defence are addressed through the Black Sea Flood Plan (even though no measures are reported under the MSFD). Based on the information reported, it may be that these activities are covered, but how these are addressed is not explained. Therefore, the measures partially address GES. 

The seabed habitat targets are extensive and detailed, primarily focusing on the distribution, abundance, condition, and range, presence of sensitive species, and multi-metric indices of zoobenthos and phytobenthos. There are additional targets relating to the extraction of living resources and non-living resources, and the permanent loss of biogenic substrate. Considering these detailed targets, it is unlikely that all of the defined species and aspects will be covered by the general, mostly fisheries-focused measure and one measure addressing dredging. The PoM therefore partially addresses the targets for seabed habitats.";"Water column habitats: GES and targets specifically link to plankton communities and their biomass, and Bulgaria reports few measures that are likely to also concern these species. However, considering the limited number of measures and the lack of detail provided, this cannot be ensured.

BG ;BLK ;13;D4;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
The measures address the impact of human activities on fish habitats in spatial protection and MPA measures (BLKBG-M014-TRB, BLKBG-M015-TRB). Furthermore, Bulgaria comprehensively covers the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by recreational fishing (BLKBG-M029-E) and commercial fishing (BLKBG-M027-E, BLKBG-M028-E, BLKBG-M031-E, BLKBG-M033-E, BLKBG-M034-E, BLKBG-M007-TRB, BLKBG-M011-TRB). The fisheries measures cover the different fishing techniques, including trawl fishing, and also focus on using more selective and less destructive fishing methods. Furthermore, Bulgaria aims to regulate fishing activities through fishing bans for specific species and in specific areas. In addition, Bulgaria addresses underwater noise impacts originating from oil and gas exploitation activities on fish (BLKBG-M020-N). The Member State clarified that most planned measures are directly or indirectly related to the conservation of non-commercial fish species. The measures relate to the implementation of eco-friendly fishing techniques and equipment that will directly or indirectly contribute to the conservation of non-commercial species:  by reducing by-catch (measures BLKBG-M007-TRB, BLKBG-M011-TRB) or protecting of the habitats, especially breeding sites (measure BLKBG-M009-TRB, BLKBG-M019-N). Thus, the measures aim to protect both commercial and non-commercial fish species in the Bulgarian part of Black sea (coastal, territorial waters and EEZ). Therefore, pressures on fish species are addressed by Bulgaria’s PoM.

At a regional level, the D3 PoM has been planned and coordinated with Romania, as what was initially decided in the scope of the EU project (phase 2), therefore Bulgaria is also addressing regionally relevant pressures. 

Bulgaria addresses impacts on mammal habitats through spatial protection measures, which aim to extend and improve management in Bulgaria’s MPA network (BLKBG-M014-TRB, BLKBG-M015-TRB, BLKBG-M020-N). By-catch for marine mammals is specifically mentioned in three new measures covering the development of more selective fishing methods (BLKBG-M0011-TRB), management plans for protected areas and areas (BLKBG-M014-TRB) and MPAs in Bulgaria and Romania (BLKBG-M015-TRB). In addition, Bulgaria addresses underwater noise impacts on marine mammals during oil and gas exploitation activities (BLKBG-M020-N). Nevertheless, pressures such as underwater noise caused by shipping and mammals collisions with boats, have not directly been addressed by measures reported for- mammals. Also, the bioaccumulation of contaminants in marine mammals does not seem addressed by any measure that Bulgaria reports in its PoM. The pressures are thus partially addressed.

At a regional level, Bulgaria coordinates a number of its measures with Romania.

BG ;BLK ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
The GES definitions specifically consider non-commercial fish species, with an emphasis on the stable or increasing distribution of species, in addition to population size, relative abundance, demography, biomass of key trophic groups and habitat condition. There is also an emphasis on avoiding feedback loops within the trophic levels of the food web. While Bulgaria’s biodiversity PoM primarily focuses on fish, most measures link to D3 and cover mostly commercial fish species, the Member State reports that its measures also address non-commercial fish species. Therefore, the measures address GES. 

Fish targets focus on the distribution and abundance of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and other demersal fish species by ensuring that they are not affected by human activities. Specific limits are defined for non-commercial fish species, including total number of species, various thresholds (i.e. Shannon index, alpha diversity, Gini Simpson and taxonomic distinctiveness). Furthermore, the targets demand a reduction in by-catch mortality. In addition, Bulgaria defined in its targets that it aims to create and expand its MPA network, to develop MPA management plans and support increased scientific research within these areas. From the information provided in the PoM, it is indicated that targets linked to by-catch, MPAs, and research are addressed. It is not clear whether the measures will cover the round goby, as the species is not mentioned in the measures. 

The GES definition focuses on ensuring that the three species of toothed whale which occur along Bulgaria’s coast are found in stable or increasing numbers across its waters, with minimal deaths caused by human activities, including fisheries and shipping. While Bulgaria does not specify these species in the GES, they are included in the targets and it may be assumed that the same species are covered by the GES and targets (Phocoena phocoena, Turciops truncatus, Delphinus delphis). There is limited reference to these three species in the measures, generally to do with changes in certain fishing equipment, the updating of management plans and public awareness raising activities. More information on specific measures relating to these three species would be necessary in order to make an assessment of its effects. Even though impacts from by-catch and underwater noise from oil and gas exploitation are addressed by the PoM, collision impacts on marine mammals are not mentioned. The PoM therefore partially addresses GES. 

Targets for mammals relate to the population trends and distribution range of the three species of toothed whale: the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), the common bottlenose dolphin (Turciops truncates) and the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis). The targets aim to reduce by-catch, develop MPAs and undertake scientific research. Again, these species are solely linked to an underwater noise measure in the PoM, but are not mentioned in respect of by-catch or spatial protection measures, and it is not clear whether the reported measures will address all of these species and aspects. The PoM therefore partially addresses the targets. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
GES and targets are partially addressed. Aspects such as by-catch, MPAs, and research are addressed for commercial and non-commercial species. However, little information is provided in the measures to allow an assessment whether they will cover a target specified species, the round goby. 

GES and targets are partially addressed, as even though Bulgaria covers by-catch and underwater noise from oil and gas exploitation, it does not cover pressures from shipping, which will hinder the achievement of GES. Furthermore, the Member State does not refer to the GES and target indicator species, toothed whale, in its PoM, which makes it difficult to assess whether all relevant species are covered by the measures.

BG ;BLK ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Measures covering spatial protection measures and the extraction of species may positively contribute to water column habitats. In addition, measures reported under D2, D5 and D8 might also contribute to reducing relevant pressures. Nevertheless, Bulgaria did not make the link between these measures and water column habitats. Therefore, impacts of measures of other descriptors will be further discussed in the section ‘Assessment of the impact of measures reported under pressure descriptors on D1, 4, 6 Biodiversity’. Overall, pressures for water column habitats are partially addressed by the PoM. 

At a regional level, Bulgaria reports a number of measures which are conducted in collaboration with Romania. 

In its Article 8 reporting Bulgaria identified the pressure ‘physical loss’ as relevant for its waters, caused by activities such as port operations and land claim and coastal defence. However, Bulgaria’s PoM does not include measures that address this pressure or these activities directly. In addition, it identified physical damage as a relevant pressure caused by fisheries, port operations and land claim and coastal defence. Bulgaria’s PoM addresses the activity commercial and recreational fisheries, as a cause of physical damage. A number of Bulgaria’s measures focus on monitoring and research measures that aim to determine the impact of fishing activities on seabed habitats. The Member State reports that, based on these measures, fishing restrictions and bans will be developed in the future. However, for now these activities will have mainly indirect effects. Again, port operations, land claim and coastal defence are not covered by the measures. 

At the regional level, Romania did not identify physical loss as relevant, although it did acknowledge that activities such as dredging, shipping and land claim and coastal defence were causing physical damage in its waters. Bulgaria addresses these activities partly. It addresses dredging and dumping of dredge materials through one measure, which focuses on monitoring and research, but also revising and drafting new legislation to reduce pressures from these activities (Measure BLKBG-M020-N). The PoM currently partially addresses the pressures. 

Again, measures reported by Bulgaria are developed in collaboration with Romania.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment

CY ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Although Cyprus reports no specific biodiversity measures addressing water column habitats, the general measures for all species groups address this habitat. For example, spatial protection measures, MPA designation and management measures will have an impact on water column habitats and contribute to the improvement of their status (measures 1, 6, 7, 10, 14). Furthermore, measures reported in other descriptors such as D2, D5, D8 and D10 are likely to also contribute to addressing pressures on water column habitats. These potential links are described in section 4.11.8 of this report. 

Cyprus addresses various anthropogenic impacts on seabed habitats through its measures on MPA designation and management (measures 1, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14). In addition, it covers the pressure ‘physical damage’ related to dredging and dumping activities, and commercial fisheries using trawl nets (measures 11, 12). 

In its Article 8 reporting, Cyprus highlighted the pressure ‘physical loss’ and ‘physical damage’, identifying port operations, land claim and coastal defence activities as causes. These activities are not, however, covered by the PoM.

At a subregional level, Cyprus’ neighbour, Greece, identified physical loss as a relevant pressure and, similar to Cyprus, reported port operation, land claim and coastal defence as causes, together with marine mining, sub-marine cables and tourism and recreation. Although marine mining is not relevant for Cyprus, all of the other activities highlighted by Greece are also relevant for Cyprus' marine waters. Greece also identified physical damage as a relevant pressure under article 8, with fisheries, dredging, aquaculture, industry, agriculture and urban activities flagged as causes. Other than fisheries and dredging, these activities are not directly addressed by Cyprus’ PoM.  

Overall, it is likely that the horizontal measures on the assessment of the ecological state of the coastal environment, EIA on marine activities, and the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), take these pressures into account. Insufficient information is provided by Cyprus to confirm this. 

Furthermore, Cyprus reports several measures that aim to establish and protect new artificial reefs. However, as Cyprus reports little information for its measures, it is not clear under which conditions the artificial reefs will be placed and what objectives the Member State aims to achieve with them.

CY ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Cyprus defines GES for water column habitats as the point at which the temperature, salinity, pH, water transparency, nutrient concentrations and ratios, and oxygen are in line with prevailing physiographical, geographical and climate conditions throughout the water column. GES also aims for a normal abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton – also in line with prevailing physiographical, geographical and climate conditions - and at levels capable of ensuring their long-term abundance. 

In its PoM, Cyprus states that in its initial assessment of its marine waters (2012) physicochemical characteristics of the water column and the concentrations of chlorophyll-a used as a proxy indicator for the abundance (biomass) of phytoplankton were based on data collected under the WFD and MedPOL (the marine pollution assessment and control component of the Mediterranean Action Plan, linked to the LBS Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution from Land-Based Sources and Activities). This assessment indicated that Cyprus’ waters had achieved GES in these aspects. 

Cyprus reports, however, that current data does not allow an evaluation of phytoplankton and zooplankton populations. The relevant monitoring programmes for the MSFD will cover the lack of data for the population and the size of the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton, and will boost Cyprus’ capacity to monitor habitats of the water column.

While chemical and physical aspects of the water column are likely to be covered by Cyprus' PoM (e.g. measures reported for D5), phytoplankton and zooplankton communities and populations are not directly addressed, and thus the PoM partially addresses the GES definition.

Cyprus defines very specific targets for water column habitats in respect of the concentrations of various pollutants. The specificity of the targets is not reflected in the reported measures. However, these aspects might be covered by measures under other descriptors that address pollution in the water column (i.e. D5 and D8). The PoM therefore partially addresses the targets.

The seabed habitat GES definitions focus on ensuring that macroalgal, macroinvertebrate and angiosperm species continue to occur in their natural habitats, that their abundance and density levels ensure the long-term viability of the benthic communities, and that they are in good condition. In addition, they aim to ensure that the structure and function of ecosystems are not adversely affected by human activities. Even though the measures aim to protect seabed habitats through MPA designations and seek to reduce the pressures caused by fisheries and dredging, essential activities such as land claim and coastal defence are not addressed. The PoM thus partially addresses GES. 

Very specific targets are defined for seabed habitats, relating to macroalgae and macroinvertebrate diversity, biomass and abundance. Even though the measures cover the designation and management of MPAs, mapping of seagrass beds outside of MPAs, the creation of new artificial reefs and regulating the disposal of dredged materials, the detail of the targets is not reflected in the measures identified. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the targets. 
";"Water column habitats: GES and targets are likely to be addressed by measures reported under other descriptors, which link to pollution in the water column and chemical and physical water characteristics (D5, D8). The PoM thus partially addresses GES and targets.

GES also aims for a normal abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton – also in line with prevailing physiographical, geographical and climate conditions - and at levels capable of ensuring their long-term abundance. 

In its PoM, Cyprus states that in its initial assessment of its marine waters (2012) physicochemical characteristics of the water column and the concentrations of chlorophyll-a used as a proxy indicator for the abundance (biomass) of phytoplankton were based on data collected under the WFD and MedPOL (the marine pollution assessment and control component of the Mediterranean Action Plan, linked to the LBS Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution from Land-Based Sources and Activities). This assessment indicated that Cyprus’ waters had achieved GES in these aspects. 

Cyprus reports, however, that current data does not allow an evaluation of phytoplankton and zooplankton populations. The relevant monitoring programmes for the MSFD will cover the lack of data for the population and the size of the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton, and will boost Cyprus’ capacity to monitor habitats of the water column.

While chemical and physical aspects of the water column are likely to be covered by Cyprus' PoM (e.g. measures reported for D5), phytoplankton and zooplankton communities and populations are not directly addressed, and thus the PoM partially addresses the GES definition.

Cyprus defines very specific targets for water column habitats in respect of the concentrations of various pollutants. The specificity of the targets is not reflected in the reported measures. However, these aspects might be covered by measures under other descriptors that address pollution in the water column (i.e. D5 and D8). The PoM therefore partially addresses the targets.

The seabed habitat GES definitions focus on ensuring that macroalgal, macroinvertebrate and angiosperm species continue to occur in their natural habitats, that their abundance and density levels ensure the long-term viability of the benthic communities, and that they are in good condition. In addition, they aim to ensure that the structure and function of ecosystems are not adversely affected by human activities. Even though the measures aim to protect seabed habitats through MPA designations and seek to reduce the pressures caused by fisheries and dredging, essential activities such as land claim and coastal defence are not addressed. The PoM thus partially addresses GES. 

Very specific targets are defined for seabed habitats, relating to macroalgae and macroinvertebrate diversity, biomass and abundance. Even though the measures cover the designation and management of MPAs, mapping of seagrass beds outside of MPAs, the creation of new artificial reefs and regulating the disposal of dredged materials, the detail of the targets is not reflected in the measures identified. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the targets. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: GES and targets are likely to be addressed by measures reported under other descriptors, which link to pollution in the water column and chemical and physical water characteristics (D5, D8). The PoM thus partially addresses GES and targets. 

Seabed habitats: The measures partially ensure that macroalgal, macroinvertebrate and angiosperm species continue to occur in their natural habitats, that their abundance and density levels ensure the long-term viability of the group, and that they are in good condition. Measures mostly cover spatial protection concerns and aim to reduce fishing and dredging pressures, but do not address essential seabed impacting activities and therefore partly address GES and targets.

DE ;ATL ;13;D1-B;Coverage of pressures;"Instead of addressing pressures specifically, a large number of Germany’s measures aim to reduce human impacts on the marine environment overall. For birds, these general measures cover marine spatial planning, MPA designations, and the management of funding programmes (M915-other, M924-other, M505-WFD). 

Germany aims to address physical damage caused by fishing activities through a number of measures (M917-other, M919-other, M412-UZ4-02) and one measure to address various other activities (including fisheries, shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) (M409-UZ3-01). In addition, Germany reports a range of measures that address physical damage for which the activities addressed have not been specified (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other, M928-other, M929-other). These measures will cover integrated coastal zone management, licensing procedures for marine activities, species and habitats protection measures (including voluntary political agreements), and the implementation of the Habitats and Birds Directives. 

Furthermore, Germany reports that the pressure physical loss, caused by fishing activities and by various other activities (incl. shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research), is being addressed by two measures (M409-UZ3-01, M412-UZ4-02 respectively). Destructive fishing activities mostly affect seabed habitats and not breeding sites of birds on land, they will affect habitats which are feeding grounds for marine birds e.g. sea ducks which feed on benthic molluscs. Hence, birds can also be affected by the damage or destruction of these seabed habitats. 

Moreover, Germany reports that they have addressed the pressure biological disturbance caused by the extraction of species (M926-other, M927-other, M412-UZ4-02, M413-UZ4-03). Germany wants to particularly focus on seabird by-catch from fisheries by applying a new fisheries management measure (M412-UZ4-02).

Germany links its PoM to a number of WFD-linked activities that aim to address the pressure habitat loss, such as through protecting habitats, including wetlands, and by improving the hydromorphological conditions of rivers and coasts (M070-WFD to M075-WFD, M077-WFD, M082-WFD). Germany will also address habitat loss by a measure that foresees an assessment procedure prior to the construction of offshore windfarms, in order to estimate the impact of the constructions on the loss of habitats for loons (Gavia spp.) (M922-other). 

Germany reported one new and one completely new measure that address the visual disturbance of birds from lights (M410-UZ3-02, M430-UZ6-06). It seeks to address the pressure by reducing and by managing lighting on offshore platforms and from other at-sea light sources in a way sustainable to bird populations. 

Finally, the Member State also aims at addressing the pressure introduction of energy, and in particular on noise, through measures covering approval procedures for marine activities and species and habitat protection measures (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other). 

At the regional level, Germany links its PoM for birds to OSPAR, HELCOM, and to the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation. ";The reported groups of measures address the main pressures from fishing (including by-catch) and habitat loss, through fisheries management and spatial protection measures. Furthermore, visual light disturbances from human-made structures are addressed. ;3;Addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details
DE ;ATL ;13;D1-B;Coverage of GES and targets;"Germany has defined a general overarching GES and targets which address all relevant species groups. 

The GES definition refers to a number of EU Directives (WFD, Habitats Directive, Birds Directive) and regional agreements (OSPAR, HELCOM, Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation) that are relevant for birds. The assessment finds that the Member State has designed its PoM to achieve the GES, given that the Member State links to all of the relevant Directives and agreements for birds in its PoM. Even though Germany does not specify which species it is addressing through its PoM, it states that it covers those species listed under the Birds  Directive, which covers all wild bird species, in addition to HELCOM and OSPAR lists of endangered species where ecologically relevant. Hence, it is likely that the relevant species will be addressed to support the achievement of the GES. Overall, the measures will support the achievement of GES for birds (D1, 4).

Targets 1, 2 and 4 are relevant for birds. Germany’s PoM includes the implementation of MPAs in German waters, which will support the achievement of target 1, which aims at creating sufficient spatial and temporal refuge and resting areas for marine species, including birds. However, target 1 also refers to breeding grounds, which are not specifically mentioned as being addressed by the measures. Nevertheless, these areas are protected by the existing measures under the Birds and Habitats Directives. 

Secondly, target 2 is addressed by the PoM as the Member State aims to address the incidental by-catch of birds during fishing activities through fisheries management measures and an environmental awareness campaign for the general public. Furthermore, target 2 relates to the protection of food sources for species. Several fisheries management measures reported for birds address physical damage, which in turn will likely support the protection of bird feeding grounds. Germany addresses target 4 because its PoM includes a number of measures that aims to reduce impairments from human marine activities on migratory species, including birds. Germany particularly focuses on reducing visual disturbances from offshore platforms, such as from windfarms, in migration corridors. Germany’s measures address the targets for birds (D1, 4)";The measures address GES and targets as the Member State links to all the relevant directives and agreements for birds in its PoM (WFD, Habitats Directive, Birds Directive, OSPAR, HELCOM, Wadden Sea Plan). The PoM will support the protection of refuge and resting areas through MPA management. Bird food sources will be protected through seabed habitat protection measures. By-catch is addressed and the impact on migratory species from offshore platforms will be reduced by measures on disturbances from man-made structures, i.e. lighting.;3;Addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details

The hydromorphological and sedimentological information system measure is not expected to be implemented before 2018 (M431-UZ7-01) (relevant for seabed habitats).

DE ;ATL ;13;D1-F;Coverage of pressures;"Germany reports measures for fish that include general marine spatial planning measures, MPA designations, and management and funding programmes (M915-other, M924-other, M505-WFD). Germany also reports measures that address physical damage through coastal zone management, licensing procedures for marine activities, species and habitat protection measures (including voluntary political agreements), and the joint implementation of the Habitats and Birds Directives (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, BALDE/ANSD-M923-other, M928-other, M929-other), for which the relevant activities causing the pressure have not been reported. 

Physical damage caused by fishing activities and from various other activities (shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) is addressed through a series of measures (M917-other, M919-other, M409-UZ3-01, M412-UZ4-02). Physical loss is addressed through measures linked either to fishing (M412-UZ4-02) or to various other activities (shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) (M409-UZ3-01). 

The Member State also reports the pressure biological disturbance through the extraction of species caused by fisheries, and addresses it through several measures (M926-other, M927-other, M412-UZ4-02, M413-UZ4-03). Germany also reports measure M929-other to address biological disturbance, but does not specify which activity this measure addresses. Measure M412-UZ4-02 in particular, aims at reducing the number of catches of non-target species and discards particularly by supporting the use of sustainable fishing gears. 

As for birds, Germany reports that the pressure of habitat loss, caused by activities impacting upon hydromorphological conditions, is addressed by a range of measures related to the WFD (M070-WFD to M075-WFD, M077-WFD, M082-WFD). 

Germany has identified a pressure related to the reduction of longitudinal continuity and has reported measures to address this. Firstly, Germany reports a measure that covers the National Action Plan on the resettlement of the sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) (M920-other) but does not report which pressures or activities impact the sturgeon population. Furthermore, Germany has identified that activities which cause obstacles for migratory fish on rivers and streams, such as the construction of dams, contribute to this pressure. The reduction of these obstacles is addressed by a number of measures (M068-WFD, M069-WFD, M076-WFD, M910-other). Germany has also identified industrial water uptake devices as threats for migratory species and has reported a measure that aims to make these devices more ecologically friendly, in order to reduce their impact (M410-UZ3-02). 

Finally, Germany reports a number of measures that address the pressure inputs of energy, including noise. For some of these measures the activities causing the pressure have not been identified (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other). The measures cover procedures for marine activities, and species and habitat protection measures. In addition, Germany reports one fisheries measure to address the pressure of introduction of energy (M413-UZ4-03). Furthermore, Germany identifies the activities shipping, sand and gravel extraction, offshore constructions, explosions, seismic activities, and offshore windfarms as relevant for the pressure noise. The Member State aims to address this pressure through two measures on underwater noise reduction (M425-UZ6-01, M428-UZ6-04).

On a regional level, Germany refers to OSPAR, HELCOM and the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation for fish and cephalopods. ";The reported measures cover the improvement and support of application of sustainable and environmental friendly fishing techniques, which should also reduce discards of target and non-target species. Furthermore, endangered and migratory species are being addressed by the PoM and even the impact of underwater noise is considered. ;3;Addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details
DE ;ATL ;13;D1-F;Coverage of GES and targets;"As in the case for birds, the German GES is general and refers to EU Directives and international agreements, for which the Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan, OSPAR Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQO), and HELCOM BSAP are relevant for fish. It is likely that the measures will support the achievement of GES, given that the Member State included all of these agreements and Directives in its PoM. Germany reports a large number of measures for fish that cover a wide range of aspects related to fish biodiversity, such as MPAs, no-take zones, impacts of sound, migratory pathways, reintroduction of sturgeon, and the protection of endangered species. These fish measures should be sufficient to progress towards GES and ensure that relevant species are in good condition or achieve a favourable conservation status in the North and Baltic Seas. However, Germany does not specify which fish species are being addressed by its measures, apart from sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) and the reference to migratory species, even though it does not specify for the later which specific migratory species are addressed. Nevertheless, Germany reports, in their MPAs, that they protect all species listed in the Habitats Directive and on the HELCOM and OSPAR lists of endangered species - where ecologically relevant. Therefore, it is likely that the relevant species are being addressed by the German PoM. Overall, the measures will support the achievement of the GES for fish and cephalopods (D1, 4).

All four targets are relevant for the fish measures. As required by target 1, the German PoM covers the implementation of MPAs, so the measures will support the achievement of the target. Secondly, Germany’s PoM includes the protection of migratory fish species, as required by target 4, and in particular includes a measure on sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) resettlement, as required by target 3. By-catch rates and discard rates, as defined in target 2, will be sufficiently addressed by a fisheries management measure that aims to reduce by-catch and discards of target and non-target species and additional measures on fisheries regulations in MPAs and Natura 2000 sites. Germany’s measures therefore, address the targets for fish and cephalopods (D1, 4). ";The measures address the pressures to ensure that relevant species are in good condition and achieve a favourable conservation status, as Germany links to all relevant directives (Habitats Directive, Wadden Sea Plan, OSPAR EcoQO, HELCOM BSAP). They address the implementation of MPAs with restricted fishing activities. Also, they address by-catch rates and the development and application of selective fishing gears.

The Member State reports to address physical damage through a range of general measures without specifying which activities will be addressed by those measures (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other, M928-other, M929-other). These measures address physical damage through coastal zone management, licensing procedures for marine activities, and species and habitat protection. Germany also reports physical damage caused by fisheries and other activities (i.e. shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) to be covered by measures in its PoM (M917-other, M919-other, M409-UZ3-01, M412-UZ4-02).

Germany reports addressing physical loss, caused either through fisheries or various activities (including fisheries, shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) with two measures (M412-UZ4-02, M409-UZ3-01).

The by-catch of marine mammals is identified as a pressure that results from fishing activities and is addressed by the German PoM through a number of measures (M926-other, M927-other, M929-other, M410-UZ4-01, M412-UZ4-02). 

Finally, Germany reports a range of measures that address the pressure inputs of energy, and noise in particular, caused by various activities, such as shipping, sand and gravel extraction, offshore constructions, explosions, seismic activities, and offshore windfarms (M410-UZ3-02, M425-UZ6-01, M428-UZ6-04).

DE ;ATL ;13;D1-M;Coverage of GES and targets;"The Directives and international agreements relevant for marine mammals, as listed in the GES definition, are the Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan (including the Convention for conservation of seals) and ASCOBANS. Germany links its mammal measures to these Directives and agreements, wherefore it is likely that the measures will contribute to the achievement of GES. The PoM focusses on noise, migratory species and by-catch reduction for mammals. The single mammal species mentioned in the PoM is the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Seals are not specifically mentioned in the PoM, although they are included in the GES definition. However, it is likely that seals are addressed by the PoM as Germany refers to the international Convention for conservation of seals in the Wadden Sea, but this cannot be verified. In addition, Germany states that it focuses its protection in MPAs on all species listed under the Habitats Directive and on the OSPAR and HELCOM endangered species lists, wherefore the relevant species are likely covered by the PoM. Overall, the measures will support the achievement of GES for mammals (D1, 4).

Targets 1, 2, and 4 are relevant for mammals. Target 1 is being addressed through a number of measures on MPAs and fishing regulations in those sites (including Natura 2000 sites), which will likely support the reduction of marine mammals’ by-catch. Target 2 also refers to by-catch and is, therefore, also addressed by those MPA’s measures in addition to fisheries’ measures that aim at reducing by-catch.

Physical damage caused by fishing activities and from various other activities (shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) is addressed through a series of measures (M917-other, M919-other, M409-UZ3-01, M412-UZ4-02). Physical loss is addressed through measures linked either to fishing (M412-UZ4-02) or to various other activities (shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) (M409-UZ3-01). 

The Member State also reports the pressure biological disturbance through the extraction of species caused by fisheries, and addresses it through several measures (M926-other, M927-other, M412-UZ4-02, M413-UZ4-03). Germany also reports measure M929-other to address biological disturbance, but does not specify which activity this measure addresses. Measure M412-UZ4-02 in particular, aims at reducing the number of catches of non-target species and discards particularly by supporting the use of sustainable fishing gears. 

As for birds, Germany reports that the pressure of habitat loss, caused by activities impacting upon hydromorphological conditions, is addressed by a range of measures related to the WFD (M070-WFD to M075-WFD, M077-WFD, M082-WFD). 

Germany has identified a pressure related to the reduction of longitudinal continuity and has reported measures to address this. Firstly, Germany reports a measure that covers the National Action Plan on the resettlement of the sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) (M920-other) but does not report which pressures or activities impact the sturgeon population. Furthermore, Germany has identified that activities which cause obstacles for migratory fish on rivers and streams, such as the construction of dams, contribute to this pressure. The reduction of these obstacles is addressed by a number of measures (M068-WFD, M069-WFD, M076-WFD, M910-other). Germany has also identified industrial water uptake devices as threats for migratory species and has reported a measure that aims to make these devices more ecologically friendly, in order to reduce their impact (M410-UZ3-02). 

Finally, Germany reports a number of measures that address the pressure inputs of energy, including noise. For some of these measures the activities causing the pressure have not been identified (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other). The measures cover procedures for marine activities, and species and habitat protection measures. In addition, Germany reports one fisheries measure to address the pressure of introduction of energy (M413-UZ4-03). Furthermore, Germany identifies the activities shipping, sand and gravel extraction, offshore constructions, explosions, seismic activities, and offshore windfarms as relevant for the pressure noise. The Member State aims to address this pressure through two measures on underwater noise reduction (M425-UZ6-01, M428-UZ6-04).

On a regional level, Germany refers to OSPAR, HELCOM and the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation for fish and cephalopods. ";o	Fish and cephalopods: The reported measures cover the improvement and support of application of sustainable and environmental friendly fishing techniques, which should also reduce discards of target and non-target species.

DE ;ATL ;13;D1-C;Coverage of GES and targets;"As in the case for birds, the German GES is general and refers to EU Directives and international agreements, for which the Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan, OSPAR Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQO), and HELCOM BSAP are relevant for fish. It is likely that the measures will support the achievement of GES, given that the Member State included all of these agreements and Directives in its PoM. Germany reports a large number of measures for fish that cover a wide range of aspects related to fish biodiversity, such as MPAs, no-take zones, impacts of sound, migratory pathways, reintroduction of sturgeon, and the protection of endangered species. These fish measures should be sufficient to progress towards GES and ensure that relevant species are in good condition or achieve a favourable conservation status in the North and Baltic Seas. However, Germany does not specify which fish species are being addressed by its measures, apart from sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) and the reference to migratory species, even though it does not specify for the later which specific migratory species are addressed. Nevertheless, Germany reports, in their MPAs, that they protect all species listed in the Habitats Directive and on the HELCOM and OSPAR lists of endangered species - where ecologically relevant. Therefore, it is likely that the relevant species are being addressed by the German PoM. Overall, the measures will support the achievement of the GES for fish and cephalopods (D1, 4).

All four targets are relevant for the fish measures. As required by target 1, the German PoM covers the implementation of MPAs, so the measures will support the achievement of the target. Secondly, Germany’s PoM includes the protection of migratory fish species, as required by target 4, and in particular includes a measure on sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) resettlement, as required by target 3. By-catch rates and discard rates, as defined in target 2, will be sufficiently addressed by a fisheries management measure that aims to reduce by-catch and discards of target and non-target species and additional measures on fisheries regulations in MPAs and Natura 2000 sites. Germany’s measures therefore, address the targets for fish and cephalopods (D1, 4). ";The measures address the pressures to ensure that relevant species are in good condition and achieve a favourable conservation status, as Germany links to all relevant directives (Habitats Directive, Wadden Sea Plan, OSPAR EcoQO, HELCOM BSAP). They address the implementation of MPAs with restricted fishing activities. Also, they address by-catch rates and the development and application of selective fishing gears. Endangered species will be addressed, including a resettlement programme for the sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), as required by the target. The reduction of the impact of man-made structures on migratory fish species is addressed by the PoM.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details

Germany does not report a timeline for the achievement of the GES in its PoM. However, the Member State reports that the measures are adequate to achieve GES. 

Timeline of implementing the PoM
The Member State reports when its new and completely new measures will be implemented. Most of the new measures will be implemented by 2016. The hydromorphological and sedimentological information system measure is not expected to be implemented before 2018 (M431-UZ7-01) (relevant for seabed habitats). The mussel management plan in the  Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park has been in existence since 1999 and is being updated every five years and the next updating cycle will begin in 2019 (M413-UZ4-03) (relevant for birds, fish, and seabed habitats). No date has been reported for the timeline to implement the sustainable fisheries awareness campaign (M411-UZ4-01), given that Germany states that it will implement this measure as soon as it has been agreed upon by all parties (relevant for birds, fish, mammals, and seabed habitats). ";"While most measures are in place by 2016, other measures are reported to be implemented after 2016 or the reported timeline for measures is not clear.

DE ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Overall, Germany reports addressing various pressures and activities through measures related to environmental legislation implementation, MPA management, and funding programmes for water column habitats (M915-other, M924-other, M505-WFD).

Germany considers physical damage to be a relevant pressure on water column habitats and reports one measure addressing fisheries impacts (M412-UZ4-02) and one measure addressing various activities’ impacts (including shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) (M409-UZ3-01). In addition, Germany reports that two measures address physical damage (M923-other, M928-other) through approval procedures for projects and environmental regulations related to the Birds and Habitats Directives. 

Germany reports two measures that address physical loss related to fisheries (M412-UZ4-02) and to other relevant activities (including shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) (M409-UZ3-01).

The Member State identifies the biological disturbance by the extraction of species, caused by fishing activities, as a pressure relevant for water column habitats and addresses the pressure through a number of fisheries management measures (M926-other, M927-other, M412-UZ4-02). 

Germany reports that the pressure habitat loss regarding seabed habitats, which is caused by activities impacting upon hydromorphological conditions, will be addressed by a range of measures related to the WFD (M070-WFD to M075-WFD, M077-WFD, M082-WFD). An improvement of hydromorphological conditions is likely to have a positive impact on water column habitats. Furthermore, the measure M064-WFD directly aims to reduce run-off peaks which will improve water quality. 

The pressure input of energy, including noise, caused by various activities, including shipping, sand and gravel extraction, offshore constructions, explosions, seismic activities, and offshore windfarms will be addressed by two of Germany’s measures (M425-UZ6-01, M428-UZ6-04).

Even though these measures address some aspects relevant for causing pressures on water column habitats, essential pressures, including contaminants and nutrient enrichment are likely to be covered by measures under other descriptors (D2, D5, D8, D10, .). However, it is not clear which measures from D2, D5, D8 and D10 specifically contribute to addressing pressures on water column habitats and how. As such, the measures are likely to partially address pressures on water column habitats. 

At the regional level, Germany links its PoM for water column habitats to OSPAR, HELCOM and the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation. 

As for the other species groups, mentioned above, Germany reports that they have addressed various pressures and activities for seabed habitats through measures on environmental legislation implementation, MPA management, and funding programs (M915-other, M924-other, M505-WFD).

Under Article 8, Germany reports that several activities cause physical loss in both (sub)regions, such as marine-based renewable energy generation, placement and operation of offshore structures and solid waste disposal. Furthermore, they report that in the North Sea hydrocarbon exploitation is relevant. The PoM covers placement and operation of offshore structures (M409-UZ3-01), however, it is not clear from the reported information to what extend the other three activities are addressed. Furthermore, Germany covers fisheries impacts (M412-UZ4-02), in addition to a number of other relevant activities (including shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) (M409-UZ3-01). Germany’s measures are addressing these activities, given that the Member State aims to reduce or ban a range of activities, including the extraction of marine non-living resources and renewable energy structures, in MPAs. However, Germany has not referred to solid waste disposal activities in its measures. Therefore, it is not clear whether these activities have been addressed or not.

Regarding physical damage, Germany reported under Article 8 that fisheries and marine mining (of sand, gravel and rock) were causing this pressure in both subregions, in addition to shipping in the North Sea. Germany’s PoM covers shipping, fisheries management and fishing restrictions and bans in MPAs, in addition to restrictions for the extraction of non-living resources in MPAs. Hence, the pressure of physical damage and its relevant activities are partially addressed by Germany and are addressed fully in the MPAs. 
Nevertheless, other various activities (including shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) are covered by the PoM (M917-other, M919-other, M412-UZ4-02, M414-UZ4-04, M409-UZ3-01).
Furthermore, Germany reports that the pressure ‘physical damage’ will be addressed by measures on coastal zone management, licensing procedures for marine activities, species and habitats protection (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other, M928-other, M929-other), for which the relevant activities have not been reported. 

The biological disturbance by the extraction of species, caused by fishing activities primarily, is addressed through a number of the German measures (M926-other, M927-other, M412-UZ4-02, M413-UZ4-03). Germany reports that a reduction of seabed habitat destruction by fishing gear will lead to an improvement of the habitat itself, but also to the overall food web (Descriptor 4). The Member State wants to support the improvement and application of less seabed impacting fishing gear to reduce this pressure (M412-UZ4-02). Furthermore, it reports an existing measure on coastal zone management which will also address fisheries impacts on seabed habitats (M929-other). 

Germany reports that the pressure habitat loss of seabed habitats, which is caused by activities impacting hydromorphological conditions, will be addressed by a range of measures related to the WFD (M070-WFD to M075-WFD, M077-WFD, M082-WFD, M064-WFD).

One pressure related to endangered benthic species has been identified and Germany reports a resettlement plan for the lobster (Homarus gammarus) in the North Sea (M921-other). However, Germany does not specify which activities will be addressed to reduce the pressure placed upon the species. 

Germany also considers the input of energy, including noise, caused by various activities, including shipping, sand and gravel extraction, offshore constructions, explosions, seismic activities, and offshore windfarms, as a relevant pressure on seabed habitats and reports two measures that address these activities (M425-UZ6-01, M428-UZ6-04). Germany also reports a fisheries measure that is relevant to addressing this pressure (M413-UZ4-03). In addition, Germany reports a number of measures as being relevant for addressing this pressure for seabed habitats; however, it does not specify which activities they will address (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other). 


At the subregional level, in the North Sea most Member States identified marine-based renewable energy, urban and solid waste disposal activities as relevant for causing physical loss and fisheries, marine mining and shipping as relevant for causing shipping. In the Baltic Sea, most Member States reported marine-based renewable energy to cause physical loss and fisheries to cause physical damage. Most of these activities have been identified by Germany and are addressed by its measures. Nevertheless, unlike neighbouring Member States, land claim and coastal defence were not reported by Germany under Article 8 and no measures have been reported to address this activity. 

On a regional level, Germany refers to OSPAR, HELCOM, and the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation for its seabed habitats’ PoM. ";"Water column habitats: Even though no specific water column habitat measure have been reported, spatial protection measures and measures aiming at improving seabed habitat condition and reduce waste water runoff will contribute to a reduction of pressures on water column habitats. Furthermore, measures reported under D2, D5 and D8 will contribute to a reduction of important pressures for this habitat. Nevertheless, Germany does not clearly identify how these measures will address relevant pressures on this habitat. Hence, the measures partially address the pressures on these habitats. 

Seabed habitats: The reported groups of measures address physical loss and damage pressures from fishing activities, in addition to habitat loss. However, the PoM does not provide information on how a number of activities causing these pressures are addressed, although they were reported under Article 8 (such as marine hydrocarbon extraction, marine-based renewable energy generation, solid waste disposal). Therefore, pressures are partially covered.";2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details
DE ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"The GES definitions that are relevant for water column habitats refer to achieving good ecological status and good chemical status according to the WFD for coastal and territorial waters respectively. The Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQO) of OSPAR and HELCOM BSAP are also relevant. Overall, Germany does not report specific water column habitats measures in its PoM, but does link its bird, fish, mammals and seabed measures to water column habitats. Germany does not explicitly report which measures from other descriptor address chemical status specifically for water column habitats, but it is likely that measures improving the conditions of seabed habitats, in addition to WFD measures and spatial protection measures will have positive effects on water column habitats. Therefore, the German PoM will partially support the achievement of GES. 

No target refers to water column habitats specifically; therefore, assessment towards targets cannot be made for water column habitats.

The Directives and international agreements relevant for seabed habitats are the Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan, and Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQO) of OSPAR and HELCOM BSAP. Germany refers to all of these Directives and agreements in its PoM; in this way, it will likely contribute to the achievement of the GES. However, the PoM does not include measures that aim to protect seabed habitats from destructive offshore activities, apart from noise input or in MPAs; thus, it is not clear if the PoM will be sufficient to achieving a sustainable conservation status for seabed habitats. The PoM also mentions one species specifically (lobster Homarus gammarus). Nevertheless, Germany reports that they include the protection of seabed habitats, as listed under the Habitats Directive and the OSPAR and – where ecologically relevant - HELCOM habitats listed for protection, in its regulations for MPAs. Therefore, it is likely that the relevant species will be addressed by the PoM. Overall, the measures partially address the GES for seabed habitats (D1,4,6).

All four targets are relevant for seabed habitats in German waters. Target 1 is likely to be addressed, given that the PoM covers MPA implementation measures, including fisheries restrictions in MPAs, which can contribute to an improvement of seabed habitat condition. By-catch and destruction of seabed habitats will also be addressed by the PoM, as required by target 2, firstly through the fisheries restriction measures in MPAs and secondly, through a fisheries management measure, aimed at reducing the impact of fishing gears on seabed habitats. Target 3 is not fully addressed, given that the PoM covers the mentioned species lobster (Homarus gammarus), and Germany foresees no resettlement measure for the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) as required by the target. This represents a clear gap. The impact of man-made structures on seabed habitats is also addressed by the measures regarding underwater noise. However, underwater noise does not represent a major issue for marine invertebrates, compared to underwater constructions, which are mostly responsible for pressures resulting from the placement and maintenance of offshore structures. This aspect is likely not to be covered by the German PoM, thus the measures are partially addressing the targets for seabed habitats (D1,4,6). ";"Water column habitats: Germany does not present specific measures for these habitats, however, measures aimed at improving the condition of seabed habitats, in addition to WFD measures,spatial protection measures and measures reported under other descriptors (D2, D5, D8) will partially address GES. No targets have been reported for water column habitats. 

Seabed habitats: The measures link to all relevant policies (Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan, EcoQO of OSPAR, HELCOM BSAP) as defined by the GES. Moreover, they address the benthic habitats targets by implementing MPAs with restricted fishing activities and reduce seabed destruction through fisheries measures. Also, a measure on the resettlement of the lobster (Homarus gammarus) has been reported. However, no resettlement measure for the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) has been reported, which represents a gap. Furthermore, the impact of human-made structures on seabed habitats has not been sufficiently addressed and the PoM does not include measures which aim at protecting seabed habitats from destructive offshore activities, apart from noise input or in MPAs.

The Member State aims to address this pressure through two measures on underwater noise reduction (M425-UZ6-01, M428-UZ6-04).

On a regional level, Germany refers to OSPAR, HELCOM and the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation for fish and cephalopods. 

Regarding the pressures assessment for mammals, as well as for other species groups, a number of measures have been reported that address overall pressures and activities in the marine environment. These relate to environmental legislation implementation, MPA management, and funding programmes (M915-other, M924-other, M501-WFD, M503-WFD, M505-WFD). 

The Member State reports to address physical damage through a range of general measures without specifying which activities will be addressed by those measures (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other, M928-other, M929-other). These measures address physical damage through coastal zone management, licensing procedures for marine activities, and species and habitat protection. Germany also reports physical damage caused by fisheries and other activities (i.e. shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) to be covered by measures in its PoM (M917-other, M919-other, M409-UZ3-01, M412-UZ4-02).

DE ;ATL ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
As in the case for birds, the German GES is general and refers to EU Directives and international agreements, for which the Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan, OSPAR Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQO), and HELCOM BSAP are relevant for fish. It is likely that the measures will support the achievement of GES, given that the Member State included all of these agreements and Directives in its PoM. Germany reports a large number of measures for fish that cover a wide range of aspects related to fish biodiversity, such as MPAs, no-take zones, impacts of sound, migratory pathways, reintroduction of sturgeon, and the protection of endangered species. These fish measures should be sufficient to progress towards GES and ensure that relevant species are in good condition or achieve a favourable conservation status in the North and Baltic Seas. However, Germany does not specify which fish species are being addressed by its measures, apart from sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) and the reference to migratory species, even though it does not specify for the later which specific migratory species are addressed. Nevertheless, Germany reports, in their MPAs, that they protect all species listed in the Habitats Directive and on the HELCOM and OSPAR lists of endangered species - where ecologically relevant. Therefore, it is likely that the relevant species are being addressed by the German PoM. Overall, the measures will support the achievement of the GES for fish and cephalopods (D1, 4).

All four targets are relevant for the fish measures. As required by target 1, the German PoM covers the implementation of MPAs, so the measures will support the achievement of the target. Secondly, Germany’s PoM includes the protection of migratory fish species, as required by target 4, and in particular includes a measure on sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) resettlement, as required by target 3. By-catch rates and discard rates, as defined in target 2, will be sufficiently addressed by a fisheries management measure that aims to reduce by-catch and discards of target and non-target species and additional measures on fisheries regulations in MPAs and Natura 2000 sites. Germany’s measures therefore, address the targets for fish and cephalopods (D1, 4). 

The Directives and international agreements relevant for marine mammals, as listed in the GES definition, are the Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan (including the Convention for conservation of seals) and ASCOBANS. Germany links its mammal measures to these Directives and agreements, wherefore it is likely that the measures will contribute to the achievement of GES. The PoM focusses on noise, migratory species and by-catch reduction for mammals. The single mammal species mentioned in the PoM is the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Seals are not specifically mentioned in the PoM, although they are included in the GES definition. However, it is likely that seals are addressed by the PoM as Germany refers to the international Convention for conservation of seals in the Wadden Sea, but this cannot be verified. In addition, Germany states that it focuses its protection in MPAs on all species listed under the Habitats Directive and on the OSPAR and HELCOM endangered species lists, wherefore the relevant species are likely covered by the PoM. Overall, the measures will support the achievement of GES for mammals (D1, 4).

Targets 1, 2, and 4 are relevant for mammals. Target 1 is being addressed through a number of measures on MPAs and fishing regulations in those sites (including Natura 2000 sites), which will likely support the reduction of marine mammals’ by-catch. Target 2 also refers to by-catch and is, therefore, also addressed by those MPA’s measures in addition to fisheries’ measures that aim at reducing by-catch. Target 4 is also addressed, given that Germany reports several measures on underwater noise reduction from man-made structures, to the migratory corridors of marine mammals in particular. Hence, Germany’s measures address the targets for mammals (D1, 4). ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Fish and cephalopods: The measures address the pressures to ensure that relevant species are in good condition and achieve a favourable conservation status, as Germany links to all relevant directives (Habitats Directive, Wadden Sea Plan, OSPAR EcoQO, HELCOM BSAP). They address the implementation of MPAs with restricted fishing activities. Also, they address by-catch rates and the development and application of selective fishing gears. Endangered species will be addressed, including a resettlement programme for the sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), as required by the target. The reduction of the impact of man-made structures on migratory fish species is addressed by the PoM.

Mammals: The measures address GES and targets as the Member State links to all the relevant directives and agreements for birds in its PoM (OSPAR, HELCOM, Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan, ASCOBANS). They address the creation of spatial and temporal refuge areas for mammals regarding noise pollution. By-catch will be reduced by more sustainable fishing methods and restricted fishing activities in MPAs. They will address impact on migratory species from man-made structures, such as noise pollution inputs from offshore structures.";3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details

Timeline of implementing the PoM
The Member State reports when its new and completely new measures will be implemented. Most of the new measures will be implemented by 2016. The hydromorphological and sedimentological information system measure is not expected to be implemented before 2018 (M431-UZ7-01) (relevant for seabed habitats). The mussel management plan in the  Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park has been in existence since 1999 and is being updated every five years and the next updating cycle will begin in 2019 (M413-UZ4-03) (relevant for birds, fish, and seabed habitats).

DE ;ATL ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessement  
Overall, Germany reports addressing various pressures and activities through measures related to environmental legislation implementation, MPA management, and funding programmes for water column habitats (M915-other, M924-other, M505-WFD).

Germany considers physical damage to be a relevant pressure on water column habitats and reports one measure addressing fisheries impacts (M412-UZ4-02) and one measure addressing various activities’ impacts (including shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) (M409-UZ3-01). In addition, Germany reports that two measures address physical damage (M923-other, M928-other) through approval procedures for projects and environmental regulations related to the Birds and Habitats Directives. 

Germany reports two measures that address physical loss related to fisheries (M412-UZ4-02) and to other relevant activities (including shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) (M409-UZ3-01).

The Member State identifies the biological disturbance by the extraction of species, caused by fishing activities, as a pressure relevant for water column habitats and addresses the pressure through a number of fisheries management measures (M926-other, M927-other, M412-UZ4-02). 

Germany reports that the pressure habitat loss regarding seabed habitats, which is caused by activities impacting upon hydromorphological conditions, will be addressed by a range of measures related to the WFD (M070-WFD to M075-WFD, M077-WFD, M082-WFD). An improvement of hydromorphological conditions is likely to have a positive impact on water column habitats. Furthermore, the measure M064-WFD directly aims to reduce run-off peaks which will improve water quality. 

The pressure input of energy, including noise, caused by various activities, including shipping, sand and gravel extraction, offshore constructions, explosions, seismic activities, and offshore windfarms will be addressed by two of Germany’s measures (M425-UZ6-01, M428-UZ6-04).

Even though these measures address some aspects relevant for causing pressures on water column habitats, essential pressures, including contaminants and nutrient enrichment are likely to be covered by measures under other descriptors (D2, D5, D8, D10, .). However, it is not clear which measures from D2, D5, D8 and D10 specifically contribute to addressing pressures on water column habitats and how. As such, the measures are likely to partially address pressures on water column habitats. 

At the regional level, Germany links its PoM for water column habitats to OSPAR, HELCOM and the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation. 

As for the other species groups, mentioned above, Germany reports that they have addressed various pressures and activities for seabed habitats through measures on environmental legislation implementation, MPA management, and funding programs (M915-other, M924-other, M505-WFD).

Under Article 8, Germany reports that several activities cause physical loss in both (sub)regions, such as marine-based renewable energy generation, placement and operation of offshore structures and solid waste disposal. Furthermore, they report that in the North Sea hydrocarbon exploitation is relevant. The PoM covers placement and operation of offshore structures (M409-UZ3-01), however, it is not clear from the reported information to what extend the other three activities are addressed. Furthermore, Germany covers fisheries impacts (M412-UZ4-02), in addition to a number of other relevant activities (including shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) (M409-UZ3-01). Germany’s measures are addressing these activities, given that the Member State aims to reduce or ban a range of activities, including the extraction of marine non-living resources and renewable energy structures, in MPAs. However, Germany has not referred to solid waste disposal activities in its measures. Therefore, it is not clear whether these activities have been addressed or not.

Regarding physical damage, Germany reported under Article 8 that fisheries and marine mining (of sand, gravel and rock) were causing this pressure in both subregions, in addition to shipping in the North Sea. Germany’s PoM covers shipping, fisheries management and fishing restrictions and bans in MPAs, in addition to restrictions for the extraction of non-living resources in MPAs. Hence, the pressure of physical damage and its relevant activities are partially addressed by Germany and are addressed fully in the MPAs. 
Nevertheless, other various activities (including shipping, recreation, extraction of non-living resources, research) are covered by the PoM (M917-other, M919-other, M412-UZ4-02, M414-UZ4-04, M409-UZ3-01).
Furthermore, Germany reports that the pressure ‘physical damage’ will be addressed by measures on coastal zone management, licensing procedures for marine activities, species and habitats protection (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other, M928-other, M929-other), for which the relevant activities have not been reported. 

The biological disturbance by the extraction of species, caused by fishing activities primarily, is addressed through a number of the German measures (M926-other, M927-other, M412-UZ4-02, M413-UZ4-03). Germany reports that a reduction of seabed habitat destruction by fishing gear will lead to an improvement of the habitat itself, but also to the overall food web (Descriptor 4). The Member State wants to support the improvement and application of less seabed impacting fishing gear to reduce this pressure (M412-UZ4-02). Furthermore, it reports an existing measure on coastal zone management which will also address fisheries impacts on seabed habitats (M929-other). 

Germany reports that the pressure habitat loss of seabed habitats, which is caused by activities impacting hydromorphological conditions, will be addressed by a range of measures related to the WFD (M070-WFD to M075-WFD, M077-WFD, M082-WFD, M064-WFD).

One pressure related to endangered benthic species has been identified and Germany reports a resettlement plan for the lobster (Homarus gammarus) in the North Sea (M921-other). However, Germany does not specify which activities will be addressed to reduce the pressure placed upon the species. 

Germany also considers the input of energy, including noise, caused by various activities, including shipping, sand and gravel extraction, offshore constructions, explosions, seismic activities, and offshore windfarms, as a relevant pressure on seabed habitats and reports two measures that address these activities (M425-UZ6-01, M428-UZ6-04). Germany also reports a fisheries measure that is relevant to addressing this pressure (M413-UZ4-03). In addition, Germany reports a number of measures as being relevant for addressing this pressure for seabed habitats; however, it does not specify which activities they will address (M914-other, M916-other, M918-other, M923-other). 


At the subregional level, in the North Sea most Member States identified marine-based renewable energy, urban and solid waste disposal activities as relevant for causing physical loss and fisheries, marine mining and shipping as relevant for causing shipping. In the Baltic Sea, most Member States reported marine-based renewable energy to cause physical loss and fisheries to cause physical damage. Most of these activities have been identified by Germany and are addressed by its measures. Nevertheless, unlike neighbouring Member States, land claim and coastal defence were not reported by Germany under Article 8 and no measures have been reported to address this activity. 

On a regional level, Germany refers to OSPAR, HELCOM, and the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation for its seabed habitats’ PoM. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessement  
Water column habitats: Even though no specific water column habitat measure have been reported, spatial protection measures and measures aiming at improving seabed habitat condition and reduce waste water runoff will contribute to a reduction of pressures on water column habitats. Furthermore, measures reported under D2, D5 and D8 will contribute to a reduction of important pressures for this habitat. Nevertheless, Germany does not clearly identify how these measures will address relevant pressures on this habitat. Hence, the measures partially address the pressures on these habitats. 

Seabed habitats: The reported groups of measures address physical loss and damage pressures from fishing activities, in addition to habitat loss. However, the PoM does not provide information on how a number of activities causing these pressures are addressed, although they were reported under Article 8 (such as marine hydrocarbon extraction, marine-based renewable energy generation, solid waste disposal). Therefore, pressures are partially covered.";2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details
DE ;ATL ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessement  
The GES definitions that are relevant for water column habitats refer to achieving good ecological status and good chemical status according to the WFD for coastal and territorial waters respectively. The Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQO) of OSPAR and HELCOM BSAP are also relevant. Overall, Germany does not report specific water column habitats measures in its PoM, but does link its bird, fish, mammals and seabed measures to water column habitats. Germany does not explicitly report which measures from other descriptor address chemical status specifically for water column habitats, but it is likely that measures improving the conditions of seabed habitats, in addition to WFD measures and spatial protection measures will have positive effects on water column habitats. Therefore, the German PoM will partially support the achievement of GES. 

No target refers to water column habitats specifically; therefore, assessment towards targets cannot be made for water column habitats.

The Directives and international agreements relevant for seabed habitats are the Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan, and Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQO) of OSPAR and HELCOM BSAP. Germany refers to all of these Directives and agreements in its PoM; in this way, it will likely contribute to the achievement of the GES. However, the PoM does not include measures that aim to protect seabed habitats from destructive offshore activities, apart from noise input or in MPAs; thus, it is not clear if the PoM will be sufficient to achieving a sustainable conservation status for seabed habitats. The PoM also mentions one species specifically (lobster Homarus gammarus). Nevertheless, Germany reports that they include the protection of seabed habitats, as listed under the Habitats Directive and the OSPAR and – where ecologically relevant - HELCOM habitats listed for protection, in its regulations for MPAs. Therefore, it is likely that the relevant species will be addressed by the PoM. Overall, the measures partially address the GES for seabed habitats (D1,4,6).

All four targets are relevant for seabed habitats in German waters. Target 1 is likely to be addressed, given that the PoM covers MPA implementation measures, including fisheries restrictions in MPAs, which can contribute to an improvement of seabed habitat condition. By-catch and destruction of seabed habitats will also be addressed by the PoM, as required by target 2, firstly through the fisheries restriction measures in MPAs and secondly, through a fisheries management measure, aimed at reducing the impact of fishing gears on seabed habitats. Target 3 is not fully addressed, given that the PoM covers the mentioned species lobster (Homarus gammarus), and Germany foresees no resettlement measure for the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) as required by the target. This represents a clear gap. The impact of man-made structures on seabed habitats is also addressed by the measures regarding underwater noise. However, underwater noise does not represent a major issue for marine invertebrates, compared to underwater constructions, which are mostly responsible for pressures resulting from the placement and maintenance of offshore structures. This aspect is likely not to be covered by the German PoM, thus the measures are partially addressing the targets for seabed habitats (D1,4,6). ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessement

Seabed habitats: The measures link to all relevant policies (Habitats Directive, the Wadden Sea Plan, EcoQO of OSPAR, HELCOM BSAP) as defined by the GES. Moreover, they address the benthic habitats targets by implementing MPAs with restricted fishing activities and reduce seabed destruction through fisheries measures. Also, a measure on the resettlement of the lobster (Homarus gammarus) has been reported. However, no resettlement measure for the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) has been reported, which represents a gap.

DK ;ATL ;13;D1-B;Coverage of pressures;"Denmark reports spatial protection schemes as the main element addressing pressures on seabirds. These MPAs include several areas designated according to the presence of specific bird species protected by the PoM. This will help to address general pressures on seabirds, although the measure does not provide much detail on the activities covered within these protected areas. Fishing is directly covered by specific regulations within Natura 2000 areas. Denmark also makes links in its PoM to existing measures against oil pollution defined under D8.

Measures addressing other relevant pressures, such as marine litter or broader fisheries impacts (beyond MPAs), are reported for other biodiversity elements, such as mammals, or descriptors, which could also benefit birds. However, these links were not provided by Denmark and are not considered within this assessment. 

Overall, pressures on seabirds are partially addressed by the reported measures. 

At a regional level, Denmark links its PoM to coordination and cooperation actions within HELCOM and OSPAR.  ";Pressures for birds are partially addressed. Spatial protection measures are mainly provided. However, some measures focus specifically on several bird species.

DK ;ATL ;13;D1-B;Coverage of GES and targets;"Denmark defined a general GES for biodiversity, with no specific mention of seabirds or any other species. The aim is the general maintenance of the health of species’ populations, their distribution and structure, as well as their ecological functions (including a mention of key predators, which likely includes seabirds). 

Similar to the GES, Denmark set as its targets the maintenance of distribution ranges per region and the wintering populations (linked to food availability). Here, it refers to several species, including the long-tailed duck, divers, common scoter and common eider. A non-species-related target is the development of more protected areas, to create a coherent network representing biodiversity throughout Danish waters.

While the PoM addresses the maintenance of populations and their distribution through the existing species-specific protected areas, the lack of protection beyond these areas and the failure to identify further potential impacts may jeopardise the achievement of some of the elements included in the GES and targets definitions.

Denmark reports a research measure on further understanding the impact of bycatch on seabirds in several regions and on the necessity of developing further fisheries restrictions, which may lead to more efficient measures tackling this pressure and thus reduce its impacts. It should still be noted that this measure has a limited scope as it is based on a research project that focuses on a specific area.

Denmark also conducts a study on the effect of climate change on the long-tailed duck, as described in the section on ‘Gaps, justifications and timeline’ below. The project will provide important information regarding the Danish population of long-tailed duck in general.

Therefore, the PoM only partially addresses GES and targets.";measures partially address GES and targets since they cover, through SPAs, the habitats for the key species identified in the targets.

DK ;ATL ;13;D1-F;Coverage of pressures;"Denmark addresses impacts on some fish habitats and populations (especially at offshore reef areas), but also the direct effects of the extraction of species, in several measures, providing spatial protection to certain sensitive fish habitats and covering fisheries’ impacts more generally. These measures will lower fishing pressure and might also reduce the potential bycatch of non-commercial species (although not clearly stated by Denmark). It is however not clear whether or not fish species, such as anadromous fish and fish (e.g. elasmobranchs) associated with the seabed, which occur outside of these reef areas are also covered by the measures. The destruction of seabed habitats by dredging activities, especially regarding reefs, is also addressed by the PoM, protecting these habitats and improving their fish nursery function. Nutrient enrichment is addressed by a measure focusing on its impact on plankton and copepods populations, thereby protecting these organisms, which play a key role in fish diet.

Measures addressing other relevant pressures such as contaminants and marine litter, which were reported for other descriptors or biodiversity elements, such as mammals, were not, however, linked to fish by Denmark and are not considered within this assessment. 

Overall, the PoM partially addresses pressures on fish.

At a regional level, Denmark links its PoM to coordination and cooperation actions within HELCOM and OSPAR.  ";the pressures are partially addressed, as the extraction of species by fisheries and general impacts on certain fish habitats (especially offshore reef areas) in MPAs, physical loss of reefs functioning as nurseries, and nutrient enrichment (affecting plankton and copepods, the main food sources for fish) are covered.

DK ;ATL ;13;D1-F;Coverage of GES and targets;"Denmark defined GES for fish in a broad and general manner, without mentioning any species or fish group. The GES definition considered the maintenance of the health of species’ populations, their distribution, ecosystem structure, and ecological functions. All of these elements are partly covered by the existing broad network of protected areas, which will help to directly protect these species, but also by the measure on protecting fish food sources. Still, since the measures seem to specifically focus on some fish habitats and populations (i.e. at offshore reef areas), it is not clear whether or not all fish species, including endangered species living outside MPAs and these reefs areas, will be covered.

Fish are directly mentioned in two targets. Target 50 focuses on the habitat level, aiming to prevent impacts from sediment extraction in areas important for sand eel. Extraction activities are covered by a measure specifically addressing these activities (M025), although the link to these habitats was only made within a measure reported for seabed habitats. Target 17 covers food webs, focusing on the maintenance or increase of the average length of fish at the top of the food chain, using cod and saithe as indicator species. While these species are not directly mentioned by the PoM, measure M031 aims to lower fishing pressure towards achieving MSY, which should increase the share of adult individuals (larger size) of these populations since they are the main commercial species in the area. This measure has also been specifically linked to this target. 

The existing measures have been linked to D3, reinforcing the coverage of commercial fisheries. Still, the PoM does not mention any species listed in the Habitats Directive, or by OSPAR and HELCOM.

DK ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Denmark addresses eutrophication from nutrient input, focusing on its impact on water column habitats but not detailing the activities covered. This measure links to D5, thus pressures on water column habitats are considered to be addressed, as the measures reported for D5 actually cover the nutrient enrichment pressure on these habitats. Denmark also addresses contaminants from offshore hydrocarbon extraction platforms (Denmark also makes links in its PoM between food webs and contaminant-related measures (D8)) and coastal activities such as ports and dredging.

Other pressures relevant for water column habitats, such as NIS introductions and micro-litter, are neither mentioned nor addressed by the PoM. Some further information specifying which activities causing nutrient input are covered by the measures would also help to clarify the PoM’s suitability.

Given these gaps, pressures on water column habitats are partially addressed by the PoM.

In its Article 8 reporting, Denmark identified physical loss and damage as pressures for seabed integrity. It reported that marine-based renewable energy generation, hydrocarbon extraction (only in the North Sea), land claim and solid waste disposal (of dredged material, only in the North Sea) were activities causing physical loss. Fisheries, marine mining and shipping were identified as sources of physical damage. Submarine cable and pipeline operations were identified as causes of both physical loss and damage. 

All of these activities, except shipping, are directly addressed by the reported measures. Marine-based renewable energy generation as a source of physical loss is only partially covered by the measure focusing on artificial reefs, because this measure only aims at compensating some of the effects of energy structures at the end of their lifespan. The measures provide specific spatial protection to prevent impacts on seabed habitats from several activities, direct technical restrictions on gear (as for bottom-trawl fishing) in some specific areas (Natura 2000 areas), and management measures regarding area usage. Denmark further explains, during the review process of this technical assessment, that new MSFD MPAs have been designated and implementation of fisheries regulation are underway under CFP guidelines. This will include protection of the deep sediment seabed habitats in Kattegat (M003).
Shipping is not covered by the reported measures. Measures addressing fisheries and bottom trawling, although planned to be expanded, are applied only in specific habitats within MPAs). 

Denmark covers other activities in addition to those identified in its Article 8 report through its measures, such as port operations and dredging. 

At the (sub)regional level, physical loss and damage were identified as relevant by all Member States in the Baltic and North Seas. In the North Sea, most of the neighbouring Member States report fisheries, marine mining and shipping as the main activities identified causing physical damage, while in the Baltic Sea, fisheries are particularly highlighted. Denmark tackled most of these activities, except shipping.

In terms of physical loss, the Member States in the North Sea mainly report land claim and coastal defence, solid waste disposal and marine renewable energy generation, while in the Baltic Sea, marine renewable energy is specifically reported. These activities are addressed by Denmark.

Overall, Denmark partially addresses the relevant pressures on seabed habitats and the activities reported in Article 8.

At the regional level, Denmark links its PoM with OSPAR (for the North Sea) and HELCOM (for the Baltic Sea). ";"Water column habitats: pressures are partially addressed. Nutrient enrichment is directly addressed although the covered activities are not mentioned. Hydrological changes and hydrocarbon extraction activities are also covered. However, pressures such as NIS introductions and micro-litter are not addressed by the water column-related measures (links to D2 and D10 have not been made).

Seabed habitats: pressures are partially addressed since physical loss or damage from submarine cable and pipeline operations, hydrocarbon extraction, land claim and coastal defence, port operations, solid waste disposal, fisheries and dredging are covered by the PoM. While identified as relevant in the Article 8 report, shipping is not covered by the reported measures, and marine-based renewable energy generation is only partially covered by the measure focusing on artificial reefs (that only aims at compensating some of the effects of energy structures at the end of their lifespan).";2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/88b3669e-7f69-4ddc-a0f4-f62187d3d1bc/details
DK ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Denmark did not define GES for water column habitats.

Plankton and copepods are directly mentioned as a key part of water column habitats. Denmark reports four targets for water column habitats. Target 18 covers the maintenance of the long-term average values in copepod and mesozooplankton communities. Targets 19 and 34 cover the maintenance of phytoplankton concentration (measured as chlorophyll-a) and water transparency levels according to the WFD standards. Target 21 covers the algal composition of plankton, aiming to avoid the development of toxic cyanobacteria as a result of human-induced eutrophication. These targets are directly addressed by the existing measure which itself addresses eutrophication and links to the D5 measures. This must ensure the maintenance of human impacts below a threshold likely to disrupt these communities and thereby alter the naturally occurring levels of physical, chemical and biological indicators. Given that both pressures for D5 and targets defined for D5 that are similar to those reported for water column habitats are considered to be addressed, and that water column habitats rely to a large extent on D5, the targets are considered covered.

Denmark defined GES for seabed habitats as the prevention of impacts likely to cause irreversible damage or threaten the integrity of seabed habitats. The GES also establishes that the ecological function, biological diversity and species abundance in these habitats must demonstrate natural levels of diversity and productivity. The reported measures address these elements from several angles, providing preventative protection by means of MPAs but also by tackling several activities identified as potentially affecting seabed habitats, thus creating a framework for the maintenance of seabed habitat functions and productivity. However, the scope of these measures seems limited: only some habitats types, especially in MPAs, are covered by the measures. However, Denmark supplements the Natura 2000 protection with a protection of some deep sediment seabed habitats in new MSFD MPAs. Sea-floor disturbance will be regulated through prohibiting dredging and bottom trawling within these sites. Still, the measures cannot fully ensure the integrity of all seabed habitats, as specified in the GES definition, which is thus only partially addressed.

Targets 4 and 11 cover the maintenance of species composition of macroalgae habitats in the stone reefs of the Kattegat, the Danish straits and the Bornholm areas. Macroalgae are also addressed by targets 20 and 22, aiming to maintain their density in all non-coastal waters according to the levels established by the WFD for coastal waters (which at first sight seems contradictory, since coastal and open sea seabed habitats face completely different environmental conditions). These specific areas are mentioned in the measures to develop spatial protection, therefore preventing impacts on these habitats (M021 and M026) and working towards the achievement of the targets. Target 9 aims to maintain the occurrence of horse mussel beds in the Kattegat and the Danish straits, while target 48 covers their mapping in areas of the North Sea. Both elements are also addressed in MPA designation and mapping efforts, such as those developed by measures M001 and M002. Target 50 addresses the mapping of areas relevant for sand eel, with the aim of preventing impacts from dredging activities. This is directly addressed by measure M038. Target 13 aims to build a representative network of MPAs covering Danish marine biodiversity, which is also addressed by several measures reported on widening the current MPA network, such as M021 or M003. Target 26 deals with the development of an index of species vulnerable to physical disturbance, which is directly developed by measure M009.
Targets 24 and 25 aim to maintain the occurrence and number of species sensitive to physical disturbance on soft-bottom habitats. Target 10 addresses species of soft-bottom habitats more generally, aiming to maintain or improve their composition and distribution. These targets reflect different aspects of soft-sediment habitats. Most of the measures mainly concern hard-bottom habitats, except M003 that addresses some deep sediment seabed habitats and protects these habitats, especially from bottom trawling, in these additional MPA areas. Target 36 aims to maintain or decrease current levels of anthropogenic impacts on the seabed. Most activities identified as relevant are addressed by the measures, especially those affecting remarkable habitats and protected by MPAs. Still, some relevant activities are either only partially covered or not covered by the measures. 
Target 35 covers oxygen concentration at the benthic level on the Kattegat area. No measure clearly addresses activities likely to deplete oxygen levels, such as those introducing nutrients and triggering eutrophication. The oxygen is generally measured in the water column near the seabed as this is where it becomes depleted due to organic enrichment. There is rarely measurement of the oxygen in the sediment itself. In this sense, and since links to D5 are reported by Denmark for water column habitats, seabed habitats are also linked to D5. Therefore, this target can be considered addressed as well.

In general, the high level of detail reported for the targets, compared to the vague description of many of the measures, makes it difficult to assess whether or not the targets are fully addressed, given the scarce information available. Denmark addresses several potential impacts that may jeopardise the achievement of GES and targets for seabed habitats, including species-specific measures for some sensitive seabed inhabitants. Still, the scope of the measures is rather limited as explained above. As such, GES and targets are considered partially addressed by the reported measures.";"Water column habitats: GES was not defined and targets are addressed. The measures address eutrophication and provide a link to D5 measures that cover all impacts likely to alter the composition of water column habitats, maintaining the average values in the abundance and composition of phytoplankton populations, as well as their ecological functions. 

Seabed habitats: GES and targets are partially addressed. The measures provide a framework to protect the elements identified in the GES definition, such as ecosystem function and biological diversity, mainly via MPAs and by tackling several activities affecting seabed habitats. However, these measures have a limited scope: only some habitats types, especially in MPAs, are covered by the measures. Therefore, the measures cannot fully ensure the integrity of all seabed habitats, as specified in the GES definition.

Denmark addresses impacts on some fish habitats and populations (especially at offshore reef areas), but also the direct effects of the extraction of species, in several measures, providing spatial protection to certain sensitive fish habitats and covering fisheries’ impacts more generally. These measures will lower fishing pressure and might also reduce the potential bycatch of non-commercial species (although not clearly stated by Denmark). It is however not clear whether or not fish species, such as anadromous fish and fish (e.g. elasmobranchs) associated with the seabed, which occur outside of these reef areas are also covered by the measures. The destruction of seabed habitats by dredging activities, especially regarding reefs, is also addressed by the PoM, protecting these habitats and improving their fish nursery function. Nutrient enrichment is addressed by a measure focusing on its impact on plankton and copepods populations, thereby protecting these organisms, which play a key role in fish diet.

Measures addressing other relevant pressures such as contaminants and marine litter, which were reported for other descriptors or biodiversity elements, such as mammals, were not, however, linked to fish by Denmark and are not considered within this assessment.

DK ;ATL ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Denmark defined GES for fish in a broad and general manner, without mentioning any species or fish group. The GES definition considered the maintenance of the health of species’ populations, their distribution, ecosystem structure, and ecological functions. All of these elements are partly covered by the existing broad network of protected areas, which will help to directly protect these species, but also by the measure on protecting fish food sources. Still, since the measures seem to specifically focus on some fish habitats and populations (i.e. at offshore reef areas), it is not clear whether or not all fish species, including endangered species living outside MPAs and these reefs areas, will be covered.

Fish are directly mentioned in two targets. Target 50 focuses on the habitat level, aiming to prevent impacts from sediment extraction in areas important for sand eel. Extraction activities are covered by a measure specifically addressing these activities (M025), although the link to these habitats was only made within a measure reported for seabed habitats. Target 17 covers food webs, focusing on the maintenance or increase of the average length of fish at the top of the food chain, using cod and saithe as indicator species. While these species are not directly mentioned by the PoM, measure M031 aims to lower fishing pressure towards achieving MSY, which should increase the share of adult individuals (larger size) of these populations since they are the main commercial species in the area. This measure has also been specifically linked to this target. 

The existing measures have been linked to D3, reinforcing the coverage of commercial fisheries. Still, the PoM does not mention any species listed in the Habitats Directive, or by OSPAR and HELCOM.

Overall, the PoM partially addresses GES and targets.

Denmark defined GES for mammals by means of a set of conditions for the harbour porpoise, such as maintaining their population, distribution range, genetic variation and reproductive capacity, thus ensuring their long-term viability. The maintenance of the distribution ranges is assured by the spatial protection network existing in Danish waters, which would have the added benefit of directly improving the other elements comprised in the GES definition. Seals are not directly mentioned in the GES definition, although they are directly addressed by the measures.

As for GES, species-specific spatial protection measures will also work towards the general achievement of targets. Activities likely to have an impact on their populations are required to undergo an EIA before their implementation. Still, bycatch from fisheries is partly addressed by monitoring efforts as well as the design of a protection strategy for harbour porpoise, which should include any necessary regulation of fisheries, if deemed an issue with regards to bycatch. As such, the measures do not fully address the target on bycatch that aims at minimising or even reducing it (to an acceptable level – below 1.7% of the total size of the population).

This assessment assumed that this also applied to D1, 4, 6. Denmark did not define GES for water column habitats.

Timeline for implementation of the PoM
Denmark report timelines for the implementation of its new measures. Four of them started to be implemented before 2016 (2013-2021 for M010, 2015 for M001 and 2015-2017 for M002 and M011) and four other measures started to be implemented with a slight delay (2017 for M003 and M005, 2017-2018 for M004, and 2017-2019 for M009). However, M012 will be implemented only by 2019. ";Denmark reports that the PoM aims to achieve GES by 2020 (it should still be noted that GES has not been defined for water column habitats).

DK ;ATL ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Denmark addresses eutrophication from nutrient input, focusing on its impact on water column habitats but not detailing the activities covered. This measure links to D5, thus pressures on water column habitats are considered to be addressed, as the measures reported for D5 actually cover the nutrient enrichment pressure on these habitats. Denmark also addresses contaminants from offshore hydrocarbon extraction platforms (Denmark also makes links in its PoM between food webs and contaminant-related measures (D8)) and coastal activities such as ports and dredging.

Other pressures relevant for water column habitats, such as NIS introductions and micro-litter, are neither mentioned nor addressed by the PoM. Some further information specifying which activities causing nutrient input are covered by the measures would also help to clarify the PoM’s suitability.

Given these gaps, pressures on water column habitats are partially addressed by the PoM.

In its Article 8 reporting, Denmark identified physical loss and damage as pressures for seabed integrity. It reported that marine-based renewable energy generation, hydrocarbon extraction (only in the North Sea), land claim and solid waste disposal (of dredged material, only in the North Sea) were activities causing physical loss. Fisheries, marine mining and shipping were identified as sources of physical damage. Submarine cable and pipeline operations were identified as causes of both physical loss and damage. 

All of these activities, except shipping, are directly addressed by the reported measures. Marine-based renewable energy generation as a source of physical loss is only partially covered by the measure focusing on artificial reefs, because this measure only aims at compensating some of the effects of energy structures at the end of their lifespan. The measures provide specific spatial protection to prevent impacts on seabed habitats from several activities, direct technical restrictions on gear (as for bottom-trawl fishing) in some specific areas (Natura 2000 areas), and management measures regarding area usage. Denmark further explains, during the review process of this technical assessment, that new MSFD MPAs have been designated and implementation of fisheries regulation are underway under CFP guidelines. This will include protection of the deep sediment seabed habitats in Kattegat (M003).
Shipping is not covered by the reported measures. Measures addressing fisheries and bottom trawling, although planned to be expanded, are applied only in specific habitats within MPAs). 

Denmark covers other activities in addition to those identified in its Article 8 report through its measures, such as port operations and dredging. 

At the (sub)regional level, physical loss and damage were identified as relevant by all Member States in the Baltic and North Seas. In the North Sea, most of the neighbouring Member States report fisheries, marine mining and shipping as the main activities identified causing physical damage, while in the Baltic Sea, fisheries are particularly highlighted. Denmark tackled most of these activities, except shipping.

In terms of physical loss, the Member States in the North Sea mainly report land claim and coastal defence, solid waste disposal and marine renewable energy generation, while in the Baltic Sea, marine renewable energy is specifically reported. These activities are addressed by Denmark.

Overall, Denmark partially addresses the relevant pressures on seabed habitats and the activities reported in Article 8.

At the regional level, Denmark links its PoM with OSPAR (for the North Sea) and HELCOM (for the Baltic Sea). ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessement 
Water column habitats: pressures are partially addressed. Nutrient enrichment is directly addressed although the covered activities are not mentioned. Hydrological changes and hydrocarbon extraction activities are also covered. However, pressures such as NIS introductions and micro-litter are not addressed by the water column-related measures (links to D2 and D10 have not been made).

Seabed habitats: pressures are partially addressed since physical loss or damage from submarine cable and pipeline operations, hydrocarbon extraction, land claim and coastal defence, port operations, solid waste disposal, fisheries and dredging are covered by the PoM. While identified as relevant in the Article 8 report, shipping is not covered by the reported measures, and marine-based renewable energy generation is only partially covered by the measure focusing on artificial reefs (that only aims at compensating some of the effects of energy structures at the end of their lifespan).";2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/88b3669e-7f69-4ddc-a0f4-f62187d3d1bc/details
DK ;ATL ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Denmark did not define GES for water column habitats.

Plankton and copepods are directly mentioned as a key part of water column habitats. Denmark reports four targets for water column habitats. Target 18 covers the maintenance of the long-term average values in copepod and mesozooplankton communities. Targets 19 and 34 cover the maintenance of phytoplankton concentration (measured as chlorophyll-a) and water transparency levels according to the WFD standards. Target 21 covers the algal composition of plankton, aiming to avoid the development of toxic cyanobacteria as a result of human-induced eutrophication. These targets are directly addressed by the existing measure which itself addresses eutrophication and links to the D5 measures. This must ensure the maintenance of human impacts below a threshold likely to disrupt these communities and thereby alter the naturally occurring levels of physical, chemical and biological indicators. Given that both pressures for D5 and targets defined for D5 that are similar to those reported for water column habitats are considered to be addressed, and that water column habitats rely to a large extent on D5, the targets are considered covered.

Denmark defined GES for seabed habitats as the prevention of impacts likely to cause irreversible damage or threaten the integrity of seabed habitats. The GES also establishes that the ecological function, biological diversity and species abundance in these habitats must demonstrate natural levels of diversity and productivity. The reported measures address these elements from several angles, providing preventative protection by means of MPAs but also by tackling several activities identified as potentially affecting seabed habitats, thus creating a framework for the maintenance of seabed habitat functions and productivity. However, the scope of these measures seems limited: only some habitats types, especially in MPAs, are covered by the measures. However, Denmark supplements the Natura 2000 protection with a protection of some deep sediment seabed habitats in new MSFD MPAs. Sea-floor disturbance will be regulated through prohibiting dredging and bottom trawling within these sites. Still, the measures cannot fully ensure the integrity of all seabed habitats, as specified in the GES definition, which is thus only partially addressed.

Targets 4 and 11 cover the maintenance of species composition of macroalgae habitats in the stone reefs of the Kattegat, the Danish straits and the Bornholm areas. Macroalgae are also addressed by targets 20 and 22, aiming to maintain their density in all non-coastal waters according to the levels established by the WFD for coastal waters (which at first sight seems contradictory, since coastal and open sea seabed habitats face completely different environmental conditions). These specific areas are mentioned in the measures to develop spatial protection, therefore preventing impacts on these habitats (M021 and M026) and working towards the achievement of the targets. Target 9 aims to maintain the occurrence of horse mussel beds in the Kattegat and the Danish straits, while target 48 covers their mapping in areas of the North Sea. Both elements are also addressed in MPA designation and mapping efforts, such as those developed by measures M001 and M002. Target 50 addresses the mapping of areas relevant for sand eel, with the aim of preventing impacts from dredging activities. This is directly addressed by measure M038. Target 13 aims to build a representative network of MPAs covering Danish marine biodiversity, which is also addressed by several measures reported on widening the current MPA network, such as M021 or M003. Target 26 deals with the development of an index of species vulnerable to physical disturbance, which is directly developed by measure M009.
Targets 24 and 25 aim to maintain the occurrence and number of species sensitive to physical disturbance on soft-bottom habitats. Target 10 addresses species of soft-bottom habitats more generally, aiming to maintain or improve their composition and distribution. These targets reflect different aspects of soft-sediment habitats. Most of the measures mainly concern hard-bottom habitats, except M003 that addresses some deep sediment seabed habitats and protects these habitats, especially from bottom trawling, in these additional MPA areas. Target 36 aims to maintain or decrease current levels of anthropogenic impacts on the seabed. Most activities identified as relevant are addressed by the measures, especially those affecting remarkable habitats and protected by MPAs. Still, some relevant activities are either only partially covered or not covered by the measures. 
Target 35 covers oxygen concentration at the benthic level on the Kattegat area. No measure clearly addresses activities likely to deplete oxygen levels, such as those introducing nutrients and triggering eutrophication. The oxygen is generally measured in the water column near the seabed as this is where it becomes depleted due to organic enrichment. There is rarely measurement of the oxygen in the sediment itself. In this sense, and since links to D5 are reported by Denmark for water column habitats, seabed habitats are also linked to D5. Therefore, this target can be considered addressed as well.

In general, the high level of detail reported for the targets, compared to the vague description of many of the measures, makes it difficult to assess whether or not the targets are fully addressed, given the scarce information available. Denmark addresses several potential impacts that may jeopardise the achievement of GES and targets for seabed habitats, including species-specific measures for some sensitive seabed inhabitants. Still, the scope of the measures is rather limited as explained above. As such, GES and targets are considered partially addressed by the reported measures.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: GES was not defined and targets are addressed. The measures address eutrophication and provide a link to D5 measures that cover all impacts likely to alter the composition of water column habitats, maintaining the average values in the abundance and composition of phytoplankton populations, as well as their ecological functions. 

Seabed habitats: GES and targets are partially addressed. The measures provide a framework to protect the elements identified in the GES definition, such as ecosystem function and biological diversity, mainly via MPAs and by tackling several activities affecting seabed habitats. However, these measures have a limited scope: only some habitats types, especially in MPAs, are covered by the measures. Therefore, the measures cannot fully ensure the integrity of all seabed habitats, as specified in the GES definition.

In the 2014 GES update, Estonia included as criteria: ecosystem structure (monitoring catches of: maximum length, abundance of predatory fish and trophic index), productivity of key trophic groups, and salmon and perch smolt abundance. Measures reported by Estonia would partially address these features through spatial protection and fisheries restrictions, however, their impact is limited as these measures are not clearly linked in the PoM to relevant areas for one of these species (salmon), while perch is covered in M005.

Regarding the targets for fish (as defined as part of D1), Estonia aims for undisturbed ecosystems and sustainable ecosystem services, defining indicators such as maximum mean length of fish and an abundance index for predatory fish in surveys (as for GES). Fish are as well included in D4 targets, with the same two references to perch and salmon smolts. However, no thresholds or reference values are provided, hindering the assessment of the progress towards targets. Again, considering the measures reported by Estonia, while a reduction of fishing pressures is expected to happen, bringing a positive impact on the ecosystem, no clear link can be made between the reported measures and one of the targeted species (salmon). 

Therefore, even though the new measures would improve the overall performance regarding all biodiversity-related targets, GES and targets for fish are considered as only partially addressed by the PoM since no specific measures cover salmon.";fish species are covered by spatial protection, aquaculture management and fisheries restrictions measures.

EE;BAL ;14;D1-M;Exceptions;"Estonia applies an exception for mammals (D1, 4). The PoM mentions Article 14 (1) but it does not further explain which point of this Article is used for the D1-related exception. Estonia stated that GES might not be achieved by 2020 in the case of species for which this achievement depends on climatic conditions. The last assessment of climate change for the Baltic Sea shows that the extent of the maximum winter ice cover in the Baltic Sea has significantly decreased and the incidence of exceptionally warm winters is expected to increase in the future. Consequently, in spite of the implementation of the Ringed Seal Protection Action Plan, there is a high probability that the set environmental objective to restore the historic distributional range of the Ringed seal will not be achieved.

EE;BAL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Estonia solely refers to aquaculture as a relevant activity likely to cause impacts on biodiversity in its PoM. In the case of water column habitats, nutrient enrichment and NIS introduction from this activity are directly addressed by a new measure, focusing on the compilation of regional plans for managing these environmental pressures. One general biodiversity measure addresses response capacity for oil spills, addressing also contaminants on water column habitats. 

Nutrient enrichment and contaminants from sources other than aquaculture, such as industry, shipping or agriculture, might be addressed by measures reported for eutrophication (D5) and contaminants (D8); however, this link has not been made by Estonia and therefore cannot be assessed in this section. None of the reported measures address NIS from shipping nor marine litter.

Therefore, the measures partially address pressures on water column habitats. 

In its Article 8 reporting, Estonia identified physical loss and damage as relevant pressures for seabed integrity. It reported that respectively marine-based renewable energy generation (wind, wave and tidal power) and dredging are activities likely to cause impacts on seabed habitats. However, no measure has been defined to specifically cover these activities. Only aquaculture is covered by a new measure (although the specific actions to protect seabed habitats have not been reported by Estonia). 
The PoM also includes general biodiversity measures, providing mostly spatial protection, which could include restriction for damaging activities at least within the territory of the MPAs. However, this cannot be verified considering the information reported by Estonia. None of the reported measures address marine litter.

At the regional level in the Baltic Sea, physical loss and damage are also identified by most Member States in the Baltic Sea (except Poland for both pressures and Latvia for physical damage). A majority of them reported marine-based renewable energy generation and fisheries as the main sources of these pressures. Other activities, such as shipping (Denmark, Finland and Sweden), marine mining (Germany and Denmark), or dredging (Finland, Estonia and Latvia) have been reported by few Member States. It is not clear whether Estonia covers these activities by its measures for seabed habitats.

The HELCOM matrix on human activities and pressures shows that physical loss and damage in the marine environment can be caused by various activities, such as aquaculture, marine-based renewable energy generation, electricity cables, bottom trawling, extraction of oil and gas, physical restructuring of coastline or seabed, tourism and transport infrastructure, solid waste disposal, military operations, shipping, etc. . While the latter represents a non-exhaustive list of the possible sources of physical loss and damage, these have not been prioritised. Estonia does not address most of these activities, although it does make reference to the Helsinki Convention. 

Overall, the measures do not address pressures on seabed habitats.";"Water column habitats: the PoM addresses nutrient enrichment and NIS introduction from aquaculture, as well as contaminants from oil spills.

EE;BAL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Estonia defined GES for water column habitats focusing on seasonal progression of phytoplankton groups, copepods/total mesozooplankton biomass ratio, and community trophic index. In their 2014 GES update, two sets of indicators have been included for water column habitats: species composition, abundance and biomass of zooplankton; and copepod biomass and total biomass of mesozooplankton ratio.
No information is reported regarding the timeline for starting to use these indicators, but in any case, they may serve as a completion of the previously defined GES.

Target 15 focuses on changes in ‘the main trophic groups’ that do not endanger food-web integrity, having as indicator the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups.

GES and the progress made towards the target are partially addressed by the PoM. While tackling aquaculture may reduce the impact on water column habitats, other types of impacts are not specifically addressed by the measures, but may be covered by measures for other descriptors (e.g. D2, D5, D8). 

Estonia included several indicators in its 2012 GES definition, such as the Baltic clam Macoma baltica maximum depth distribution, zoobenthos community index, hard bottom index, and habitat diversity index of phytobenthos. In the 2014 update, GES was further developed through the inclusion of the distributional range and areas of certain species and habitats.

Two targets focus on the disturbance of the seafloor caused by human activity that should not cause significant changes in quality of benthic habitats and in benthic communities. Various indicators are associated to them, such as the extent of the seabed significantly affected by human activities for the different substrate types, maximum depth distribution of the Baltic clam and the zoobenthos community index, among others.

Since only aquaculture is directly addressed by the PoM, while the rest of the pressures should be addressed via spatial protection measures, the achievement or maintenance of GES for the selected indicators would depend on the establishment of the new MPAs and the restrictions applied to activities within them, as well as on other biodiversity measures with a general scope, and measures reported for other descriptors.

EE;BAL ;13;D4;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Estonia only identified aquaculture as an activity likely to cause impacts on fish, being specifically addressed by a new measure that aims to reduce eutrophication and NIS introduction from this activity.

The extraction of species is covered by spatial protection measures (it is not specified whether fishing will be restricted within the MPAs) as well as fishing restrictions and size limits of commercial fish (which should address by-catch related pressures, although it is not clearly stated by Estonia). One general biodiversity measure addresses response capacity for oil spills, potentially addressing also contaminants on fish, while another new measure focuses on aquaculture which should reduce NIS- and eutrophication-related impacts. This should have positive consequences on fish. None of the reported measures address marine litter.

Pressures on fish should be covered by the general measures on all biodiversity groups (several pieces of EU legislation and international conventions). Still, the PoM does not provide any information regarding which pressures and activities will be addressed by the implementation of these measures and how they will be addressed.

Therefore, the pressures on fish are partially addressed by the PoM.

At regional level, Estonia links its measures targeting fish to the Helsinki Convention and to the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region.

Marine mammals are addressed in the PoM by two action plans focusing on the two seal species present in Estonia's marine waters: the ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). However, the PoM provides no detail on which pressures may be addressed by these plans. It is likely that these species will also benefit from the development of the MPAs network, which will probably reduce general anthropogenic pressures (although none can be identified from the content of the spatial protection measures). One general biodiversity measure addresses response capacity for oil spills, addressing also contaminants on marine mammals. However, it is not clear whether by-catch is covered by the measures reported for mammals. The pressures associated to marine litter do not seem to be addressed by the measures targeting mammals.

Therefore, the measures partially address relevant pressures on marine mammals (species-specific measures have been reported for seals, but further information would be needed to assess the uncertainties left by the reported measures).

At a regional level, Estonia links its PoM to the Helsinki Convention and to the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 

Fish: pressures on fish are partially addressed. Aquaculture is covered, reducing pressures from NIS introduction and nutrients enrichment. The extraction of species is covered by spatial protection measures (it is not specified whether fishing will be restricted within the MPAs) as well as fishing restrictions and size limits of commercial fish (which should address by-catch related pressures, although it is not clearly stated by Estonia).

Mammals: pressures on mammals are partially addressed. The PoM does not disclose any specific activity impacting mammals and mainly provides spatial protection and two species-specific management plans. It is likely that some pressures on these species are addressed, also regarding the potential restriction of activities that usually accompanies the declaration of MPAs and the species-specific management plans. Contaminants from oil spills are addressed by a measure on improving capacity reaction in case of accidents.

EE;BAL ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Estonia included in its 2012 GES for fish, some characteristics of the populations of salmon and perch smolts as indicators for the status of food webs (D4). In the 2014 GES update, Estonia included as criteria: ecosystem structure (monitoring catches of: maximum length, abundance of predatory fish and trophic index), productivity of key trophic groups, and salmon and perch smolt abundance. Measures reported by Estonia would partially address these features through spatial protection and fisheries restrictions, however, their impact is limited as these measures are not clearly linked in the PoM to relevant areas for one of these species (salmon), while perch is covered in M005.

Regarding the targets for fish (as defined as part of D1), Estonia aims for undisturbed ecosystems and sustainable ecosystem services, defining indicators such as maximum mean length of fish and an abundance index for predatory fish in surveys (as for GES). Fish are as well included in D4 targets, with the same two references to perch and salmon smolts. However, no thresholds or reference values are provided, hindering the assessment of the progress towards targets. Again, considering the measures reported by Estonia, while a reduction of fishing pressures is expected to happen, bringing a positive impact on the ecosystem, no clear link can be made between the reported measures and one of the targeted species (salmon). 

Therefore, even though the new measures would improve the overall performance regarding all biodiversity-related targets, GES and targets for fish are considered as only partially addressed by the PoM since no specific measures cover salmon.

Estonia defined GES in 2012 for marine mammals, focusing on two seal species: the ringed seal and the grey seal, and more specifically their abundance and distributional patterns. In 2014, the GES definition was updated to also include the productivity of the species by monitoring the development of the grey seal reproduction rate (it is however mentioned that this indicator is not yet operational but rather a foreseen future development).

The PoM provides seal-specific action plans and an MPAs network, which are likely to cover some of the reported GES features.

Targets were also defined for the same two species, considering the maintenance of their natural distributional areas and abundances. As for GES, measures reported by Estonia address these two species directly, being likely to work towards the achievement of the targets.

Therefore, GES and targets for marine mammals are considered as addressed by the PoM.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 

Fish: fish species are covered by spatial protection, aquaculture management and fisheries restrictions measures.

EL ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"In its measures reported for biodiversity, and more specifically for water column habitats, Greece does not identify any specific pressure on water column habitats. It does mention fishing and aquaculture as general activities likely to have an impact on the biodiversity groups as a whole. Water column habitats are only mentioned in a measure focusing on monitoring coastal waters, not providing any actual reduction on the pressures nor working towards the improvement of water quality in water column habitats. 

As for the rest of the species and habitats groups, spatial protection measures may indirectly help to reduce pressures on water column habitats, although the extent of their impact is limited to MPAs. 

It is possible that measures reported under other descriptors will, in practice, tackle other pressures likely to have an impact on water column habitats, but this cannot be confirmed by the information provided. 

Based on these considerations, the pressures on water column habitats are considered as not addressed.

In its Article 8 reporting, Greece identified physical loss and damage as relevant pressures for seabed integrity. It reported that marine mining, land claim and coastal defence, and submarine cables and pipelines, as well as tourism and recreation, cause physical loss, while fisheries (including recreational fishing), dredging, aquaculture, agriculture and forestry, industry and urban activities (mainly due to waste water discharge) cause physical damage. It should however be noted that these land-based sources of waste discharges (agriculture, industry and urban activities) are also relevant sources of contaminant and nutrient enrichment-related pressures that have an impact on seabed habitats.

The reported measures are mainly spatial protection and monitoring/mapping efforts. Greece does not report any plans or management measures to reduce the impacts of activities in areas beyond those protected (natural parks and Natura 2000 sites, mainly). Impacts from land-based activities such as industry, agriculture or urban areas are mostly due to run-off or emissions. MPAs are therefore not a solution for managing their potential impacts on seabed habitats. These pressures might be tackled by the measures reported under other descriptors, but Greece does not provide any link to how these measures would benefit seabed habitat. Still, fisheries are covered by the measures and specific seabed habitats are protected within MPAs. The PoM thus partially addresses these pressures.

At the subregional level (Adriatic Sea, Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea and Aegean-Levantine Sea), it is worth mentioning that Greece includes tourism and recreation (including yachting) as a relevant activity causing impacts (physical loss or damage) on seabed habitats. Only Slovenia and Malta similarly reported this activity in the subregion. 
In all subregions, a majority of Member States reported land claim/coastal defence, as well as submarine cable and pipeline operations, as relevant pressures likely to cause physical loss. Greece might address both of these, as explained above. But considering the information provided, this cannot be guaranteed.

Regarding relevant activities likely to cause physical damage, all of the Member States in the region, except Cyprus, highlight the problem of fisheries. Dredging, industry and urban activities are only considered by Greece and Malta. 
Port operations are identified as relevant activities (especially for physical loss) by every Member State in the region, except Greece. Given that Greece holds the port of Piraeus, one of the busiest in Europe, it is likely that port operations also have an impact on seabed habitats in Greece even though it is not included in the PoM.  

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives concerns seafloor integrity: ‘Sea‐floor integrity is maintained, especially in priority benthic habitats (with associated operational objectives and indicators). The Plan Bleu Regional Activity Centre (one of six UNEP/MAP’s Regional Advisory Committees, RACs) explains that, despite efforts, the Mediterranean Sea still faces several pressures, among which are the fishing methods destroying or disturbing the seafloor. Greece addresses the impacts on seabed habitats from fishing, dredging and submarine cables largely only through spatial protection measures. 

Overall, the reported measures only partially address the pressures relevant for seabed habitats.";"Water column habitats: Pressures for water column habitats are not addressed. The reported measure specifically addressing water column habitats is limited to monitoring efforts in coastal locations. Spatial protection measures may indirectly help to lower general pressures on these habitats, although their effect will be limited to MPAs. 

Seabed habitats: The measures partially address the relevant pressures. Physical loss and damage from activities such as fisheries, dredging, submarine cables and pipelines, and tourism were identified as relevant by Greece. The reported measures only directly address fisheries, not any other pressure or activity. The measures are strictly spatial protection measures; thus, they may restrict activities in MPAs but not in the Greek marine waters as a whole. Activities beyond fisheries, especially land-based activities, might be covered by measures reported under other descriptors. However, no such link is clearly made.

EL ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Greece defined GES for water column habitats as the maintenance of the planktonic communities in compliance with the environmental quality criteria. Phytoplankton is assessed as part of the existing measures under the WFD, through the monitoring of qualitative biological figures. 
The reported measure specifically addressing water column habitats focuses on monitoring and is limited to coastal locations. Spatial protection measures will collaborate to protect planktonic communities from sea-based impacts, although only in MPAs. No further information is provided in relation to measures addressing other impacts on the water column.

Greece defined targets that aim to preserve the structure of the benthic macro-fauna and plankton communities. The measures reported would help in monitoring these indicators on coastal locations and lowering pressures in MPAs, despite their limited effects in terms of activities and spatial scope covered.
The reported measures thus do not address GES nor targets for water column habitats since they only concern spatial protection and monitoring efforts, not directly tackling any impacts on these habitats.

Greece defined GES for seabed habitats as ‘the preservation of benthic ecosystems in a sufficient size and health to perform their natural functions, while keeping the number of opportunistic species within the boundaries of acceptable ecological quality’.

At least seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) and maerl beds are considered covered within the measures reported by Greece, via trawling restrictions.

For its targets, Greece aims to preserve the structure of the composition of benthic macro-fauna, monitor the proportion of resistant/opportunistic species within this group, and address the knowledge gaps in the distribution and location of these habitats. This aim is addressed by efforts on improving the mapping of these habitats. 

Overall, the measures on restricting trawling on seagrass and maerl beds will prevent the most direct and key impacts on these habitats. Greece acknowledges the issue of incomplete information on the extent of these habitats, which it seeks to address through a measure on improving their mapping. However, it is not clear whether and how the conservation of the composition of benthic macro-fauna and ecological quality will be ensured through the measures reported for seabed habitats. The GES and targets are thus partially addressed by the reported measures.";"Water column habitats: GES and targets defined by Greece are not addressed by the reported measures. Only monitoring efforts are performed regarding coastal locations (linked to land-based activities).

EL ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
In its measures reported for biodiversity, and more specifically for fish and cephalopods species, Greece does not identify any specific pressure on fish and cephalopods. It does mention fishing and aquaculture as general activities likely to have an impact on biodiversity as a whole and proposes a set of transversal measures for the entire set of biodiversity groups. These measures focus on spatial protection and only address fishing via restrictions in some of the protected areas which host remarkable seabed habitats such as Posidonia meadows, which are relevant for fish given their role as nursery grounds. Therefore, while the proposed measures will protect both commercial and non-commercial species, their impact will be limited to some MPAs. 

By-catch from fisheries, while acknowledged and addressed by most Member States, is only vaguely mentioned in Greece’s PoM, is not addressed by biodiversity measures and would only indirectly be covered by fishing restrictions in certain MPAs. 

The pressures on fish and cephalopods are therefore considered as not addressed, as the reported measures offer some protection and large uncertainty exists about how this species group is protected beyond these MPAs and which particular species are addressed. 

In its measures reported for biodiversity, and more specifically for mammal and reptile species, Greece’s PoM does not identify specific pressures on marine mammals and reptiles other than fishing and aquaculture, which are identified in a general manner for all biodiversity groups and addressed through spatial protection and planning measures. 

By-catch from fisheries, while acknowledged and addressed by most Member States, is only vaguely mentioned in Greece’s PoM and is not addressed by biodiversity measures. No additional pressures are addressed by Greece, meaning that pollution, marine litter and noise, acknowledged and tackled by most of the Member States in the region, are not considered by Greece. 

At regional level, Greece links its PoM for mammals to UNEP/MAP and the Ramsar Convention, as well as to ACCOBAMS, committing to strengthening their participation. While this could serve as a framework to build future measures tackling specific pressures, the current PoM focuses only on monitoring of mammals and reptiles and does not address pressures on the species.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Fish and cephalopods: The pressures are not addressed, as extraction of species caused by fisheries is covered but only for some MPAs. Therefore, despite protecting both commercial and non-commercial species, the effect of the measures will be limited to these protected areas. No further pressures are addressed.

Mammals and reptiles: Pressures for mammals and reptiles are not addressed. No specific pressures on mammals are identified by Greece and only spatial protection is provided, which could lower pressures in MPAs. However, the MPAs are not detailed and the scope of the measures is limited to these protected spaces. ";1;Not addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/49ab027b-8dd7-468a-a4f2-64dd7da37530/details
EL ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Greece defined GES for fish under food webs (D4), setting out the maintenance of biomass proportions over the catch of demersal fish, and maintenance of the populations of large pelagic fish as the desirable conditions. By-catch of non-target species in fisheries should also be reduced to levels that do not threaten the structure of food webs.
The existing measures include the establishment of two National Parks and other MPAs within the Natura 2000 network, aiming to protect fish stocks and prevent impacts from fisheries, as well as the development of artificial reefs, which also aim to restore local fish stocks. Commercial fishing practices could be considered partially addressed by the monitoring of fishing activity and restrictions on fishing gear, via measures such as the implementation of the National Programme for Fisheries Data Collection and the Integration of the systematic data collection and research on the abundance, distribution, and population dynamics of fish and cephalopod species. Non-commercial species of fish and cephalopods are not considered in sufficient detail to meet the GES definitions. 

Greece reports a D4 Food webs target that concerns fish species. It focuses on the monitoring and assessment of biomass balances at higher trophic levels in the total catch of demersal fish. However, Greece’s PoM focuses strictly on fisheries-related restrictions and data collection, showing no evidence that it has considered non-commercial species beyond those which may be positively affected by spatial protection measures.
Greece linked its PoM on food webs with measures targeting commercial fish and shellfish (D3), but there is no evidence that these address any non-commercial species. The PoM thus only partially addresses GES and targets for fish and cephalopods.

Greece provided species-specific GES definition for mammals and reptiles, focusing on monk seals and loggerhead sea turtles, aiming to avoid changes in population sizes and distribution, in both cases. 
Among the measures reported by Greece, mammals and reptiles are mainly covered by spatial protection measures, namely, the development of the two National Parks and the Marine Natura 2000 network. A new measure linked to marine mammals and reptiles deals with monitoring efforts and aims to strengthen Greece’s participation in ACCOBAMS. 
Although marine mammals and reptiles may be sufficiently monitored and managed within the framework of the Habitats Directive, more information is needed on how these species will be protected and restored, especially in open seas and other areas beyond the remit of the Habitats Directive.  

Greece defined species-specific targets for the same two species, the monk seal and the loggerhead sea turtle, which mirror the GES definition by focusing on their population sizes, including the conservation of spawning areas for loggerhead sea turtles.
 Both targets are addressed via spatial protection measures (two National Marine Parks are the two hot spots for these species in Greece's marine waters). 
While spatial protection measures are likely to provide protection for these species’ habitats within these areas, the achievement of both GES and targets may be compromised by the lack of a protection framework beyond MPAs. Therefore, the measures partially address the GES and targets definitions.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Fish and cephalopods: GES and targets are partially addressed by the PoM. The measures reported by Greece will reduce fishing impacts, but their effect is strictly limited to the MPAs. Targets for fish are considered under food webs (D4) and are also addressed under commercial fish and shellfish (D3). However, there is no evidence that measures under this descriptor would protect any non-commercial species beyond MPAs.

EL ;MED ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
In its measures reported for biodiversity, and more specifically for water column habitats, Greece does not identify any specific pressure on water column habitats. It does mention fishing and aquaculture as general activities likely to have an impact on the biodiversity groups as a whole. Water column habitats are only mentioned in a measure focusing on monitoring coastal waters, not providing any actual reduction on the pressures nor working towards the improvement of water quality in water column habitats. 

As for the rest of the species and habitats groups, spatial protection measures may indirectly help to reduce pressures on water column habitats, although the extent of their impact is limited to MPAs. 

It is possible that measures reported under other descriptors will, in practice, tackle other pressures likely to have an impact on water column habitats, but this cannot be confirmed by the information provided. 

Based on these considerations, the pressures on water column habitats are considered as not addressed.

In its Article 8 reporting, Greece identified physical loss and damage as relevant pressures for seabed integrity. It reported that marine mining, land claim and coastal defence, and submarine cables and pipelines, as well as tourism and recreation, cause physical loss, while fisheries (including recreational fishing), dredging, aquaculture, agriculture and forestry, industry and urban activities (mainly due to waste water discharge) cause physical damage. It should however be noted that these land-based sources of waste discharges (agriculture, industry and urban activities) are also relevant sources of contaminant and nutrient enrichment-related pressures that have an impact on seabed habitats.

The reported measures are mainly spatial protection and monitoring/mapping efforts. Greece does not report any plans or management measures to reduce the impacts of activities in areas beyond those protected (natural parks and Natura 2000 sites, mainly). Impacts from land-based activities such as industry, agriculture or urban areas are mostly due to run-off or emissions. MPAs are therefore not a solution for managing their potential impacts on seabed habitats. These pressures might be tackled by the measures reported under other descriptors, but Greece does not provide any link to how these measures would benefit seabed habitat. Still, fisheries are covered by the measures and specific seabed habitats are protected within MPAs. The PoM thus partially addresses these pressures.

At the subregional level (Adriatic Sea, Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea and Aegean-Levantine Sea), it is worth mentioning that Greece includes tourism and recreation (including yachting) as a relevant activity causing impacts (physical loss or damage) on seabed habitats. Only Slovenia and Malta similarly reported this activity in the subregion. 
In all subregions, a majority of Member States reported land claim/coastal defence, as well as submarine cable and pipeline operations, as relevant pressures likely to cause physical loss. Greece might address both of these, as explained above. But considering the information provided, this cannot be guaranteed.

Regarding relevant activities likely to cause physical damage, all of the Member States in the region, except Cyprus, highlight the problem of fisheries. Dredging, industry and urban activities are only considered by Greece and Malta. 
Port operations are identified as relevant activities (especially for physical loss) by every Member State in the region, except Greece. Given that Greece holds the port of Piraeus, one of the busiest in Europe, it is likely that port operations also have an impact on seabed habitats in Greece even though it is not included in the PoM.  

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives concerns seafloor integrity: ‘Sea‐floor integrity is maintained, especially in priority benthic habitats (with associated operational objectives and indicators). The Plan Bleu Regional Activity Centre (one of six UNEP/MAP’s Regional Advisory Committees, RACs) explains that, despite efforts, the Mediterranean Sea still faces several pressures, among which are the fishing methods destroying or disturbing the seafloor. Greece addresses the impacts on seabed habitats from fishing, dredging and submarine cables largely only through spatial protection measures. 

Overall, the reported measures only partially address the pressures relevant for seabed habitats.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: Pressures for water column habitats are not addressed. The reported measure specifically addressing water column habitats is limited to monitoring efforts in coastal locations. Spatial protection measures may indirectly help to lower general pressures on these habitats, although their effect will be limited to MPAs. 

Seabed habitats: The measures partially address the relevant pressures. Physical loss and damage from activities such as fisheries, dredging, submarine cables and pipelines, and tourism were identified as relevant by Greece. The reported measures only directly address fisheries, not any other pressure or activity. The measures are strictly spatial protection measures; thus, they may restrict activities in MPAs but not in the Greek marine waters as a whole. Activities beyond fisheries, especially land-based activities, might be covered by measures reported under other descriptors. However, no such link is clearly made.

EL ;MED ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Greece defined GES for water column habitats as the maintenance of the planktonic communities in compliance with the environmental quality criteria. Phytoplankton is assessed as part of the existing measures under the WFD, through the monitoring of qualitative biological figures. 
The reported measure specifically addressing water column habitats focuses on monitoring and is limited to coastal locations. Spatial protection measures will collaborate to protect planktonic communities from sea-based impacts, although only in MPAs. No further information is provided in relation to measures addressing other impacts on the water column.

Greece defined targets that aim to preserve the structure of the benthic macro-fauna and plankton communities. The measures reported would help in monitoring these indicators on coastal locations and lowering pressures in MPAs, despite their limited effects in terms of activities and spatial scope covered.
The reported measures thus do not address GES nor targets for water column habitats since they only concern spatial protection and monitoring efforts, not directly tackling any impacts on these habitats.

Greece defined GES for seabed habitats as ‘the preservation of benthic ecosystems in a sufficient size and health to perform their natural functions, while keeping the number of opportunistic species within the boundaries of acceptable ecological quality’.

At least seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) and maerl beds are considered covered within the measures reported by Greece, via trawling restrictions.

For its targets, Greece aims to preserve the structure of the composition of benthic macro-fauna, monitor the proportion of resistant/opportunistic species within this group, and address the knowledge gaps in the distribution and location of these habitats. This aim is addressed by efforts on improving the mapping of these habitats. 

Overall, the measures on restricting trawling on seagrass and maerl beds will prevent the most direct and key impacts on these habitats. Greece acknowledges the issue of incomplete information on the extent of these habitats, which it seeks to address through a measure on improving their mapping. However, it is not clear whether and how the conservation of the composition of benthic macro-fauna and ecological quality will be ensured through the measures reported for seabed habitats.

ES ;MED ;13;D1-B;Coverage of pressures;"Spain’s PoM addresses impacts of various pressures on bird habitats through general legislation measures, action plans, conservation plans and spatial protection measures (39 measures, e.g. M026, M066, EMP1, BIO7, H6). Spain also addresses the impact on bird habitats from fisheries activities though three measures (M039, M316, EC7). In addition, one measure addresses a number of nautical activities, including diving, recreational navigation, anchoring boats etc., and their impacts on bird habitats (BIO13). 
Bird by-catch caused by fisheries is addressed by 11 measures (e.g. M033, M084, BIO3, EC9). Spain also reports one measure which addresses NIS impacts on birds (M202). It will address pollution for birds caused by aquaculture (H13) or various activities, such as diffuse sources, pollution from ships or atmospheric deposition, prospecting and exploitation of minerals, gas or oil, entrances from the rivers (CONT3). Oil pollution impacts on birds will also be addressed (CONT2). Spain reports two measures that will reduce marine litter impacts on birds (M329, BM10). Light pollution impacting birds will only be addressed in the Canary Islands subdivision (M203).

ES ;MED ;13;D1-B;Coverage of GES and targets;"GES for birds was defined for all five subdivisions and comprises indicators and criteria-based statements, with detailed statements on the state, condition and trend of seabird colonies, breeding populations and survival rates. These definitions are primarily focused on breeding rate of Procellariiformes, in addition to Pelacaniformes and Charadriiformes. Spain’s MPAs, spatial protection measures and conservation plan measures will contribute to the protection of seabird habitats and their breeding colonies, and will support their breeding rates. 
Even though Spain does not specifically mention Procellariiformes or Pelacaniformes in its measures, it is likely that these species will be covered by actions under the Birds Directive, national and regional conservation plans in addition to actions under the RSC and the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP). 
The GES for birds requires a reduction of by-catch and thus the implementation of measures to reduce by-catch. As Spain reports a large number of by-catch-reducing measures, these aspects are also addressed by the PoM. 
Spain’s GES requires an expansion of the IBA (Important Bird Area) network, which will be supported by the MPA designation and extension measures that Spain reports for birds.
Finally, the GES also requires a reduction of impacts on birds by light pollution; however, Spain only reports a measure addressing this aspect for the Canary Islands subdivision. It is possible that Spain addresses this aspect through conservation plans and MPAs in other subdivisions but this cannot be assessed based on the information provided. It is also possible that this issue is not relevant in other subdivisions. 

Spain’s targets are mostly general and not species-specific. The general targets will be discussed in this section and apply to all species groups and habitat types:
•	Target A.1.5 links to NIS impacts originating from aquaculture. Spain reports measures on aquaculture plans and reports measures on NIS control measures and eradication plans, thus this target is addressed.
•	Target A.1.8 aims to develop species recovery initiatives and habitat rehabilitation measures. These initiatives have been reported for most species and are supported by spatial protection measures. 
•	Target A.2.1 covers the strengthening of the Spanish MPA network in all subdivisions to protect specific habitats. This target will be covered by measures focusing on an increase in MPAs in Spain’s marine waters. 
•	Target C.1.1 aims to maintain and update the list of threatened species. This target will be covered by Spain as it reports both regional and national measures for the maintenance of these lists.
•	Target C.1.5 requires the development of regulation plans for recreational marine activities, such as diving, sport fishing, vessel anchoring, wildlife watching, etc. Spain reports several measures which either regulate these activities or aim to provide activities which are examples of good practices.  
•	Target C.3.8 requires the increase of knowledge on the marine food webs in coastal and deep ocean ecosystems. This target is likely to be covered by national monitoring activities rather than the PoM. 
Specifically applicable to birds, Spain reports the following targets:
•	Target A.1.4 requires the reduction of the main causes of bird mortality, such as by-catch, ingestion of litter, pollution, habitat destruction or terrestrial predators. Spain reports measures which address all of these aspects for birds. 
•	Target A.2.2 aims for a completion of the Natura 2000 network in Spanish waters through the designation of IBA and SPAs. Spain covers this target, as it reports spatial protection measures and measures under which new MPAs will be designated for birds. 
•	Target A.3.3 aims to maintain the distribution range of species, while target A.3.5 aims to maintain positive or stable trends in extent of habitat distribution.

ES ;MED ;13;D1-F;Coverage of GES and targets;"The GES definitions for fish are applicable to all subdivisions, apart from the Canary Islands subdivision, for which no GES has been defined. The GES definitions for fish include consideration of the status of ‘k-strategists’ and ‘r-strategists’ species and the percentage of grid squares (of an undefined area) which maintain or increase the presence of representative demersal species. Population size and the size distribution of the fish species groups are also considered in the GES. Spain also mentions ‘the average maximum size’ of demersal fish and a ‘conservation status of fish’ indicator tool in its GES definition. The combination of existing and new measures mostly addresses the GES definitions. The wider objectives of the GES linked to assessing populations, demographics, distribution and diversity are considered in the PoM, with a strong emphasis on by-catch and the regulation of harmful human activities. Therefore, the PoM contributes to the achievement of GES.
Fish targets include the general targets which have been described for birds above and which are mostly addressed (A.1.5, A.1.8, A.2.1, C.1.1, C.1.5, C.3.8).
Specific fish targets were also defined:
•	Target A.1.4 aims to reduce the main causes of fish mortality, such as by-catch, ingestion of marine litter, marine pollution and overfishing. All these aspects are covered by measures in the PoM.
•	Target A.1.6 aims to push for regulations to avoid the commercial exploitation of marine elasmobranches, as listed in EU Directives, international agreements and national law, while target A.3.1 covers the maintenance of stable size distribution of teleosts and elasmobranch species. Spain reports a number of measures focusing on the regulation of elasmobranch fishing and reduction of its by-catch. These measures also link to RSC action plans and the EU Habitats Directive. Therefore, these targets are covered by Spain. 
•	Target A.3.1 aims to maintain the Conservation Status of Fish (CSF). Spain reports measures to regulate and reduce fishing activities and consequently reduce fishing pressure. These measures will likely contribute to the achievement of this target.

The GES definitions for fish include consideration of the status of ‘k-strategists’ and ‘r-strategists’ species and the percentage of grid squares (of an undefined area) which maintain or increase the presence of representative demersal species. Population size and the size distribution of the fish species groups are also considered in the GES. Spain also mentions ‘the average maximum size’ of demersal fish and a ‘conservation status of fish’ indicator tool in its GES definition. The combination of existing and new measures mostly addresses the GES definitions. The wider objectives of the GES linked to assessing populations, demographics, distribution and diversity are considered in the PoM, with a strong emphasis on by-catch and the regulation of harmful human activities.

ES ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Spain addresses general impacts on water column habitats through 28 measures (e.g. M149, M224, EMP1, H6) for which the addressed activities have not been specified. It also addresses impacts of fisheries (M039, M485), aquaculture (164) and extractive and energy-related activities (M320). Spain reports two measures which will cover NIS impacts on water column habitats (M353, EAI2). Also, it considers impacts on hydrological conditions caused by beach replenishment (BIO36). Furthermore, pollution caused by aquaculture (H13), land-sea discharges, dredging and dumping and other various activities, such as diffuse sources, pollution from ships or atmospheric deposition, prospecting and exploitation of minerals, gas or oil, discharge from the rivers (CONT3, CONT4, CONT5) are all covered by Spain. Finally, Spain also addresses marine litter (M329). 

Overall, Spain does not report measures that specifically address phytoplankton or zooplankton communities of water column habitats. Nevertheless, spatial protection measures, in addition to measures on pollution, NIS and hydrological conditions, will partially address pressures for this habitat. By linking measures that have primarily been reported to address pressures under other descriptors, Spain is recognising that those pressures are also impacting water column habitats, which is a positive aspect of the Spanish PoM. Therefore, the pressures are covered.

Spain identified physical loss as a relevant pressure for its three marine subregions under Article 8 (Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, Macaronesia and Western Mediterranean Sea). The Member State reports land claim/coastal defence, submarine cable/pipeline operations and port operations/dredging/solid waste disposal (including dredge material) as relevant activities causing this pressure in the three marine subregions. Spain also reports marine mining (sand extraction specifically) in the Bay of Biscay (especially South Atlantic) and Iberian Coast subregion. Artificial reefs have also been highlighted as potential sources of physical loss. Several measures are reported which address all these sources of physical loss. 

Spain identified the pressure ‘physical damage’ as relevant for its Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast and Western Mediterranean Sea subregions in its Article 8 reporting. Three existing and five new measures will aim to reduce physical damage from fishing activities. Therefore, this activity is covered in certain areas, in particular MPAs, by Spain. Nevertheless, Spain’s marine area is vast and covers several subregions. The information reported in the PoM does not allow an assessment on whether Spain’s measures are sufficient to address the pressure physical damage on the seabed caused by bottom trawling activities. In addition, Spain had reported land claim and coastal defence as causes of this pressure. As stated above, this activity is addressed by one new measure (BIO36) for all subdivisions. Spain also reports tourism (Western Mediterranean Sea) and dredging/port operations/solid waste disposal, for which some measures are in place, as well as marine mining (Western Mediterranean Sea) and hydrocarbon extraction, which do not seem to be covered by any measures (although general measures might address this activity). For Macaronesia, Spain reported dredging/port operations/solid waste disposal to be relevant activities causing physical damage. Two new measures address these activities. Spain also reports land claim/coastal defence as source of physical damage, for which measures have been defined, and marine mining that does not seem to be covered (although, again, general measures might address this activity).

In the three subregions, Spain mentions, in its Article 8, the role of artificial reefs and sunken ships as sources of physical damage. As noted for physical loss, these aspects are also covered in the PoM.

At the subregional level, in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast and in Macaronesia, France and Portugal identified the pressure ‘physical loss’ under article 8. The responsible activities reported by both France and Portugal are port operations/dredging/solid waste disposal and submarine cables and pipeline operations. Spain puts in place measures that cover these activities. For physical damage, France and Portugal especially highlight the role of fisheries and dredging. Spain defined measures on these activities. 

In the Western Mediterranean, France and Italy both identified submarine cables/pipeline operations, port operations and land claim/coastal defence as relevant for physical loss, with fisheries as relevant cause of physical damage under their Article 8 reporting. Spain’s identified pressures are therefore in line with its neighbouring states.  

In addition to physical damage and physical loss, Spain also addresses a number of other pressures for seabed habitats. These include various impacts on seabed habitats addressed by spatial protection measures, national and regional legislation and action plans (49 measures, including M208, M072, EMP1, EMP17). 

Spain covers recreational fishing (M163), aquaculture (M164), access to genetic resources (M319), extraction and energy uses (M320), and recreational diving activities (M162). 

It also covers pollution caused by aquaculture (H13), land-sea discharges (CONT4), dredging and dumping of dredge material (CONT4) and a number of various activities (including losses from diffuse sources, pollution from ships or atmospheric deposition, prospecting and exploitation of minerals, gas or oil, discharge from the rivers) (CONT3). Also, Spain covers marine litter (M329, BM10) and NIS (EAI2) for seabed habitats.

Overall, pressures for seabed habitats are partially addressed, as even though measures have been reported to address the pressures physical loss and damage and their linked activities, it is not clear how much the measures will address the vast extent of these pressures in the Spanish marine environment and reduce their negative effects.";"Water column habitats: Even though no water column specific measures are reported, spatial protection measures, in addition to measures on pollution, NIS and hydrological conditions, will address pressures for this habitat.

ES ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Water column habitats are not specifically mentioned in Spain’s GES definition. However, consideration is given to the structure of the plankton community for the ‘North Atlantic subdivision’ under the heading ‘Ecosystem’, which is measured through various indicators of taxonomic groups. There are limited specific references to water column habitats in the new and existing measures, which mainly focus on conservation measures and improving knowledge of associated pelagic species. However, general habitat protecting measures - such as spatial protection measures - will support the achievement of GES. Furthermore, Spain is reporting measures that address pressures under other descriptors and which are also particularly relevant for water column habitats, such as measures aiming at reducing marine pollution and NIS impacts. Therefore, the measures address GES. 

Targets for water column habitats include the general targets described above for birds and which are mostly addressed (A.1.5, A.1.8, A.2.1, C.1.1, C.1.5, C.3.8).
Spain does not report targets for water column habitats specifically, however, targets linking to ‘habitats’ also apply to water column habitats:
•	Target A.2.1. aims to protect habitats through the expansion of the MPA network, while target A.3.5 aims to maintain positive or stable trends in the distribution of habitats. This target will be covered by measures aiming to reduce pressures on water column habitats, such as pollution, hydrological changes and NIS, in addition to spatial protection measures. Measures reported for seabed habitats will also contribute to maintenance of the water column habitats.

For the North and South Atlantic subdivisions and Macaronesia, no seabed habitat-specific GES has been defined. Nevertheless, the GES refers to habitats overall, which includes maintaining or increasing the distribution and extent of protected habitats and the ‘status’ of the habitat in relation to typical species, communities and physical, hydrological and chemical characteristics. The PoM will contribute to the achievement of this general GES, as it includes a large number of seabed habitat-specific measures which aim to reduce anthropogenic impacts and protect vulnerable habitats.
For the Gibraltar and Alboran and Levantine-Balearic subdivisions, specific GES definitions are made for various habitats, such as coastal lagoon habitats, marine angiosperm habitats, subtidal soft bottom habitats and sublittoral rock habitats. There are also further definitions under ‘Descriptor 6’, which include the positive or stable distribution of biogenic habitats, limitations on human activities that risk damaging benthic habitat, and the structure, biomass and richness and diversity of the benthic community. Several of Spain’s measures focus on biogenic reefs and various vulnerable habitats. Therefore, the measures contribute towards the achievement of GES.  

Targets for seabed habitats include the general targets which have been described for birds and which are mostly addressed (A.1.5, A.1.8, A.2.1, C.1.1, C.1.5, C.3.8).
•	Target A.1.1 aims to reduce the intensity and the area of influence of the significant anthropogenic pressures on the benthic habitats (i.e. the biogenic or protected habitats: maërl bottoms, Laminaria community, cold water coral communities, communities dominated by Pennatulacea, aggregations of circalittoral and deep-sea sponges, and coral gardens). This target is addressed through Spain’s spatial protection measures, measures aiming to reduce impacts from fishing, recreational activities and anchoring, and measures which will specifically address the target species. 
•	Target A.2.1 aims to strengthen the Spanish MPA network to protect biogenic habitats, again this target will be covered through measures covering the expansion of the MPA network reported by Spain. 
•	Target A.3.6 aims to maintain sustainable benthic communities, which will be addressed by the combination of spatial protection measures and measures to reduce various anthropogenic impacts. 
•	Target C.3.2, C.3.3, C.3.4 and C.3.5 aim to improve and increase existing knowledge of the seafloor and habitat distributions. The targets will be addressed through measures reported by Spain which focus on seabed habitat surveys and mapping.

Furthermore, Spain reported measures that address pressures under other descriptors and which are also particularly relevant for water column habitats, such as measures which will reduce contaminants and which target NIS. Therefore, the measures address GES. However, no specific measures have been reported that address planktonic communities.

Fisheries’ impacts on mammal and reptile habitats are addressed (M039), in addition to various nautical activities (e.g. diving, recreational navigation, anchoring boats, etc.) (BIO13, BIO47). 

By-catch of marine mammals and reptiles is addressed by 11 measures (e.g. M033, M136, BIO10, EC7). Collisions with ships - including shipping and fishing vessels - is addressed by three measures (M381, M204, BIO31). Spain also addresses underwater noise impacts caused primarily by shipping through one measure (RS1). Marine litter impacts (M329, BM10) and oil pollution (CONT2) are addressed by Spain. Pollution caused by aquaculture and other sources (including losses from diffuse sources, pollution from ships or atmospheric deposition, prospecting and exploitation of minerals, gas or oil, discharge from the rivers) is addressed by two measures (H13, CONT3). 

Overall, pressures on marine mammals are addressed, as Spain covers by-catch of marine mammals and reptiles, in addition to collisions with ships and underwater noise for marine mammals.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment

ES ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
The GES definitions for fish are applicable to all subdivisions, apart from the Canary Islands subdivision, for which no GES has been defined. The GES definitions for fish include consideration of the status of ‘k-strategists’ and ‘r-strategists’ species and the percentage of grid squares (of an undefined area) which maintain or increase the presence of representative demersal species. Population size and the size distribution of the fish species groups are also considered in the GES. Spain also mentions ‘the average maximum size’ of demersal fish and a ‘conservation status of fish’ indicator tool in its GES definition. The combination of existing and new measures mostly addresses the GES definitions. The wider objectives of the GES linked to assessing populations, demographics, distribution and diversity are considered in the PoM, with a strong emphasis on by-catch and the regulation of harmful human activities. Therefore, the PoM contributes to the achievement of GES.
Fish targets include the general targets which have been described for birds above and which are mostly addressed (A.1.5, A.1.8, A.2.1, C.1.1, C.1.5, C.3.8).
Specific fish targets were also defined:
•	Target A.1.4 aims to reduce the main causes of fish mortality, such as by-catch, ingestion of marine litter, marine pollution and overfishing. All these aspects are covered by measures in the PoM.
•	Target A.1.6 aims to push for regulations to avoid the commercial exploitation of marine elasmobranches, as listed in EU Directives, international agreements and national law, while target A.3.1 covers the maintenance of stable size distribution of teleosts and elasmobranch species. Spain reports a number of measures focusing on the regulation of elasmobranch fishing and reduction of its by-catch. These measures also link to RSC action plans and the EU Habitats Directive. Therefore, these targets are covered by Spain. 
•	Target A.3.1 aims to maintain the Conservation Status of Fish (CSF). Spain reports measures to regulate and reduce fishing activities and consequently reduce fishing pressure. These measures will likely contribute to the achievement of this target.  
•	Target A.3.3 aims to maintain the distribution range of species, while target A.3.5 covers the maintenance of positive trends in habitat distributions. These targets are addressed by the PoM through spatial protection measures and fishing regulation measures.

The mammal and reptile GES definitions apply to all subdivisions and focus on the area and distribution of these species groups, in addition to their population size being maintained without significant loss. The impact of anthropogenic activities and demographic aspects are also considered. The achievement of GES will be supported by the PoM, which protects mammal and reptile habitats through MPAs and spatial protection measures to improve their distribution and maintain population size. Anthropogenic impacts, such as collisions and interference from ships, underwater noise and by-catch will be covered by the PoM. It will therefore support the achievement of GES for mammals and reptiles. 

Targets for mammals include the general targets which have been described for birds above and which are mostly addressed (A.1.5, A.1.8, A.2.1, C.1.1, C.1.5, C.3.8).
Specific mammal and reptile targets are:
•	Target A.1.4 aims to reduce the main causes of mammal and reptile mortality, such as by-catch, ingestion of marine litter, marine pollution, collision with vessels. Spain reports measures to address all of these pressures for marine mammals.
•	Target A.1.7 focuses on the establishment of a national coordination system where accidental catches or strandings of marine mammals and reptiles are monitored. Spain reports measures on the monitoring of by-catch and on developing a network of information exchange on standings.
•	Target A.3.3 aims to maintain the distribution range of species, while target A.3.5 convers the maintenance of positive trends in habitat distributions. These targets are addressed by Spain’s PoM through spatial protection measures and measures that aim to reduce disturbances of marine mammals caused by underwater noise and collisions with vessels.  
•	Target C.1.2 requires the promotion of international cooperation for the monitoring of species with a wide geographical distribution, such as marine cetaceans and reptiles. Spain does not specifically state its collaboration with other countries to monitor these species, however, this collaboration is likely taking place at the RSC level and between EU Member States under the MSFD.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment

ES ;MED ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Spain addresses general impacts on water column habitats through 28 measures (e.g. M149, M224, EMP1, H6) for which the addressed activities have not been specified. It also addresses impacts of fisheries (M039, M485), aquaculture (164) and extractive and energy-related activities (M320). Spain reports two measures which will cover NIS impacts on water column habitats (M353, EAI2). Also, it considers impacts on hydrological conditions caused by beach replenishment (BIO36). Furthermore, pollution caused by aquaculture (H13), land-sea discharges, dredging and dumping and other various activities, such as diffuse sources, pollution from ships or atmospheric deposition, prospecting and exploitation of minerals, gas or oil, discharge from the rivers (CONT3, CONT4, CONT5) are all covered by Spain. Finally, Spain also addresses marine litter (M329). 

Overall, Spain does not report measures that specifically address phytoplankton or zooplankton communities of water column habitats. Nevertheless, spatial protection measures, in addition to measures on pollution, NIS and hydrological conditions, will partially address pressures for this habitat. By linking measures that have primarily been reported to address pressures under other descriptors, Spain is recognising that those pressures are also impacting water column habitats, which is a positive aspect of the Spanish PoM. Therefore, the pressures are covered.

Spain identified physical loss as a relevant pressure for its three marine subregions under Article 8 (Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, Macaronesia and Western Mediterranean Sea). The Member State reports land claim/coastal defence, submarine cable/pipeline operations and port operations/dredging/solid waste disposal (including dredge material) as relevant activities causing this pressure in the three marine subregions. Spain also reports marine mining (sand extraction specifically) in the Bay of Biscay (especially South Atlantic) and Iberian Coast subregion. Artificial reefs have also been highlighted as potential sources of physical loss. Several measures are reported which address all these sources of physical loss. 

Spain identified the pressure ‘physical damage’ as relevant for its Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast and Western Mediterranean Sea subregions in its Article 8 reporting. Three existing and five new measures will aim to reduce physical damage from fishing activities. Therefore, this activity is covered in certain areas, in particular MPAs, by Spain. Nevertheless, Spain’s marine area is vast and covers several subregions. The information reported in the PoM does not allow an assessment on whether Spain’s measures are sufficient to address the pressure physical damage on the seabed caused by bottom trawling activities. In addition, Spain had reported land claim and coastal defence as causes of this pressure. As stated above, this activity is addressed by one new measure (BIO36) for all subdivisions. Spain also reports tourism (Western Mediterranean Sea) and dredging/port operations/solid waste disposal, for which some measures are in place, as well as marine mining (Western Mediterranean Sea) and hydrocarbon extraction, which do not seem to be covered by any measures (although general measures might address this activity). For Macaronesia, Spain reported dredging/port operations/solid waste disposal to be relevant activities causing physical damage. Two new measures address these activities. Spain also reports land claim/coastal defence as source of physical damage, for which measures have been defined, and marine mining that does not seem to be covered (although, again, general measures might address this activity).

In the three subregions, Spain mentions, in its Article 8, the role of artificial reefs and sunken ships as sources of physical damage. As noted for physical loss, these aspects are also covered in the PoM.

At the subregional level, in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast and in Macaronesia, France and Portugal identified the pressure ‘physical loss’ under article 8. The responsible activities reported by both France and Portugal are port operations/dredging/solid waste disposal and submarine cables and pipeline operations. Spain puts in place measures that cover these activities. For physical damage, France and Portugal especially highlight the role of fisheries and dredging. Spain defined measures on these activities. 

In the Western Mediterranean, France and Italy both identified submarine cables/pipeline operations, port operations and land claim/coastal defence as relevant for physical loss, with fisheries as relevant cause of physical damage under their Article 8 reporting. Spain’s identified pressures are therefore in line with its neighbouring states.  

In addition to physical damage and physical loss, Spain also addresses a number of other pressures for seabed habitats. These include various impacts on seabed habitats addressed by spatial protection measures, national and regional legislation and action plans (49 measures, including M208, M072, EMP1, EMP17). 

Spain covers recreational fishing (M163), aquaculture (M164), access to genetic resources (M319), extraction and energy uses (M320), and recreational diving activities (M162). 

It also covers pollution caused by aquaculture (H13), land-sea discharges (CONT4), dredging and dumping of dredge material (CONT4) and a number of various activities (including losses from diffuse sources, pollution from ships or atmospheric deposition, prospecting and exploitation of minerals, gas or oil, discharge from the rivers) (CONT3). Also, Spain covers marine litter (M329, BM10) and NIS (EAI2) for seabed habitats.

Overall, pressures for seabed habitats are partially addressed, as even though measures have been reported to address the pressures physical loss and damage and their linked activities, it is not clear how much the measures will address the vast extent of these pressures in the Spanish marine environment and reduce their negative effects.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: Even though no water column specific measures are reported, spatial protection measures, in addition to measures on pollution, NIS and hydrological conditions, will address pressures for this habitat.

Seabed habitats: The PoM partially addresses the pressure ‘physical loss and damage’ reported under Article 8. A number of spatial protection measures and measures that specifically cover activities causing the pressure, such as hydrocarbon exploitation, dredging, renewable energies, underwater cables and pipelines, aquaculture, fisheries, etc. will support the reduction of the pressures; however, it is not clear from the reported measures how much the pressures will be reduced across the large areas of seabed habitats where the pressures occur and thus whether the measures will reduce impacts on affected seabed habitats.

ES ;MED ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats are not specifically mentioned in Spain’s GES definition. However, consideration is given to the structure of the plankton community for the ‘North Atlantic subdivision’ under the heading ‘Ecosystem’, which is measured through various indicators of taxonomic groups. There are limited specific references to water column habitats in the new and existing measures, which mainly focus on conservation measures and improving knowledge of associated pelagic species. However, general habitat protecting measures - such as spatial protection measures - will support the achievement of GES. Furthermore, Spain is reporting measures that address pressures under other descriptors and which are also particularly relevant for water column habitats, such as measures aiming at reducing marine pollution and NIS impacts. Therefore, the measures address GES. 

Targets for water column habitats include the general targets described above for birds and which are mostly addressed (A.1.5, A.1.8, A.2.1, C.1.1, C.1.5, C.3.8).
Spain does not report targets for water column habitats specifically, however, targets linking to ‘habitats’ also apply to water column habitats:
•	Target A.2.1. aims to protect habitats through the expansion of the MPA network, while target A.3.5 aims to maintain positive or stable trends in the distribution of habitats. This target will be covered by measures aiming to reduce pressures on water column habitats, such as pollution, hydrological changes and NIS, in addition to spatial protection measures. Measures reported for seabed habitats will also contribute to maintenance of the water column habitats.

For the North and South Atlantic subdivisions and Macaronesia, no seabed habitat-specific GES has been defined. Nevertheless, the GES refers to habitats overall, which includes maintaining or increasing the distribution and extent of protected habitats and the ‘status’ of the habitat in relation to typical species, communities and physical, hydrological and chemical characteristics. The PoM will contribute to the achievement of this general GES, as it includes a large number of seabed habitat-specific measures which aim to reduce anthropogenic impacts and protect vulnerable habitats.
For the Gibraltar and Alboran and Levantine-Balearic subdivisions, specific GES definitions are made for various habitats, such as coastal lagoon habitats, marine angiosperm habitats, subtidal soft bottom habitats and sublittoral rock habitats. There are also further definitions under ‘Descriptor 6’, which include the positive or stable distribution of biogenic habitats, limitations on human activities that risk damaging benthic habitat, and the structure, biomass and richness and diversity of the benthic community. Several of Spain’s measures focus on biogenic reefs and various vulnerable habitats. Therefore, the measures contribute towards the achievement of GES.  

Targets for seabed habitats include the general targets which have been described for birds and which are mostly addressed (A.1.5, A.1.8, A.2.1, C.1.1, C.1.5, C.3.8).
•	Target A.1.1 aims to reduce the intensity and the area of influence of the significant anthropogenic pressures on the benthic habitats (i.e. the biogenic or protected habitats: maërl bottoms, Laminaria community, cold water coral communities, communities dominated by Pennatulacea, aggregations of circalittoral and deep-sea sponges, and coral gardens). This target is addressed through Spain’s spatial protection measures, measures aiming to reduce impacts from fishing, recreational activities and anchoring, and measures which will specifically address the target species. 
•	Target A.2.1 aims to strengthen the Spanish MPA network to protect biogenic habitats, again this target will be covered through measures covering the expansion of the MPA network reported by Spain. 
•	Target A.3.6 aims to maintain sustainable benthic communities, which will be addressed by the combination of spatial protection measures and measures to reduce various anthropogenic impacts. 
•	Target C.3.2, C.3.3, C.3.4 and C.3.5 aim to improve and increase existing knowledge of the seafloor and habitat distributions. The targets will be addressed through measures reported by Spain which focus on seabed habitat surveys and mapping. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: Spain does not define GES and targets for water column habitats; however, they have been defined for habitats overall, which include water column habitats. Habitat-protecting measures, such as spatial protection measures, measures aiming at reducing marine pollution and NIS impacts, will support the achievement of GES. Furthermore, Spain reported measures that address pressures under other descriptors and which are also particularly relevant for water column habitats, such as measures which will reduce contaminants and which target NIS. Therefore, the measures address GES. However, no specific measures have been reported that address planktonic communities. 

Seabed habitats: For the North and South Atlantic subdivisions and Macaronesia, no seabed habitat-specific GES has been defined. Nevertheless, the GES refers to maintaining and protecting habitats overall, which will be addressed by seabed habitat specific measures which aim to reduce anthropogenic impacts and protect vulnerable habitats. For the Gibraltar and Alboran and Levantine-Balearic subdivisions, habitat-specific GES definitions exist for various habitats and will be addressed by measures on biogenic reefs and various vulnerable habitats.

Finland reports overarching targets for all species groups and habitats. For D1, 4 Finland reports target 3 and 6 as directly relevant. Target 3 aims to ensure that the diversity of species, habitats and ecosystems are protected and refers to functioning food webs. In relation to birds, this general target is covered by the measures. Target 6 refers to MSP plans, which is addressed by the implementation of the Marine Spatial Planning Directive (Directive 2014/89/EU). Furthermore, Finland links target 1, 4 and 5 indirectly to D1, 4.

Two measures will address nutrient enrichment from sea and land-based sources respectively (M003-EUTRO, M004-EUTRO). Finland also addresses water flow in fish habitats, including diadromous fish species, to improve the conditions of flowing water bodies (M019-HYDRO, M004-EUTRO).

Finland states that the ringed seal was currently the only marine mammal species in its waters, for which GES had not been achieved yet. Therefore, it reported mostly measures that targets this species.

Finland reports that based on an initial assessment, the implementation of the existing and new measures of its PoM will lead to a decrease in human pressures on the marine environment, species and habitats by 2020. However, it states that GES cannot be fully achieved by 2020, as the recovery of some damaged ecosystems will require more time. This applies particularly to habitats and species impacted by nutrient enrichment and the contamination by harmful substances. Finland also states that it might take anywhere from years to decades for positive changes from measures to become noticeable. It does, however, indicate that GES will be achieved by 2020 for seabed habitats.

Timeline of implementation of the PoM
Most of Finland’s measures reported for biodiversity will be implemented before or by 2016, apart from:
•	Measure M013-LITT on litter and M015-NOISE on noise, which will be rolled out in several phases starting in 2016 and then in 2019.
•	Measure M018-PHYS on physical seabed impacts, which will also be rolled out in phases starting in 2016, and then in 2019.";Even though no exception is applied, Finland states that GES might not be achieved by 2020 for all species groups and habitats, apart from seabed habitats, due to pressures from nutrients and contaminants. However, no timeline for achieving GES is specified. Measures are mostly in place by 2016, with some having a staged roll-out planned.

FR ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"In addition to the pressures addressed for most species groups in the North East Atlantic (e.g. impacts on habitats, physical loss, physical damage and litter), France states that it covers extraction of species caused by fisheries (M008-NAT1b) and includes additional measures addressing physical damage caused by sediment extraction and fisheries (M224-NAT1a, M221-NAT1a). It also includes a measure to address litter caused by aquaculture (M304-MMN1b). Therefore, the pressures are addressed.

In addition to the pressures addressed for all species groups (e.g. impacts on habitats, physical loss, physical damage and litter), France reports a number of pressures for seabed habitats in the North East Atlantic. These cover extraction of species caused by fisheries (M008-NAT1b), impacts on seabed habitats (M001-5NAT1b), physical loss caused by mooring and anchoring (e.g. M227-NAT1a), physical damage caused by the extraction of sediment (024-NAT1b, M025-ATL2), dredging and disposal (M024-NAT1b, M014-NAT2), aquaculture (M222-NAT1a) and fisheries (M221-NAT1a). France also addresses longitudinal continuity (M005_KTM1b) and litter inputs from aquaculture (M304-MMN1b). Furthermore, recreational activities are covered by measures that aim to reduce impacts from mooring of yachts and measures that foresee impact assessments before granting permits for public sports events in the marine environment. 
In the NEA, under Article 8, France reports ‘physical loss’ and ‘physical damage’ as pressures in all three subregions. In the North Sea and Bay of Biscay, France reports various activities that are responsible for physical loss such as dredging, aquaculture, land claim/coastal defence, port operations, submarine cables and pipeline operations, and solid waste disposal. Fisheries, seaweed harvesting, marine mining, dredging, submarine cables/pipeline operations and tourism have been mentioned as causes of physical damage. In the Celtic Seas, France reports seaweed harvesting, submarine cables/pipeline operation and land claim/coastal defence in the case of physical loss, as well as fisheries, seaweed harvesting, submarine cables/pipeline operations and research for physical damage. France addresses these pressures through its measures, which tackle most of the activities reported in Article 8 and listed above. France has clarified that in the Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay, coastal defence and port operations are addressed by D7 measures, while research and seaweed harvesting are addressed by D3 measures. As such, pressures are addressed in these two subregions. Nevertheless, in the North Sea, coastal defence, port operations and seaweed harvesting do not appear to be addressed, as such pressures are partially addressed in this subregion. ";"Water column habitats: Water column habitat pressures are partially addressed. The measures address pressures caused by fisheries in both subregions.

In the Mediterranean, France covers a large number of pressures for seabed habitats. It addresses the pressure ‘physical damage’ caused by a range of activities, such as recreational activities (M003-MED1a), mooring and anchoring (M007-MED1a, M030-MED2, M033-34MED2), dredging and disposal (M019-MED1a, M024-NAT1b, M031-MED2), fisheries (M038-MED1b) and non-reported activities (M008-MED1a, M015-MED1a). France also addresses physical loss caused by mooring and anchoring (M007-MED1a), fisheries (M038-MED1b, although it should be noted that the spatial scope for this measure is limited as it does not go beyond 12nm) and non-reported activities (M008-MED1a, M015-MED1a). France includes the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by fisheries through its PoM (M010-MED1a, M020-MED1a, M008-NAT1b). A number of spatial protection measures will address various impacts on seabed habitats, for which activities have not been reported (including M001-MED1a, M017-MED1a, M037-MED2). Also, natural erosion and anthropogenic construction impacts are addressed by the measures (M014-MED1a). France states that it covers the pressure ‘contamination’ caused by industry (M018-MED1a), and dredging and disposal (M024-NAT1b) activity. It also includes measures to address the pressures ‘hydromorphological changes’ and ‘longitudinal continuity’ caused by various activities, including construction and dam-building (M013-MED1a M005_KTM1b).

At the subregional level, France reports physical damage and loss as relevant pressures for its waters in its Article 8 reporting. Aquaculture, land claim, port operations, submarine cable and solid waste disposal have been reported as activities leading to physical loss, while fisheries, marine mining, dredging, submarine cable, tourism and offshore structures have been associated with physical damage. Even though France covers the relevant pressures, the measures reported for this descriptor do not cover some activities such as marine mining, submarine cables, aquaculture and port operations. These are likely to be at least partially addressed by measures from other descriptors, but given the information reported this is not clear.

In addition to the pressures addressed for all species groups (e.g. impacts on habitats, physical loss, physical damage and litter), France reports a number of pressures for the North East Atlantic Ocean. These pressures are ‘extraction of species’ caused by fisheries (M008-NAT1b, M009-ATL2), ‘longitudinal continuity’ (referring to inhibited migration corridors) caused by non-reported activities (M405-ATL1a, M203-NAT1b) and ‘impacts on fish habitats’ (M002-M005-NAT1b).

In addition to the pressures addressed for all species groups (e.g. impacts on habitats, and litter) reported for all species groups, France also reports a measure addressing the pressure ‘by-catch’ caused by fisheries (M008-NAT1b) and an additional measure protecting mammal habitats (M001-2NAT1b).

In addition to the pressures addressed for most species groups in the North East Atlantic (e.g. impacts on habitats, physical loss, physical damage and litter), France states that it covers extraction of species caused by fisheries (M008-NAT1b) and includes additional measures addressing physical damage caused by sediment extraction and fisheries (M224-NAT1a, M221-NAT1a). It also includes a measure to address litter caused by aquaculture (M304-MMN1b). Therefore, the pressures are addressed.

In addition to the pressures addressed for all species groups (e.g. impacts on habitats, physical loss, physical damage and litter), France reports a number of pressures for seabed habitats in the North East Atlantic. These cover extraction of species caused by fisheries (M008-NAT1b), impacts on seabed habitats (M001-5NAT1b), physical loss caused by mooring and anchoring (e.g. M227-NAT1a), physical damage caused by the extraction of sediment (024-NAT1b, M025-ATL2), dredging and disposal (M024-NAT1b, M014-NAT2), aquaculture (M222-NAT1a) and fisheries (M221-NAT1a). France also addresses longitudinal continuity (M005_KTM1b) and litter inputs from aquaculture (M304-MMN1b). Furthermore, recreational activities are covered by measures that aim to reduce impacts from mooring of yachts and measures that foresee impact assessments before granting permits for public sports events in the marine environment. 
In the NEA, under Article 8, France reports ‘physical loss’ and ‘physical damage’ as pressures in all three subregions. In the North Sea and Bay of Biscay, France reports various activities that are responsible for physical loss such as dredging, aquaculture, land claim/coastal defence, port operations, submarine cables and pipeline operations, and solid waste disposal. Fisheries, seaweed harvesting, marine mining, dredging, submarine cables/pipeline operations and tourism have been mentioned as causes of physical damage. In the Celtic Seas, France reports seaweed harvesting, submarine cables/pipeline operation and land claim/coastal defence in the case of physical loss, as well as fisheries, seaweed harvesting, submarine cables/pipeline operations and research for physical damage. France addresses these pressures through its measures, which tackle most of the activities reported in Article 8 and listed above. France has clarified that in the Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay, coastal defence and port operations are addressed by D7 measures, while research and seaweed harvesting are addressed by D3 measures. As such, pressures are addressed in these two subregions. Nevertheless, in the North Sea, coastal defence, port operations and seaweed harvesting do not appear to be addressed, as such pressures are partially addressed in this subregion.

Water column habitats: Water column habitat pressures are partially addressed. The measures address pressures caused by fisheries in both subregions. Furthermore, aspects such as NIS, eutrophication and contaminants, are at least partially addressed via measures reported in D2, D5 and D8 (which are assessed in their respective sections of this report). 

Seabed habitats: The measures address pressures in the Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay; they partially address pressures in the North Sea and Western Mediterranean. A large number of activities are addressed by the measures reported by France: dredging, aquaculture, land claim/coastal defence, port operations, submarine cables and pipeline operations, and solid waste disposal; in addition to mooring and anchoring from recreational activities in the Mediterranean. In the North Sea, land claim/coastal defence, port operations, research and seaweed harvesting (reported as relevant by France in Article 8) do not appear to be addressed.

For the Mediterranean, France does not report any specific water column species measure but rather, includes measures addressing mainly other species but which also have an effect on this species group. The reported measures address extraction of species caused by fisheries (M008-NAT1b). Other aspects such as NIS, eutrophication and contaminants are not directly addressed under this biodiversity descriptor, but are likely to at least be partially addressed via measures reported under D2, D5 and D8. Therefore, the pressures are partially covered. 

At a regional level, France links measures M206-NAT1a and M007-NAT1b on lists of endangered species and habitats to its obligations under OSPAR and the Barcelona Convention for D1, 4 Water column.

In the Mediterranean, France covers a large number of pressures for seabed habitats. It addresses the pressure ‘physical damage’ caused by a range of activities, such as recreational activities (M003-MED1a), mooring and anchoring (M007-MED1a, M030-MED2, M033-34MED2), dredging and disposal (M019-MED1a, M024-NAT1b, M031-MED2), fisheries (M038-MED1b) and non-reported activities (M008-MED1a, M015-MED1a). France also addresses physical loss caused by mooring and anchoring (M007-MED1a), fisheries (M038-MED1b, although it should be noted that the spatial scope for this measure is limited as it does not go beyond 12nm) and non-reported activities (M008-MED1a, M015-MED1a). France includes the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by fisheries through its PoM (M010-MED1a, M020-MED1a, M008-NAT1b). A number of spatial protection measures will address various impacts on seabed habitats, for which activities have not been reported (including M001-MED1a, M017-MED1a, M037-MED2). Also, natural erosion and anthropogenic construction impacts are addressed by the measures (M014-MED1a). France states that it covers the pressure ‘contamination’ caused by industry (M018-MED1a), and dredging and disposal (M024-NAT1b) activity. It also includes measures to address the pressures ‘hydromorphological changes’ and ‘longitudinal continuity’ caused by various activities, including construction and dam-building (M013-MED1a M005_KTM1b).

At the subregional level, France reports physical damage and loss as relevant pressures for its waters in its Article 8 reporting. Aquaculture, land claim, port operations, submarine cable and solid waste disposal have been reported as activities leading to physical loss, while fisheries, marine mining, dredging, submarine cable, tourism and offshore structures have been associated with physical damage. Even though France covers the relevant pressures, the measures reported for this descriptor do not cover some activities such as marine mining, submarine cables, aquaculture and port operations. These are likely to be at least partially addressed by measures from other descriptors, but given the information reported this is not clear.

HR ;MED ;13;D1-F;Coverage of pressures;"Croatia identified the extraction of species by commercial fisheries as the main and most direct pressure on fish, affecting non-commercial species in the form of incidental catches (bycatch). This is directly addressed by the measures, which offer spatial, temporal and technical (fishing gear) restrictions to protect these populations. Two measures are reported on strengthening aquaculture and mitigating climate change impacts in this sector, which aim to increase the productivity of fish farms and reduce dependence on commercial fisheries and thus reduce the required fishing effort and its associated bycatch. 

NIS introductions, broadly considered as one of the pressures likely to have the most critical impact on native fauna, are addressed mainly through shipping and aquaculture activities. However, the PoM also includes early NIS detection and direct removal from the environment where this is economically feasible. On NIS direct removal, the PoM also includes a measure on adapting fishing gear to include NIS species within the stocks targeted by commercial fisheries.

Nutrients input (eutrophication) and contamination from several sea-based and land-based activities, potentially affecting relevant spawning, breeding or feeding areas for fish and cephalopods, are also addressed. 

Marine litter is directly addressed, with measures covering the removal of abandoned fishing gear, thereby reducing the impact of ghost fishing.

HR ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Croatia identifies nutrient enrichment as the main pressure on water column habitats. Aquaculture and shipping are directly addressed. The PoM also includes measures addressing both nutrient enrichment and contamination from several land-based and sea-based activities within the framework of the WFD and spatial protection schemes. NIS introductions are addressed by measures tackling aquaculture and shipping, while another measure (M003-KTM34) aims to reduce NIS penetration and general impacts rather than any specific activity. Marine litter is addressed by two measures relevant for all species and habitats groups, also tackling microplastics.

The PoM includes two new measures indirectly addressing nutrient enrichment from aquaculture by means of a strengthened and centralised monitoring scheme, and NIS introductions at ports by the establishment of regular control surveys. Changes on hydrological processes are prevented by a measure tackling water-related construction on coastal locations.

Overall, the PoM addresses all relevant pressures.

In its Article 8 reporting, Croatia identified physical loss and damage as relevant pressures for seabed habitats. It reported land claim and coastal defence, port operations and submarine cables as sources of physical loss, as well as fisheries (including recreational), and seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting as activities causing physical damage.
Land claim and coastal defence, as well as port operations, are addressed by a descriptor-specific measure on EIA for ‘water works’, dealing with impacts due to hydrographical changes caused by water-related infrastructure, and also by horizontal measures on MSP and SEA. While not directly mentioned by these measures, the installation of submarine cables is likely to be addressed.
Fisheries are widely addressed by general measures for biodiversity reducing overall fishing effort, and also by a new measure specifically banning trawling activities on coralligenous beds. Still, no additional seabed habitats seem to be covered by the measures. Therefore, the widespread damage from bottom trawling is only partially covered. 
In addition to the activities identified in its Article 8 reporting, the measures reported as relevant for seabed habitats address contamination, nutrient enrichment and NIS introductions. Anchoring impacts from tourism and recreation activities (including yachting) are also addressed. Dredging is covered by the prohibition of the exploitation of coastal sandbars. Shipping and related NIS introductions are addressed by a measure focusing on the implementation of the Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments.
Seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting is not directly addressed by any measure, although the activity might be regulated by measures on MSP or, at least, restricted in MPAs. However, this cannot be confirmed from the information provided by Croatia. 

Therefore, the PoM only partially addresses pressures on seabed habitats.

At subregional level, the neighbouring countries in the Adriatic Sea reported tourism (Greece and Slovenia), land claim/coastal defence (all Member States) and port operations (Italy and Slovenia) as the main sources of physical loss, and fisheries (all Member States), land claim/coastal defence and port operations (Italy and Slovenia) as the main activities responsible for causing physical damage, all of which are addressed by Croatia to some extent.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives concerns seafloor integrity: ‘Sea‐floor integrity is maintained, especially in priority benthic habitats’ (with associated operational objectives and indicators). The Plan Bleu Regional Activity Centre (one of the six UNEP/MAP Regional Advisory Centres) explains that, despite efforts, the Mediterranean Sea still faces several pressures, among which are the fishing methods destroying or disturbing the seafloor (as shown in the FP7 Benthis project and JRC Blue hub). At the very least, fisheries play a role in physical losses and damage to the Mediterranean Sea. Croatia covers fishing impacts on seabed habitats in its measures but only to some extent. As explained above, only one habitat type seems to be covered by the measures (Corallium rubrum is specifically mentioned), which is not sufficient to address the overall damage caused by bottom trawling. 
";"Water column habitats: Pressures for water column habitats are addressed. The PoM covers all of the relevant activities likely to cause impacts, including nutrient enrichment, contamination, NIS and marine litter.  

Seabed habitats: Pressures are partially addressed. Physical loss and damage from land claim, coastal defence, port operations, submarine cable, dredging and tourism are addressed, as well as NIS introductions from shipping and aquaculture. It should still be noted that most of these activities occur in the coastal areas. As such, the measures covering them address a very narrow strip of coastal zone, not the overall impact of activities on the marine environment. Also, fisheries restrictions only concern one habitat type (coralligenous beds; Corallium rubrum is specifically mentioned) and the widespread damage from bottom trawling is only partially covered by the measures. Nutrient enrichment and contamination are addressed in a transversal manner. Seaweed harvesting, identified by Croatia as a relevant source of physical damage, is not addressed by the PoM.";2;"Addressed (water column habitats)

HR ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"GES defined by Croatia for water column habitats includes the maintenance of the taxonomic biodiversity and abundance of plankton communities in line with the natural biotic and abiotic conditions. The reported measures will help to conserve natural conditions by tackling all relevant pressures likely to impact or alter those conditions. For food webs (D4), this definition is broadened by the inclusion of the maintenance of full reproductive capacity of the communities. While measures do not address reproductive capacity, it is assumed that by preserving natural conditions, the reproductive capacity will be similarly maintained.

Targets include the maintenance of the relative abundance of plankton communities according to natural conditions, preventing the alteration of the structure or functioning of the food web. Some very specific targets on water column habitat species are included, such as ‘Dominance of crustacean over gelatinous component in mesozooplankton’ or ‘Copepod abundances within normal ranges and stable on multiannual scale’. While the PoM does not directly address these targets, the reported measures can significantly reduce impacts that may threaten the natural conditions, thereby contributing to achieving these targets.

The PoM addresses GES and targets for water column habitats, based on the fact that the main pressures on water column habitats are addressed.

Croatia’s GES definition includes references to the maintenance of the distribution range and ecological status of algal communities (Cystoseira amantacea), Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows, and coralligenous habitats (Corallium rubrum). GES for seabed habitats (D1, 4, 6) is defined as soft and hard bottoms and Posidonia meadows not adversely affected by human activities. Measures reported by Croatia for seabed habitats (including horizontal measures and the measures reported under the ICZM protocol) provide some protection from the main impacts on seabed habitats, thus partially addressing the possible threats to their ecological status. However, the measures appear to be focused on protecting only certain specific habitats and do not address the wider range of seabed habitats included in the GES determination (e.g. it is not clear whether or not Cystoseira amantacea is covered). The measures also include mapping efforts to increase knowledge of their distribution, which will likely improve the efficiency of efforts to protect these habitats.

Targets aim to increase the number and density of adult specimens of red coral (Corallium rubrum), and to set minimum Favourable Reference Ranges (Habitats Directive) for photophilic algae (focusing again on Cystoseira amantacea), Posidonia oceanica and coral beds. These elements are addressed in a general manner by measures intended to lower the pressures affecting them. The ecological quality of these habitats within the WFD areas is also set as a target, which is directly tackled by WFD-related measures.

Another target links the good ecological status of benthic communities (including soft and hard bottoms) and biocenosis distribution (linked to bottom trawler activity) which is partially addressed by measure M002-KTM26.

Therefore, the PoM only partially addresses GES and targets for seabed habitats.
";"Water column habitats: GES and targets are addressed. Although measures do not refer to the specific targets provided, they do conserve natural conditions by tackling several pressures and activities, which will ensure their achievement.

HR ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Croatia identified the extraction of species by commercial fisheries as the main and most direct pressure on fish, affecting non-commercial species in the form of incidental catches (bycatch). This is directly addressed by the measures, which offer spatial, temporal and technical (fishing gear) restrictions to protect these populations. Two measures are reported on strengthening aquaculture and mitigating climate change impacts in this sector, which aim to increase the productivity of fish farms and reduce dependence on commercial fisheries and thus reduce the required fishing effort and its associated bycatch. 

NIS introductions, broadly considered as one of the pressures likely to have the most critical impact on native fauna, are addressed mainly through shipping and aquaculture activities. However, the PoM also includes early NIS detection and direct removal from the environment where this is economically feasible. On NIS direct removal, the PoM also includes a measure on adapting fishing gear to include NIS species within the stocks targeted by commercial fisheries.

Nutrients input (eutrophication) and contamination from several sea-based and land-based activities, potentially affecting relevant spawning, breeding or feeding areas for fish and cephalopods, are also addressed. 

Marine litter is directly addressed, with measures covering the removal of abandoned fishing gear, thereby reducing the impact of ghost fishing. 

Overall, the PoM addresses pressures on fish and cephalopods.

At regional level, Croatia links its measures for fish and cephalopods to the Barcelona Convention.

Impacts on marine mammal and reptile populations and their habitats from fishing activities, including bycatch, are directly addressed by several measures, dealing with both spatio-temporal and technical (fishing gear) restrictions. Nutrients input and contamination from various activities are also addressed by measures relevant for all biodiversity species groups and habitats. These measures will prevent impacts on marine mammal and reptile habitats and on their food chains. Marine litter is also tackled by measures addressing all species groups and habitats, which will enable a general reduction in litter volumes in the sea, avoiding its ingestion by mammals and reptiles. The removal of abandoned fishing gear will also reduce animal mortality.

Underwater noise, while identified as a pressure, is only indirectly addressed by measures to strengthen monitoring efforts. These measures will increase knowledge of underwater noise levels and its impact on these animals. However, they will not lead to any immediate reduction of this pressure on mammals and reptiles. Mortality of mammals and reptiles due to collisions with vessels was neither identified as relevant nor addressed.

Therefore, pressures on mammals and reptiles are partially addressed by the PoM.

At regional level, Croatia links its PoM for mammals and reptiles to the Barcelona Convention and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic areas (ACCOBAMS).";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Fish and cephalopods: The pressures are addressed, as extraction of species caused by fisheries is covered, ghost fishing is reduced, as well as impacts from NIS introductions, contamination, eutrophication and marine litter from several activities.

Mammals and reptiles: Pressures for mammals and reptiles are partially addressed. Incidental bycatch from fisheries, in addition to impacts from contamination and marine litter, are addressed. Mortality and injury to cetaceans from collisions with ships and underwater noise are not covered (except through monitoring efforts).";3;Addressed (Fish and cephalopod);https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/bba54ea1-d487-4b25-b8b3-250443378327/details
HR ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 

Croatia’s GES definition for fish and cephalopods includes the prevention of impacts from human activities onto spatial distribution, population health and composition of fish communities. While the PoM refers to ‘selected’ or ‘sensitive’ species within these indicators, it does not specify the species to which it refers. Non-commercial species are considered within several measures, which include the reduction of bycatch as the most direct impact, as well as different fishing restrictions and the reduction of other pressures such as NIS or threats to water quality. These measures will reduce human impacts on fish populations, improving their health.

For targets, a reference is also made to ‘selected’ or ‘sensitive’ species, without clarifying the targets to which they refer. Croatia aims to meet species indicators on population abundance density and biomass, demographic characteristics, as well as geographical and depth distributions. However, these indicators are not developed, nor linked to any RSC or regulation, making it impossible to assess their achievement or progress. Targets for food webs include achieving long-term biomass stability and maintaining species composition and condition for small pelagic fish and top predators. The reported measures provide a general protection framework which should be sufficient to achieve these targets.

Overall, the PoM addresses GES and targets for fish and cephalopods. However, it should be noted that the ‘selected’ and ‘sensitive’ species referred to in the GES and targets definitions are not further specified (no detail is given on these species), which makes it impossible to assess whether or not the measures will specifically address and protect these species. 

Croatia defines GES for mammals and reptiles by addressing the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) and ‘monitored cetaceans’, without further specifying which species. The GES definition also mentions other elements, such as achieving stable species distributions, population size, and low mortality rates linked to bycatch or litter ingestion (this latter is considered solely for turtles).

Targets also address the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) and include a reference to the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). The indicators focus on the distribution range for ‘monitored’ cetaceans, population size of bottlenose dolphins and reduction of turtle mortality due to bycatch and litter ingestion. One target also deals with top predators’ biomass stability, which, for mammals, is likely linked to dolphins, although they are not specifically mentioned.

Measures reported for mammals and reptiles do not link to GES or targets indicators and, although they cover most relevant pressures, they omit collisions and underwater noise (which is only indirectly addressed by monitoring efforts), both of which are important. These pressures represent an important threat to the distribution of mammal populations, in particular, which may be affected by unmanaged intense maritime traffic. It is possible that these pressures are addressed by measures defined under other descriptors, but no link has been provided in the measures reported for mammals and reptiles. Therefore, the PoM only partially addresses GES and targets.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 

Fish and cephalopods: GES and targets are addressed. Even though Croatia refers to ‘sensitive’ or ‘selected’ species for defining GES and targets, without naming species, the reported measures cover non-commercial species and their habitats through several fishing restrictions (among other measures), providing a protective framework for the achievement of GES and targets.

Mammals and reptiles: GES and targets are partially addressed. Although the measures do not specifically link to the indicators reported by Croatia, most of the relevant activities are covered. However, the omission of underwater noise and collisions may jeopardise the achievement of GES and targets.";2;Partially addressed (mammals and reptiles);https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/bba54ea1-d487-4b25-b8b3-250443378327/details

HR ;MED ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Croatia identifies nutrient enrichment as the main pressure on water column habitats. Aquaculture and shipping are directly addressed. The PoM also includes measures addressing both nutrient enrichment and contamination from several land-based and sea-based activities within the framework of the WFD and spatial protection schemes. NIS introductions are addressed by measures tackling aquaculture and shipping, while another measure (M003-KTM34) aims to reduce NIS penetration and general impacts rather than any specific activity. Marine litter is addressed by two measures relevant for all species and habitats groups, also tackling microplastics.

The PoM includes two new measures indirectly addressing nutrient enrichment from aquaculture by means of a strengthened and centralised monitoring scheme, and NIS introductions at ports by the establishment of regular control surveys. Changes on hydrological processes are prevented by a measure tackling water-related construction on coastal locations.

Overall, the PoM addresses all relevant pressures.

In its Article 8 reporting, Croatia identified physical loss and damage as relevant pressures for seabed habitats. It reported land claim and coastal defence, port operations and submarine cables as sources of physical loss, as well as fisheries (including recreational), and seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting as activities causing physical damage.
Land claim and coastal defence, as well as port operations, are addressed by a descriptor-specific measure on EIA for ‘water works’, dealing with impacts due to hydrographical changes caused by water-related infrastructure, and also by horizontal measures on MSP and SEA. While not directly mentioned by these measures, the installation of submarine cables is likely to be addressed.
Fisheries are widely addressed by general measures for biodiversity reducing overall fishing effort, and also by a new measure specifically banning trawling activities on coralligenous beds. Still, no additional seabed habitats seem to be covered by the measures. Therefore, the widespread damage from bottom trawling is only partially covered. 
In addition to the activities identified in its Article 8 reporting, the measures reported as relevant for seabed habitats address contamination, nutrient enrichment and NIS introductions. Anchoring impacts from tourism and recreation activities (including yachting) are also addressed. Dredging is covered by the prohibition of the exploitation of coastal sandbars. Shipping and related NIS introductions are addressed by a measure focusing on the implementation of the Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments.
Seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting is not directly addressed by any measure, although the activity might be regulated by measures on MSP or, at least, restricted in MPAs. However, this cannot be confirmed from the information provided by Croatia. 

Therefore, the PoM only partially addresses pressures on seabed habitats.

At subregional level, the neighbouring countries in the Adriatic Sea reported tourism (Greece and Slovenia), land claim/coastal defence (all Member States) and port operations (Italy and Slovenia) as the main sources of physical loss, and fisheries (all Member States), land claim/coastal defence and port operations (Italy and Slovenia) as the main activities responsible for causing physical damage, all of which are addressed by Croatia to some extent.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives concerns seafloor integrity: ‘Sea‐floor integrity is maintained, especially in priority benthic habitats’ (with associated operational objectives and indicators). The Plan Bleu Regional Activity Centre (one of the six UNEP/MAP Regional Advisory Centres) explains that, despite efforts, the Mediterranean Sea still faces several pressures, among which are the fishing methods destroying or disturbing the seafloor (as shown in the FP7 Benthis project and JRC Blue hub). At the very least, fisheries play a role in physical losses and damage to the Mediterranean Sea. Croatia covers fishing impacts on seabed habitats in its measures but only to some extent. As explained above, only one habitat type seems to be covered by the measures (Corallium rubrum is specifically mentioned), which is not sufficient to address the overall damage caused by bottom trawling. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: Pressures for water column habitats are addressed. The PoM covers all of the relevant activities likely to cause impacts, including nutrient enrichment, contamination, NIS and marine litter.  

Seabed habitats: Pressures are partially addressed. Physical loss and damage from land claim, coastal defence, port operations, submarine cable, dredging and tourism are addressed, as well as NIS introductions from shipping and aquaculture. It should still be noted that most of these activities occur in the coastal areas. As such, the measures covering them address a very narrow strip of coastal zone, not the overall impact of activities on the marine environment. Also, fisheries restrictions only concern one habitat type (coralligenous beds; Corallium rubrum is specifically mentioned) and the widespread damage from bottom trawling is only partially covered by the measures. Nutrient enrichment and contamination are addressed in a transversal manner. Seaweed harvesting, identified by Croatia as a relevant source of physical damage, is not addressed by the PoM.";2;"Addressed (water column habitats)

HR ;MED ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
GES defined by Croatia for water column habitats includes the maintenance of the taxonomic biodiversity and abundance of plankton communities in line with the natural biotic and abiotic conditions. The reported measures will help to conserve natural conditions by tackling all relevant pressures likely to impact or alter those conditions. For food webs (D4), this definition is broadened by the inclusion of the maintenance of full reproductive capacity of the communities. While measures do not address reproductive capacity, it is assumed that by preserving natural conditions, the reproductive capacity will be similarly maintained.

Targets include the maintenance of the relative abundance of plankton communities according to natural conditions, preventing the alteration of the structure or functioning of the food web. Some very specific targets on water column habitat species are included, such as ‘Dominance of crustacean over gelatinous component in mesozooplankton’ or ‘Copepod abundances within normal ranges and stable on multiannual scale’. While the PoM does not directly address these targets, the reported measures can significantly reduce impacts that may threaten the natural conditions, thereby contributing to achieving these targets.

The PoM addresses GES and targets for water column habitats, based on the fact that the main pressures on water column habitats are addressed.

Croatia’s GES definition includes references to the maintenance of the distribution range and ecological status of algal communities (Cystoseira amantacea), Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows, and coralligenous habitats (Corallium rubrum). GES for seabed habitats (D1, 4, 6) is defined as soft and hard bottoms and Posidonia meadows not adversely affected by human activities. Measures reported by Croatia for seabed habitats (including horizontal measures and the measures reported under the ICZM protocol) provide some protection from the main impacts on seabed habitats, thus partially addressing the possible threats to their ecological status. However, the measures appear to be focused on protecting only certain specific habitats and do not address the wider range of seabed habitats included in the GES determination (e.g. it is not clear whether or not Cystoseira amantacea is covered). The measures also include mapping efforts to increase knowledge of their distribution, which will likely improve the efficiency of efforts to protect these habitats.

Targets aim to increase the number and density of adult specimens of red coral (Corallium rubrum), and to set minimum Favourable Reference Ranges (Habitats Directive) for photophilic algae (focusing again on Cystoseira amantacea), Posidonia oceanica and coral beds. These elements are addressed in a general manner by measures intended to lower the pressures affecting them. The ecological quality of these habitats within the WFD areas is also set as a target, which is directly tackled by WFD-related measures.

Another target links the good ecological status of benthic communities (including soft and hard bottoms) and biocenosis distribution (linked to bottom trawler activity) which is partially addressed by measure M002-KTM26.

Therefore, the PoM only partially addresses GES and targets for seabed habitats.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: GES and targets are addressed. Although measures do not refer to the specific targets provided, they do conserve natural conditions by tackling several pressures and activities, which will ensure their achievement.

However, they might not cover the wider range of seabed habitats included in the GES determination (e.g. it is not clear whether or not Cystoseira amantacea is covered).

IE ;ATL ;13;D1-B;Coverage of pressures;"Ireland aims to reduce pressures on bird ecosystems and habitats by addressing fisheries activities (M020, M063, M212) and those activities that might introduce Non-Indigenous Species (M021). This pressure is reportedly addressed through a number of measures, the detail of whose activities is not described (M001, M003, M005, M007, M008, M016-19, M022-25, M061, M063, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133). Most of these measures link to the implementation of national or EU legislation, as they link for example to the application of the Birds and Habitats Directives (M001) and cover the protection if migratory water bird species (M025). 

Ireland addresses the extraction of species, either through bird-hunting activities (M027, M028, M030- M032) or accidental by-catch occurring during fishing activities (M022, M098, M212, M220). Extraction of species is also addressed by measures for which activities have not been specified (M124, M128, M129, M133). These measures for example link to the appropriate application of national licensing regulation for marine activities (M124) and river basin and shoreline management plans (M129).

The pressure ‘biological disturbance’ is addressed in the PoM by measures on fisheries activities (M020, M084, M212, M220), activities that might cause the introduction of Non-Indigenous Species (M021), hunting activities (M027, M028, M030-M032), wildlife watching (M034) and various other activities, such as pile driving and seismic surveys (M033). A number of measures within the PoM reportedly address this pressure, although the relevant activities are not described (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M018, M022-M025, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133, M212, M220). These measures link, among other things, to SPAs under the Birds Directive (M001, M006) in addition to spatial protection measures under the Habitats Directive (M003) and other national legislation.

Two measures address contamination – including that of bird habitats - through the use of pesticides (M139), accidental pollution caused by marine operations (M157), offshore oil and gas production (M125) and non-reported activities (M124, M128, M129, M133). As an example, measure M133 covers that environmental monitoring measures are fit for purpose.

For example, these measures link to continued implementation of OSPAR recommendations for Threatened and/or Declining habitats and species (M008) and the application of the national Responsibly Sourced Standard for wild capture fisheries.

Two measures addressing all species cover contamination through the use of use of pesticides (M139), accidental pollution caused by marine operations (M157), offshore oil and gas production (M125) and non-reported activities (M124, M128, M129, M133).

Ireland addresses biological disturbance of marine mammals caused by fisheries (M084. M018, M059, M026, M212, M220), wildlife watching (M034), illegal hunting (M031), or unreported activities (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M024, M032, M029, M030, M035, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133, M212, M220). These measures address for example licensing processes for disturbances of protected plant and animal species.

It also aims to reduce underwater noise resulting from various activities, such as pile driving and seismic survey (M033), through its measures.

Two measures addressing all species cover contamination through the use of use of pesticides (M139), accidental pollution caused by marine operations (M157), offshore oil and gas production (M125) and non-reported activities (M124, M128, M129, M133). The latter address for example the implementation of river basin and shoreline management plans. Contamination for mammals can be an issue as the contaminants can accumulate along the food chain and consequently lead to higher concentrations in marine mammals.

IE ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Most pressures are addressed by measures for fisheries impacts or measures whose activities are not described. Overall impacts on water column habitats are addressed (M001, M003, M005, M007, M008, M016-M019, M024, M061, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133), as are those stemming from biological disturbance (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M024, M084, M018, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133, M212, M220) and contamination (M139, M157, M008, M124, M125, M128, M128, M129, M133). Again, most of these measures link to the implementation of EU or national legislations, such as the Habitats Directive, legislation on licensing and river basin and shoreline management plans. Pressures from marine litter may be addressed by M221, although the description of the measure does not provide enough details on what is exactly being covered. It is not clear whether water column habitats are directly addressed by these measures, as there is insufficient detail to allow a full assessment. Furthermore, no measures have been reported that specifically address water column species such as zooplankton or phytoplankton. Therefore, pressures on water column habitats are partially addressed by Ireland’s PoM.

At the regional level, Ireland links its obligations under OSPAR to the group of measures reported for water column.

Ireland reports that it addresses the pressure ‘physical loss’ caused by fisheries (M084, M059), even though trawl fishing is only regulated within special closing areas or seasonally. Dredging and disposal activities (M177), oil and gas operations (M067) and non-reported activities (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M024) are also covered. The pressure ‘physical damage’ is addressed by measures to reduce and manage impacts from wild capture fisheries (M212), dredging and disposal activities (M068, M177), dumping at sea (M158), offshore oil and gas operations (M067), various, unspecified, marine operations (M157) or unreported activities (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M024, M084, M059). These measures mostly link to the implementation of the Habitats Directive (M001, M003) and other EU and national legislation.

Ireland addresses the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by fisheries (M084, M032, M044, M052, M053, M059, M107, M108, M020, M212, M220), or by unreported activities (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M018, M024, M124, M128, M129, M133). The measures link, inter alia, to the setting up of functional zones for fish (M01) and the application of the Wildlife Acts (M024), and cover, to some extent, trawling impacts from bottom fishing gear. 

Different types of contamination are addressed by measures to reduce or manage the use of pesticides (M139), various, unspecified activities causing accidental pollution (M157), offshore oil and gas operations (M067, M125), dumping at sea (M158), dredging and disposal activities (M068, M149, M177), and unreported activities (M124, M128, M129, M133). The unreported activities link, inter alia, to the implementation of national legislation of licensing processes (M124) and the application of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive.
Ireland states that it addresses the pressure ‘marine litter’ insofar as it is caused by aquaculture (M221) and unreported activities (M227).

At the regional level, Ireland highlights the pressure ‘physical loss’ which its Article 8 reporting identified as relevant for its waters. It identifies the role played by activities, such as marine hydrocarbon extraction, dredging, the placement and operation of offshore structures, land claim and coastal defence and submarine cable and pipeline laying in causing this pressure. A number of the Irish PoM measures either link directly to these measures or address EIA for marine activities, thus likely covering these measures. At the subregional level, like other Member States of the Celtic Seas sub-region, Ireland identified similar activities as relevant for causing the pressure, in addition to port operations, which are likely to be covered through measures addressing dredging and port operations. 

Ireland also reports physical damage as a relevant pressure for its Article 8 reporting, identifying wild capture fisheries, aquaculture and land claim and coastal defence as relevant factors in the creation of this pressure. While fisheries activities are covered overall, bottom fishing is partially addressed by the PoM. Aquaculture is covered by specific measures and land claim and coastal defence activities might be addressed by the general measures. Other Member States of the Celtic Seas sub-region identified fisheries as a relevant activity for causing this pressure, which is also covered by Ireland. 

At the regional level, Ireland links its obligations under OSPAR to the measures in its seabed habitat PoM.";"Water column habitats: Water column habitat pressures are partially addressed, because contaminants are covered by the D8 measures, but no specific nutrient enrichment measure has been linked to these habitats. Furthermore, Ireland does not specifically mention phytoplankton and zooplankton species in its PoM. 

Seabed habitats: The reported groups of measures partially address pressures, as Ireland does not report measures on addressing the activity of seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting causing physical damage, which was reported as relevant under article 8. Physical damage originating from fisheries has been reported to be covered through one measure, which is likely to not be sufficient to address the pressure. Compared to other Celtic Sea Member States, Ireland does not identify the activities submarine cables and land claim and coastal defence as factors in physical damage and does not report measures for these activities, despite the incidence of such activities in Irish waters.";2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/75bfb361-3d00-4b5a-afa0-d5286511f6d1/details
IE ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"As indicated for the species groups above, Ireland does not specifically define GES for water column habitats, but defines a general GES for its biodiversity descriptors, linking to abundance, species distribution and their habitats. These aspects are likely to be partially addressed for water column habitats, as even though no water column habitat-specific measure has been reported, Ireland addresses impacts on these habitats through contaminants. Again, the effectiveness of measures and whether GES and targets will be achieved by 2020 cannot be assessed, as the information reported by Ireland is not detailed enough to allow for an assessment in this regard.

Ireland reports no targets for water column habitats, making an assessment of targets impossible. 

In addition to the generic GES definition for descriptors 1 and 4, Ireland also reports a general descriptor 6 definition, linking to sea-floor integrity, ecosystem functioning and the protection of benthic ecosystems. Even though impact on the seabed from fishing activities is the main threat to seabed integrity, the Member State reports relatively few measures addressing this issue. One measure covering physical damage from wild capture fisheries has been reported and other fisheries restriction measures apply mostly to Ireland’s few MPAs. Therefore, GES is partially addressed by the PoM.

Ireland reports two targets linked to seabed habitats, one each for descriptor 1 and descriptor 6. Both targets highlight that adverse effects resulting from specifically-attributed contaminants are below the agreed OSPAR criteria, currently set by the evaluation of reproductive impairment in marine gastropods associated with tributyltin (TBT). This target is likely addressed by the measure M139, which refers to the persistent bio-accumulative toxic properties of pesticides.
";"Water column habitats: Ireland does not present water column-specific measures, however, reports other measures which will contribute to GES for these habitats. Therefore, the measures partially address GES.

IE ;ATL ;13;D4;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Most measures reported for D1, 4 – Fish address the pressure extraction of species caused by fisheries (M030-M032, M041-M059, M063, M064, M084, M087, M093, M098, M101, M102, M212, M220). For a number of measures the addressed activity has not been reported, although it is likely that they also link to fisheries (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M018, M024, M124, M128, M129, M133, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133). These measures link, for example, to the setting up of MPAs in functional zones for fish (M018) and the continued application of the Wildlife Acts (M024).

Ireland’s measures also address impacts of fisheries’ activities on marine fish ecosystems and habitats (M061, M063, M058, M059, M063, M101, M102, M212). Again, this pressure is addressed by a number of measures for which activities have not been reported (M001-M005, M007, M008, M016-M019, M024m M124, M125, M128, M129, M133). Measures address, inter alia, the application of Appropriate Assessment of activities within Natura sites as required by the Habitats Directive (M005). 

The PoM addresses biological disturbance for fish caused by fisheries (M018, M024, M046, M058, M059, M084, M030-M032, M212, M220) and other non-reported activities (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133, M212, M220). For example, these measures link to continued implementation of OSPAR recommendations for Threatened and/or Declining habitats and species (M008) and the application of the national Responsibly Sourced Standard for wild capture fisheries.

Two measures addressing all species cover contamination through the use of use of pesticides (M139), accidental pollution caused by marine operations (M157), offshore oil and gas production (M125) and non-reported activities (M124, M128, M129, M133). Measures address for example the application of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and associated legislation and that it is ensured that environmental monitoring for Environmental Impact Statements are fit for purpose (M133). 

At a regional level, Ireland links its obligations under OSPAR to the group of measures reported for fish.

A large number of measures reported for mammals directly address by-catch (M084, M026, M040, M098, M031, M032, M037, M038), with some addressing the extraction of species, which also likely addresses by-catch (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M018, M024, M124, M128, M129, M133, M212, M220). Measures address for example the implementation of OSPAR recommendations for Threatened and/or Declining habitats and species (M008) and to setting up (temporary or permanent) MPAs in functional zones for fish (M018).

Ireland reports measures to ease various pressures on mammal habitats and populations caused by fisheries (M026, M061, M063, M059, M212) or other, unreported activities (M001-M005, M007, M008, M016-M019, M024, M035, M039, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133). These measures address inter alia, the designation of SACs for harbour porpoises and bottlenose dolphins (M039).

Ireland addresses biological disturbance of marine mammals caused by fisheries (M084. M018, M059, M026, M212, M220), wildlife watching (M034), illegal hunting (M031), or unreported activities (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M024, M032, M029, M030, M035, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133, M212, M220).

IE ;ATL ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Most pressures are addressed by measures for fisheries impacts or measures whose activities are not described. Overall impacts on water column habitats are addressed (M001, M003, M005, M007, M008, M016-M019, M024, M061, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133), as are those stemming from biological disturbance (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M024, M084, M018, M124, M125, M128, M129, M133, M212, M220) and contamination (M139, M157, M008, M124, M125, M128, M128, M129, M133). Again, most of these measures link to the implementation of EU or national legislations, such as the Habitats Directive, legislation on licensing and river basin and shoreline management plans. Pressures from marine litter may be addressed by M221, although the description of the measure does not provide enough details on what is exactly being covered. It is not clear whether water column habitats are directly addressed by these measures, as there is insufficient detail to allow a full assessment. Furthermore, no measures have been reported that specifically address water column species such as zooplankton or phytoplankton. Therefore, pressures on water column habitats are partially addressed by Ireland’s PoM.

At the regional level, Ireland links its obligations under OSPAR to the group of measures reported for water column.

Ireland reports that it addresses the pressure ‘physical loss’ caused by fisheries (M084, M059), even though trawl fishing is only regulated within special closing areas or seasonally. Dredging and disposal activities (M177), oil and gas operations (M067) and non-reported activities (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M024) are also covered. The pressure ‘physical damage’ is addressed by measures to reduce and manage impacts from wild capture fisheries (M212), dredging and disposal activities (M068, M177), dumping at sea (M158), offshore oil and gas operations (M067), various, unspecified, marine operations (M157) or unreported activities (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M024, M084, M059). These measures mostly link to the implementation of the Habitats Directive (M001, M003) and other EU and national legislation.

Ireland addresses the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by fisheries (M084, M032, M044, M052, M053, M059, M107, M108, M020, M212, M220), or by unreported activities (M001, M003, M005, M008, M016, M018, M024, M124, M128, M129, M133). The measures link, inter alia, to the setting up of functional zones for fish (M01) and the application of the Wildlife Acts (M024), and cover, to some extent, trawling impacts from bottom fishing gear. 

Different types of contamination are addressed by measures to reduce or manage the use of pesticides (M139), various, unspecified activities causing accidental pollution (M157), offshore oil and gas operations (M067, M125), dumping at sea (M158), dredging and disposal activities (M068, M149, M177), and unreported activities (M124, M128, M129, M133). The unreported activities link, inter alia, to the implementation of national legislation of licensing processes (M124) and the application of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive.
Ireland states that it addresses the pressure ‘marine litter’ insofar as it is caused by aquaculture (M221) and unreported activities (M227).

At the regional level, Ireland highlights the pressure ‘physical loss’ which its Article 8 reporting identified as relevant for its waters. It identifies the role played by activities, such as marine hydrocarbon extraction, dredging, the placement and operation of offshore structures, land claim and coastal defence and submarine cable and pipeline laying in causing this pressure. A number of the Irish PoM measures either link directly to these measures or address EIA for marine activities, thus likely covering these measures. At the subregional level, like other Member States of the Celtic Seas sub-region, Ireland identified similar activities as relevant for causing the pressure, in addition to port operations, which are likely to be covered through measures addressing dredging and port operations. 

Ireland also reports physical damage as a relevant pressure for its Article 8 reporting, identifying wild capture fisheries, aquaculture and land claim and coastal defence as relevant factors in the creation of this pressure. While fisheries activities are covered overall, bottom fishing is partially addressed by the PoM. Aquaculture is covered by specific measures and land claim and coastal defence activities might be addressed by the general measures. Other Member States of the Celtic Seas sub-region identified fisheries as a relevant activity for causing this pressure, which is also covered by Ireland. 

At the regional level, Ireland links its obligations under OSPAR to the measures in its seabed habitat PoM.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: Water column habitat pressures are partially addressed, because contaminants are covered by the D8 measures, but no specific nutrient enrichment measure has been linked to these habitats. Furthermore, Ireland does not specifically mention phytoplankton and zooplankton species in its PoM. 

Seabed habitats: The reported groups of measures partially address pressures, as Ireland does not report measures on addressing the activity of seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting causing physical damage, which was reported as relevant under article 8. Physical damage originating from fisheries has been reported to be covered through one measure, which is likely to not be sufficient to address the pressure. Compared to other Celtic Sea Member States, Ireland does not identify the activities submarine cables and land claim and coastal defence as factors in physical damage and does not report measures for these activities, despite the incidence of such activities in Irish waters.

IE ;ATL ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
As indicated for the species groups above, Ireland does not specifically define GES for water column habitats, but defines a general GES for its biodiversity descriptors, linking to abundance, species distribution and their habitats. These aspects are likely to be partially addressed for water column habitats, as even though no water column habitat-specific measure has been reported, Ireland addresses impacts on these habitats through contaminants. Again, the effectiveness of measures and whether GES and targets will be achieved by 2020 cannot be assessed, as the information reported by Ireland is not detailed enough to allow for an assessment in this regard.

Ireland reports no targets for water column habitats, making an assessment of targets impossible. 

In addition to the generic GES definition for descriptors 1 and 4, Ireland also reports a general descriptor 6 definition, linking to sea-floor integrity, ecosystem functioning and the protection of benthic ecosystems. Even though impact on the seabed from fishing activities is the main threat to seabed integrity, the Member State reports relatively few measures addressing this issue. One measure covering physical damage from wild capture fisheries has been reported and other fisheries restriction measures apply mostly to Ireland’s few MPAs. Therefore, GES is partially addressed by the PoM.

Ireland reports two targets linked to seabed habitats, one each for descriptor 1 and descriptor 6. Both targets highlight that adverse effects resulting from specifically-attributed contaminants are below the agreed OSPAR criteria, currently set by the evaluation of reproductive impairment in marine gastropods associated with tributyltin (TBT). This target is likely addressed by the measure M139, which refers to the persistent bio-accumulative toxic properties of pesticides.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: Ireland does not present water column-specific measures, however, reports other measures which will contribute to GES for these habitats. Therefore, the measures partially address GES. 

Seabed habitats: The measures partially ensure sea-floor integrity, ecosystem functioning and the protection of benthic ecosystems, because the measures do not cover impacts from trawl fishing sufficiently.";2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/75bfb361-3d00-4b5a-afa0-d5286511f6d1/details

Overall, Ireland considers that its measures will lead to an achievement of GES for all descriptors by 2020.

Furthermore, the designation and management of SPAs will contribute to a network of MPAs, again positively contributing to addressing the GES definition. Yet, the measures and the GES definition remain very general, and it is thus not possible to draw more detailed conclusions.  

Italy’s targets are not bird specific, but they aim to protect those species listed under the Barcelona Convention and the Birds and Habitats Directives through SPAs and SACs. They also aim to achieve and maintain the status of SPAMIs (Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance) for designated MPAs, working towards a target of MPA coverage of at least 10% of Italian waters.

IT ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Italy reports no specific biodiversity measures for water column habitats. However, it is likely that the general measures for all species groups can be considered to address this habitat. These include, spatial protection measures, together with MPA and management measures. Furthermore, measures under D2, D3, D5 and D8 will likely contribute towards a reduction of pressures for this habitat. Nevertheless, Italy does not make a link between these relevant measures and water column habitats. The related pressures are thus partially addressed. 

Italy reports one existing and one new measure for which no activities are reported which aims to reduce the impact on seabed habitats (MADIT-M006/MICIT-M006/MWEIT-M006, MADIT-M030-NEW1/MICIT-M030-NEW1/MWEIT-M033-NEW1).

A number of measures will address physical damage, although here, again, some measures do not refer to any specific human activities to be targeted (MADIT-M001-5, 13, 17, 22, 25, 27/MICIT-M001-5, 13, 17, 22, 25, 27/MWEIT-M001-5, 14, 18, 24, 28, 30). One existing measure is included that addresses hydrocarbon exploitation activities causing physical damage (MADIT-M061/MICIT-M060/MWEIT-M063). Italy reports several measures that will address fisheries activities as an underlying cause of this pressure (MADIT-M007,8, 28, 29, 45-49, 63, 64/MICIT-M007,8, 28, 29, 43-48, 62, 63/MWEIT-M007,8, 31, 32, 46-51, 65, 65, 66). However, these measures will only address these impacts in Italy’s territorial waters. 

Italy’s PoM also addresses the pressure ‘physical loss’. While some measures address this pressure, no explanation of the relevant activities is provided (MADIT-M001-5, 63/MICIT-M001-5, 62/MWEIT-M001-5). One existing measures aims to reduce the physical loss caused by hydrocarbon exploitation activities (MADIT-M059-62/MICIT-M058-61/MWEIT-M061-63). Finally, one measure is reported for each subregion that addresses dredging activities causing physical loss (MADIT-M087/MICIT- M086/MWEIT- M089). 

At the subregional level, Italy identified physical loss as a relevant pressure in all three of its subregions, pointing to the activities of land claim and coastal defence, submarine cables and port operations as underlying causes of the pressure. All of these activities have been also identified by all, or most, of the neighbouring Member States in the respective subregions. The new measure on providing guidelines for the assessment and mitigation of human impacts arising from sealing of biogenic substrates will cover most of these activities indirectly (MADIT -M065-NEW9/MICIT-M064-NEW9/MWEIT-M067-NEW9). However, Italy does not report measures that directly address the activities identified under Article 8. Therefore, pressures are partially addressed. 

For each subregion, Italy identified physical damage as a relevant pressure, highlighting the role played by fisheries, a problem echoed by neighbouring Member States. The reduction of seabed impacts from fisheries activities is only addressed by measures in territorial waters, which represents a gap in Italy’s PoM. Italy also pointed to land claim and coastal defence activities as causing physical damage in all three subregions, in addition to port operations and solid waste disposal. As for physical loss above, the new measure (NEW9) linked to providing operational guidelines for operators of various activities in the marine environment to reduce their impacts on the seabed, will address the activities indirectly. 

As some activities, which have been identified under Article 8 as relevant for causing D6 pressures are indirectly addressed, and fisheries impacts from physical damage are only addressed in territorial waters, pressures on seabed habitats are partially addressed overall. 

Italy links its measures for seabed habitat measures to the Barcelona Convention.";"Water column habitats: Even though no water column-specific measures are reported, other biodiversity measures that include MPA designations and management plans, together with measures reported under other descriptors (D2, D3, D5, D8), are likely to reduce pressures on water column habitats. Nevertheless, Italy does not make this link in the PoM.

Seabed habitats: The measures partially address the relevant pressures, as even though ‘physical loss and damage’ reported under Article 8, are covered through a number of spatial protection measures, activities such as underwater cables and pipelines, port operations, land claim and coastal defence, solid waste disposal are addressed indirectly. Furthermore, fisheries impacts are only addressed in territorial waters. .";2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/ec2fc134-5564-47ec-9983-fa893dd1d78e/details
IT ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"The GES definition does not refer specifically to water column habitats. However, the food webs (D4) GES links to trophic levels and energy transfer along the food web, which is linked to water column habitats. Italy does not make the link between this habitat type and relevant measures under biodiversity and other descriptors (D2, D3, D5, D8), which could contribute towards the achievement of GES. This is a gap and water column habitats are therefore partially addressed to support the achievement of GES. 

Similarly, as for GES, only the D4 target links specifically to water column habitats, as it aims to improve the status of individual structural components of ecosystems by 2020, through the pursuit of environmental targets identified within descriptors D1, D3, D5 and D6 in respect of planktonic communities. As Italy does not make any reference to measures under these other relevant descriptors and water column habitats, this target is partially addressed.

Italy’s GES for seabed habitats specifies that no significant alterations to seabed habitats should occur, nor any significant pressure from abrasion caused by fishing activities operating on the seabed and sealing on biogenic substrates. These two GES components are covered by the PoM, as measures addressing these pressures are reported by Italy. Spatial protection measures and those specifically addressing a wide range of seabed impacting activities, such as fishing, dredging, recreational activities, underwater construction, etc. will contribute to support the achievement of GES. However, fisheries activities will only be addressed in territorial waters. Therefore, GES is partially addressed by the measures overall. 

Italy’s D6 targets for seabed habitats focus on reducing impacts from the sealing of biogenic substrates due to anthropogenic installations, and reducing the effects of seabed-impacting fishing gear. These targets are covered by existing and new measures. The D4 target also links to improving the status of individual structural components of ecosystems by 2020, through pursuing environmental targets identified within descriptors D1, D3, D5 and D6 in respect of benthic communities. These targets will also be addressed by spatial protection measures and measures under the other descriptors of the PoM. However, as indicated before, the spatial limitation of fisheries management measures to territorial waters represents a weakness. Therefore, the measures partially address the targets for seabed habitats.
";"Water column habitats: D4 GES and targets link to this habitat. Even though Italy does not report measures for this habitat, general biodiversity measures and measures under other descriptors (D2, D3, D5, D8) will partially address GES and targets.

IT ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Italy reports a number of measures that will reduce impact on fish habitats overall, without specifying which human activities these intent  to address (MADIT-M001-6 9, 16, 18, 19, 22, 25/MICIT-M001-6, 9, 16, 18, 19, 22, 25/MWEIT-M001-6, 10, 17, 19, 20, 24, 27, 28, MADIT-M030-NEW1/MICIT-M030-NEW1/MWEIT-M033-NEW1). 

Several measures address the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by fisheries (MADIT-M007,8, 23, 24, 28, 29, 45-49, 63, 64/MICIT-M007,8, 23, 24, 28, 29, 43-48, 62, 63/MWEIT-M007,8, 25, 31, 32, 46-51, 65, 65, 66). 

One measure in each subregion will address the pressure ‘extraction of species’ for commercial purposes (MADIT-M020/MICIT-M020/MWEIT-M021).

One measure is included in the PoM that directly addresses pollution impacts on fish and cephalopods in the Western Mediterranean Sea subregion (MWEIT-M022). 

Overall, the reported measures are likely to address the key pressures on fish and cephalopods (extraction of species caused by fisheries). Furthermore, the measure will also address impacts from pollution and also impacts on fish populations and their habitats. 

At a regional level, Italy links its measures for fish and cephalopods to the Barcelona Convention and the GFCM.

Several measures, mostly linked to spatial protection, will reduce impacts on mammal and turtle habitats, overall. However, which human activities that contribute to these impacts will be addressed through these measures is not been reported (MADIT-M001-4, 9, 11-13, 18-22, 25/MICIT-M001-4, 9, 11-13, 18-22, 25/MWEIT-M001-4, 10, 12-14, 19-21, 23, 24, 27, 28, MADIT -M030-NEW1/MICIT -M030-NEW1/MWEIT-M033-NEW1). Italy includes several measures that aim to reduce marine mammal and turtle by-catch from fishing activities (MADIT-M010, 24, 26/MICIT-M010, 24, 26/MWEIT-M011, 26, 29. One measure particularly targets mammal mortality caused by collisions with shipping vessels (MADIT-M031-NEW2/MICIT -M031-NEW2/MWEIT -M034-NEW2). In addition, Italy’s PoM points to one existing measure for the Western Mediterranean Sea subregion, which aims to reduce the impact of pollution on marine mammals (MWEIT-M022). Overall, pressures causing impacts on marine mammals and reptiles are likely to be addressed by the reported measures. The PoM includes direct and indirect measures targeting these species groups and addresses several aspects such as collisions with ships, mammal and turtle incidental by-catch, in addition to impacts on their habitats, as well as impacts from pollution. 

At a regional level, Italy links its measures for mammals and reptiles to the Barcelona Convention and to ACCOBAMS.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment

IT ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
As in the case of birds, the GES definition for biodiversity is rather general and does not mention fish specifically. Nevertheless, the existing and new measures are likely to address the GES components, such as the designation and maintenance of MPAs in Italian waters to protect those fish species and habitats covered by the Habitats Directives and the Barcelona Convention. 

Italy’s PoM addresses its general targets for biodiversity, which focus on protecting those species listed under the Barcelona Convention and the Birds and Habitats Directives, and to extend its Natura 2000 Network. Italy reports one D4 target to improve the status of individual structural components of ecosystems through pursuing environmental targets identified within descriptors D1, D3, D5, D6, by 2020, covering bony fish and cartilaginous fish (T 4.1). The PoM addresses these targets through its existing and new measures on MPA designation and management of the Natura 2000 Network, in addition to the existing measures for the conservation of migratory species, the adoption of European policies, the regulation of commercial fishing and exploitation of resources, and increased monitoring of fishing fleets. One new measure aims to raise awareness among stakeholders in the commercial and recreational fishing industry in order to reduce elasmobranch mortality rates from by-catch, thus addressing target 4.1. Italy’s gap analysis identified a need to stimulate and increase sustainable practices for the exploitation of coastal fish species and to implement more rigorous management measures for fisheries control. It is unlikely that the new awareness raising measure will be sufficient to address this gap for coastal fish. As such, the PoM is likely to partially address targets for fish. 

Here, again, there is no specific reference to mammals or reptiles in the general biodiversity GES definition. However, the definition components in respect to mammals and reptiles are likely to be covered, as existing and new measures include the designation and maintenance of MPAs in Italian waters to protect mammals and reptiles, as well as the directly targeting pressures causing impacts on these species (incidental by-catch, accidental collisions with vessels, pollution). 

For mammals, Italy’s existing and new spatial protection measures are likely to address the general biodiversity targets by contributing to the MPA network and protecting those species listed under the Barcelona Convention and the Birds and Habitats Directives through SPAs and SACs, SPAMIs designations and maintenance. Italy’s D4 target to improve the status of individual structural components of ecosystems by 2020, also applies to marine mammals and reptiles (T 4.1). Italy addresses these targets through its existing and new measures on MPA designation and management of the Natura 2000 Network, in addition to a number of measures specific to marine mammals and reptiles, i.e. the regulation of incidental by-catch, the conservation of cetaceans through international agreements, coordination of the national network for marine mammal strandings, and international protection. The PoM therefore addresses mammal and reptile targets. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Fish and cephalopods: GES and targets are covered through the PoM, as the targets linked to MPA designation and bony and cartilaginous fish are addressed. However, Italy’s gap analysis identified the need for measures to better manage coastal fisheries and more rigorous fisheries controls and these are not covered by the new measures. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the GES and targets for fish and cephalopods. 

Mammals and reptiles: GES and targets are addressed, as the PoM covers measures that aim to extend the Natura 2000 Network, in addition to implementing various international agreements on marine mammal protection and by-catch measures.

Furthermore, measures under D2, D3, D5 and D8 will likely contribute towards a reduction of pressures for this habitat. Nevertheless, Italy does not make a link between these relevant measures and water column habitats. The related pressures are thus partially addressed. 

Italy reports one existing and one new measure for which no activities are reported which aims to reduce the impact on seabed habitats (MADIT-M006/MICIT-M006/MWEIT-M006, MADIT-M030-NEW1/MICIT-M030-NEW1/MWEIT-M033-NEW1).

A number of measures will address physical damage, although here, again, some measures do not refer to any specific human activities to be targeted (MADIT-M001-5, 13, 17, 22, 25, 27/MICIT-M001-5, 13, 17, 22, 25, 27/MWEIT-M001-5, 14, 18, 24, 28, 30). One existing measure is included that addresses hydrocarbon exploitation activities causing physical damage (MADIT-M061/MICIT-M060/MWEIT-M063). Italy reports several measures that will address fisheries activities as an underlying cause of this pressure (MADIT-M007,8, 28, 29, 45-49, 63, 64/MICIT-M007,8, 28, 29, 43-48, 62, 63/MWEIT-M007,8, 31, 32, 46-51, 65, 65, 66). However, these measures will only address these impacts in Italy’s territorial waters. 

Italy’s PoM also addresses the pressure ‘physical loss’. While some measures address this pressure, no explanation of the relevant activities is provided (MADIT-M001-5, 63/MICIT-M001-5, 62/MWEIT-M001-5). One existing measures aims to reduce the physical loss caused by hydrocarbon exploitation activities (MADIT-M059-62/MICIT-M058-61/MWEIT-M061-63).

All of these activities have been also identified by all, or most, of the neighbouring Member States in the respective subregions. The new measure on providing guidelines for the assessment and mitigation of human impacts arising from sealing of biogenic substrates will cover most of these activities indirectly (MADIT -M065-NEW9/MICIT-M064-NEW9/MWEIT-M067-NEW9). However, Italy does not report measures that directly address the activities identified under Article 8. Therefore, pressures are partially addressed. 

For each subregion, Italy identified physical damage as a relevant pressure, highlighting the role played by fisheries, a problem echoed by neighbouring Member States. The reduction of seabed impacts from fisheries activities is only addressed by measures in territorial waters, which represents a gap in Italy’s PoM.

However, the specific pressures and activities covered, or the ways in which they are tackled, are not detailed by the PoM.

Although the ‘Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian migratory water birds’ might cover these species, no further detail is provided. Only measures addressing bycatch directly match the GES defined by Lithuania. Impacts of oil on birds are covered, but only by an indirect measure focusing on monitoring efforts.

A single general target was defined by Lithuania, focusing on ensuring the normal functioning of marine ecosystems, maintaining diversity, abundance and distribution of marine birds, fish and other marine organisms of lower trophic levels.

The PoM includes two measures addressing this issue, one directly (M020-T6PR6) and one indirectly (M021-T6PR7). However, the vague description of the measures makes it impossible to conclude the extent to which this impact is reduced.

Apart from the measures on bycatch, Lithuania reports one measure to reduce the mortality of mammals due to anthropogenic impacts (such as pollution) by means of rescuing injured animals.

The PoM includes legislation to prevent impacts on the marine environment via EIA or MSP, however, neither the specific pressures or activities covered nor the ways in which they are tackled, are detailed in the PoM. The measures reported for biodiversity, and specifically mammals, do not address marine litter and underwater noise. In general, while some pressures are addressed by the PoM, the level of detail provided in the description of the measures is very low, leaving room for doubt on which activities are covered and to what extent.

LT ;BAL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Lithuania reports that water column habitats suffer from very high levels of eutrophication due to nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from several rivers flowing into the Curonian Lagoon that later exit to the Baltic Sea. This pressure is locally addressed by legislation on best practices in the use of fertilisers for agriculture in this area, and also by measures directly tackling the removal of nutrients from the Lagoon, either directly by removing phytoplankton, or indirectly by enlarging the areas where denitrification processes take place. 

The PoM therefore considers the nutrient inputs from agriculture as a relevant pressure on water column habitats. Two measures address this pressure in a broader scope, beyond the Curonian Lagoon: the Nitrates and Sludge Directives. However, the PoM does not provide much detail on their implementation, leaving some uncertainty on the degree of coverage of these activities regarding water column habitats. Lithuania also explains that the measures reported for D5 (objective 3) have positive impacts on D4, and potentially water column habitats.

Measures on existing legislation address nutrient inputs and contaminants from other, unspecified, sources. Given the vague content of these measures and the lack of link to the measures on contaminants (D8), it is difficult to establish the activities or areas covered. The PoM does not link any of its measures to NIS introductions regarding water column habitats.

Therefore, the PoM partially addresses pressures on water column habitats, especially due to the lack detail provided on measures addressing pressures beyond the Curonian lagoon.

In its Article 8 reporting, Lithuania identified dredging and port operations as activities causing physical loss and damage, as well as fisheries as sources of physical damage. The measures specifically addressing seabed habitats do not tackle any of these activities. Furthermore, dredging a certain area was proposed as a measure to promote denitrification (see D5 section).

The PoM includes a series of pieces of existing legislation for seabed habitats such as EIA, SEA, national resolution on regulations of areas of importance for the conservation of habitats or birds, or addressing biodiversity generally and aiming to reduce and prevent impacts from various human activities. However, the legislation and the content provided by the PoM are not sufficient to draw conclusions on either the pressures or activities covered with respect to seabed habitats. Despite the inclusion of general regulation on MSP, fisheries, biodiversity and other fields, the content of the PoM and the vague descriptions of the measures do not enable an assessment of its impact on human activities and thus its consequences for the marine environment in the form of potential reduction of pressures.

Given the lack of detail, the assessment concludes that pressures on seabed habitats are not addressed.

In the Baltic Sea, half of the Member States report physical loss from marine-based renewable energy production, while half of them also report physical damage caused by fisheries. As explained above, the measures reported by Lithuania for seabed habitats do not fully cover these activities.

At regional level, Lithuania links its biodiversity measures to HELCOM.
";"Water column habitats: pressures are partially addressed. Eutrophication in the Curonian Lagoon is addressed by preventing nutrient inputs and also by a pilot project on removing the excess of phytoplankton in the water body. Lithuania also explains that the measures reported for D5 have positive impacts on D4 (and potentially water column habitats). Existing legislation addresses nutrients and contaminants through a general approach, however, it is not clear which areas and activities are covered, apart from agriculture in the Curonian Lagoon. The measures reported for biodiversity, and specifically water column habits, do not address NIS. 

Seabed habitats: pressures are not addressed. None of the pressures identified in Article 8 reporting are directly addressed (dredging and port operations for both physical loss and damage, and fisheries for physical damage). Bottom-trawl fishing is only indirectly addressed through the monitoring of its impacts. General legislation may address other pressures and activities, however, the PoM does not specify which of these are covered.";2;Partially addressed (water column habitats) , Not addressed (seabed habitats);https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/141e1335-a7c3-4f7a-8c62-6f399ba1be01/details
LT ;BAL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"For water column habitats, Lithuania defined (for GES) two thresholds linked to the relative biomass of zooplankton: one on general zooplankton microphages, and another specifically on the Copepoda group. 

A single general target was defined by Lithuania for biodiversity, focusing on ensuring the normal functioning of marine ecosystems, maintaining diversity, abundance and distribution of marine birds, fish and other marine organisms of lower trophic levels. In these latter elements, ‘marine organisms of lower trophic levels’ should comprise phytoplankton and zooplankton, the main components of water column habitats. 

The PoM includes measures to improve the chemical quality of the water column habitats, reducing eutrophication (a link has been made with the measures reported for D5) and pollution from several human sources. However, no clear link is made from the reported measures to their effect on zooplankton populations, and there is still a large degree of uncertainty regarding which activities are covered. The measures addressing general impacts on the marine environment are also vaguely described, which makes it difficult to assess whether GES and targets for water column habitats have been fully addressed. Therefore, GES and targets for water column habitats are partially addressed.

Lithuania defined as GES for seabed habitats the maintenance of two indicators: a threshold value of ‘extent of affected seafloor’ and also a benthic quality index (BQI), both compared to reference points from previous years. Given that no impacts on seabed habitats are directly identified and tackled by the PoM, the reported measures cannot be considered to work towards the achievement of either threshold. The BQI is referenced in one of the indirect measures (M014-T5PR3), although it will not directly reduce impacts on the seafloor but only improve the information available for future evaluations.

A single general target was defined by Lithuania for biodiversity. It focuses on ensuring the normal functioning of marine ecosystems, maintaining diversity, abundance and distribution of marine birds, fish and other marine organisms of lower trophic levels. Measures focusing on monitoring will improve understandings of the functioning of seabed habitats but will not themselves work towards ensuring this functioning. 

Therefore, GES and the target for seabed habitats are not addressed by the PoM.";"Water column habitats: GES and the target are partially addressed. Measures reducing nutrient content and pollution will improve the status of water column habitats. However, there is a large degree of uncertainty regarding which human activities are covered, as well as a lack of information regarding the coverage of waters beyond the Curonian Lagoon. Also, no clear link is made from the reported measures to their effect on zooplankton populations. The measures addressing general impacts on the marine environment are also vaguely described.

Seabed habitats: GES and the target are not addressed. The two indicators used by Lithuania to define GES are directly related to impacts on seabed habitats from human activities, which are not covered by the measures.

LT ;BAL ;13;D4;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Bycatch of non-commercial species is mentioned in a measure focusing on the improvement of supervision of fishing ships that will better enforce the fishing legislation at sea and therefore lower bycatch of non-commercial species. The PoM also reports regulation of commercial fisheries aiming to reduce and manage fishing effort, which may thereby reduce bycatch rates of non-commercial fish. 

General impacts on fish habitats and population, such as eutrophication or contamination, are addressed by general biodiversity measures for all species and habitats. Lithuania also explains that measures reported for D5 (under objective 3) have positive impacts on biodiversity and food webs.

The assessment concludes that pressures on fish are partially addressed by the PoM.

At regional level, Lithuania links its PoM to HELCOM.

Lithuania identified bycatch of marine mammals as the main pressure on this group. The PoM includes two measures addressing this issue, one directly (M020-T6PR6) and one indirectly (M021-T6PR7). However, the vague description of the measures makes it impossible to conclude the extent to which this impact is reduced.

Apart from the measures on bycatch, Lithuania reports one measure to reduce the mortality of mammals due to anthropogenic impacts (such as pollution) by means of rescuing injured animals.

The PoM includes legislation to prevent impacts on the marine environment via EIA or MSP, however, neither the specific pressures or activities covered nor the ways in which they are tackled, are detailed in the PoM. The measures reported for biodiversity, and specifically mammals, do not address marine litter and underwater noise. In general, while some pressures are addressed by the PoM, the level of detail provided in the description of the measures is very low, leaving room for doubt on which activities are covered and to what extent. Given this uncertainty, pressures on mammals are considered partially addressed.

General impacts on fish habitats and population, such as eutrophication or contamination, are only addressed by general biodiversity measures relevant for all species and habitats. Eutrophication is also covered by measures reported for D5 (objective 3) that have positive impacts on D4 according to Lithuania.
Mammals: pressures are partially addressed. The measures address incidental bycatch from fisheries. Other relevant impacts on mammals may be addressed by legislation, although the specifics are unclear. One measure indirectly addresses impacts on mammals to some extent as it aims to rescue injured animals. While some pressures are addressed, the level of details provided in the description of the measures is very low, leaving a large uncertainty on which activities are covered and to what extent.

LT ;BAL ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Lithuania reports that water column habitats suffer from very high levels of eutrophication due to nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from several rivers flowing into the Curonian Lagoon that later exit to the Baltic Sea. This pressure is locally addressed by legislation on best practices in the use of fertilisers for agriculture in this area, and also by measures directly tackling the removal of nutrients from the Lagoon, either directly by removing phytoplankton, or indirectly by enlarging the areas where denitrification processes take place. 

The PoM therefore considers the nutrient inputs from agriculture as a relevant pressure on water column habitats. Two measures address this pressure in a broader scope, beyond the Curonian Lagoon: the Nitrates and Sludge Directives. However, the PoM does not provide much detail on their implementation, leaving some uncertainty on the degree of coverage of these activities regarding water column habitats. Lithuania also explains that the measures reported for D5 (objective 3) have positive impacts on D4, and potentially water column habitats.

Measures on existing legislation address nutrient inputs and contaminants from other, unspecified, sources. Given the vague content of these measures and the lack of link to the measures on contaminants (D8), it is difficult to establish the activities or areas covered. The PoM does not link any of its measures to NIS introductions regarding water column habitats.

Therefore, the PoM partially addresses pressures on water column habitats, especially due to the lack detail provided on measures addressing pressures beyond the Curonian lagoon.

In its Article 8 reporting, Lithuania identified dredging and port operations as activities causing physical loss and damage, as well as fisheries as sources of physical damage. The measures specifically addressing seabed habitats do not tackle any of these activities. Furthermore, dredging a certain area was proposed as a measure to promote denitrification (see D5 section).

The PoM includes a series of pieces of existing legislation for seabed habitats such as EIA, SEA, national resolution on regulations of areas of importance for the conservation of habitats or birds, or addressing biodiversity generally and aiming to reduce and prevent impacts from various human activities. However, the legislation and the content provided by the PoM are not sufficient to draw conclusions on either the pressures or activities covered with respect to seabed habitats. Despite the inclusion of general regulation on MSP, fisheries, biodiversity and other fields, the content of the PoM and the vague descriptions of the measures do not enable an assessment of its impact on human activities and thus its consequences for the marine environment in the form of potential reduction of pressures.

Given the lack of detail, the assessment concludes that pressures on seabed habitats are not addressed.

In the Baltic Sea, half of the Member States report physical loss from marine-based renewable energy production, while half of them also report physical damage caused by fisheries. As explained above, the measures reported by Lithuania for seabed habitats do not fully cover these activities.

At regional level, Lithuania links its biodiversity measures to HELCOM.
";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: pressures are partially addressed. Eutrophication in the Curonian Lagoon is addressed by preventing nutrient inputs and also by a pilot project on removing the excess of phytoplankton in the water body. Lithuania also explains that the measures reported for D5 have positive impacts on D4 (and potentially water column habitats). Existing legislation addresses nutrients and contaminants through a general approach, however, it is not clear which areas and activities are covered, apart from agriculture in the Curonian Lagoon. The measures reported for biodiversity, and specifically water column habits, do not address NIS. 
Seabed habitats: pressures are not addressed. None of the pressures identified in Article 8 reporting are directly addressed (dredging and port operations for both physical loss and damage, and fisheries for physical damage).

LT ;BAL ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
For water column habitats, Lithuania defined (for GES) two thresholds linked to the relative biomass of zooplankton: one on general zooplankton microphages, and another specifically on the Copepoda group. 

A single general target was defined by Lithuania for biodiversity, focusing on ensuring the normal functioning of marine ecosystems, maintaining diversity, abundance and distribution of marine birds, fish and other marine organisms of lower trophic levels. In these latter elements, ‘marine organisms of lower trophic levels’ should comprise phytoplankton and zooplankton, the main components of water column habitats. 

The PoM includes measures to improve the chemical quality of the water column habitats, reducing eutrophication (a link has been made with the measures reported for D5) and pollution from several human sources. However, no clear link is made from the reported measures to their effect on zooplankton populations, and there is still a large degree of uncertainty regarding which activities are covered. The measures addressing general impacts on the marine environment are also vaguely described, which makes it difficult to assess whether GES and targets for water column habitats have been fully addressed. Therefore, GES and targets for water column habitats are partially addressed.

Lithuania defined as GES for seabed habitats the maintenance of two indicators: a threshold value of ‘extent of affected seafloor’ and also a benthic quality index (BQI), both compared to reference points from previous years. Given that no impacts on seabed habitats are directly identified and tackled by the PoM, the reported measures cannot be considered to work towards the achievement of either threshold. The BQI is referenced in one of the indirect measures (M014-T5PR3), although it will not directly reduce impacts on the seafloor but only improve the information available for future evaluations.

A single general target was defined by Lithuania for biodiversity. It focuses on ensuring the normal functioning of marine ecosystems, maintaining diversity, abundance and distribution of marine birds, fish and other marine organisms of lower trophic levels.

Latvia links its measures for biodiversity to HELCOM activities.

At a regional level, Latvia identified physical loss as a relevant pressure under Article 8, pointing to the dumping of dredge material as an underlying cause, which may be addressed through measures covering EIA. The neighbouring Member States mainly reported marine-based renewable energy as a source of physical loss, however, this activity is not relevant in Latvian waters as there are no renewable energy installations. Latvia did not identify physical damage as a relevant pressure under Article 8; however, most other Baltic Sea Member States have identified this pressure as relevant for their waters. Four out of the eight Baltic Sea Member States have identified fisheries as an activity causing this pressure. Therefore, it is likely that the pressure may also be relevant for Latvia. Latvia states that the regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers of 2 May 2007 No 296 “Regulations on Industrial Fishing in Territorial Waters and Economic Zone Waters” significantly reduces the physical impact of fisheries on benthic habitats, by restricting the use of fishing trawls in the coastal zone (up to 20 m depth).

MT ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"In its PoM, Malta reports that its water column habitats have good status overall, with plankton communities being consistent with an oligotrophic regime. It states that exceptions occur only in a few small areas, primarily harbour areas. The measures reported by Malta for water column habitats chiefly address eutrophication, with a number also covering discharge of sewage from transport and recreational ships in identified risk areas. Pressures such as NIS (D2) and contaminants (D8) are not addressed for this habitat type. It is possible that they are addressed by measures under other descriptors, but this cannot be assessed in this section. Therefore, pressures are partially covered for water column habitats. 

In its Article 8 reporting, Malta identified physical loss and damage as relevant pressures for seabed integrity. It reported that port operations, together with the placement and operation of offshore structures, cause physical loss, and that fisheries, dredging, industry, urban, and tourism and recreation activities were causing physical damage. 

Physical loss and damage from offshore operations and constructions will be covered by measures linked to EIA and offshore licensing regimes. Solid-waste disposal and marine hydrocarbon extraction activities are also covered by the PoM. Spatial protection measures will address various activities in these protected sites. Physical loss from port operations is primarily addressed by measures covering mooring and anchoring management. Fisheries impacts causing physical damage are addressed by fisheries management measures, while dredging is likely to be covered by EIA processes. Tourism and recreational activities are covered by mooring of recreational boats. A code of conduct for divers and spear fishermen will indirectly reduce pressures resulting from this activity. Physical damage resulting from aquaculture is also covered by the PoM. However, impacts from industry and urban activities, identified as relevant under Article 8, are not addressed by seabed-specific measures. They are likely to be covered by measures defined under other descriptors, however, the link about how these measures would affect seabed habitats is no clearly made. Therefore, the PoM only partially addresses pressures. 

At the subregional level, physical loss and damage were also identified as relevant by Italy and Greece, with land claim and coastal defence, and submarine cable and pipeline laying cited as responsible for physical loss, while fisheries were a cause of physical damage. Although fisheries activities are covered by Malta, submarine cables, land claim and coastal defence are not. This may be because such activities are not important in Malta's waters. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives concerns seafloor integrity: ‘Sea‐floor integrity is maintained, especially in priority benthic habitats’  (with associated operational objectives and indicators). The Plan Bleu Regional Activity Centre (one of the six UNEP/MAP’s Regional Advisory Committees, RACs) explains that, despite efforts, the Mediterranean Sea still faces several pressures, among which are the fishing methods destroying or disturbing the seafloor . At the very least, fisheries play a role in physical losses and damage to the Western Mediterranean Sea. Malta covers through its PoM fishing impacts on seabed habitats in MPAs and some extent of deep sea fishing. Therefore, impacts from fisheries are covered only in certain areas. ";"Water column habitats: Pressures for water column habitats are partially addressed. The measures aim to reduce eutrophication, particularly discharges of sewage from transport and recreational ships. However, impacts from NIS and contaminants are not covered by the biodiversity measures.

Seabed habitats: The measures partially address the relevant pressures. Physical loss and damage from offshore operations, solid waste disposal, marine hydrocarbon extraction, port operations, fisheries, dredging, tourism and aquaculture are covered by the PoM.

They are likely to be covered by measures defined under other descriptors, however, the link about how these measures would affect seabed habitats is no clearly made.

MT ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Malta did not define GES for water column habitats. 

Due to data gaps, only an interim target has been defined. This target aims to strengthen knowledge via updated data on key characteristics of the water column (including plankton communities), thereby enabling Malta to further develop the definition of GES for these habitat types in line with the requirements of the MSFD. Monitoring efforts under the MSFD monitoring programme will also address this target. The target is hence considered as covered. 

Malta acknowledges that GES and targets for seabed habitats are not always measurable, making assessments of progress towards achieving them difficult. Nevertheless, it reports that knowledge gaps on benthic habitats and links with pressures made it impossible to establish quantitative targets.

Malta’s GES definition for seabed habitats aims for a stable natural range and extent of marine habitats and species, in line with physiographic and climatic conditions, taking into consideration the sustainable use of the marine environment. It states that the structure and function of marine habitats should ensure their long-term viability and that this long-term viability should not be compromised by anthropogenic pressures and impacts. Malta addresses a wide range of activities impacting seabed habitats in its waters, and implements spatial protection measures. This will, to a certain extent, contribute to the achievement of GES. However, not all seabed habitats are protected (e.g. MPAs currently only protect seagrass beds) and some activities (urban, industry), are omitted or only partly and indirectly addressed (tourism, recreation, anchoring of ships and boats). Fisheries are mainly addressed in MPAs. GES is thus only partially addressed by the PoM.

Malta reports six environmental targets, which it categorises as interim targets: 
•	Efforts to be made, through implementation of conservation measures or existing permitting and licensing procedures, to ensure maintenance of the distributional range and extent of selected habitat types in selected areas (for biocoenosis of mediolittoral sands, Posidonia meadows and maerl facies). 
•	Stable species composition and abundance (littoral rock and biogenic reefs, shallow sublittoral sediment, shelf sublittoral sediment).
•	Maintain the health status of seagrass meadows (Posidonia oceanica).
•	Signs of recovery for benthic habitats affected by currently regulated anthropogenic activities (littoral rock and biogenic reefs, shallow sublittoral sediment).
•	Maintenance and enforcement regulations governing fishing activities within the 25 nautical mile Fisheries Management Zone (littoral rock and biogenic reefs, shallow sublittoral sediment, Posidonia meadows).
•	Localised or sensitive marine habitats are afforded legal protection by 2025 (upper bathyal rock).

Similar to GES, Malta addresses several activities and aims to reduce their physical impact on different seabed habitats. These measures will partly contribute towards the achievement of the interim targets. Specific MPA measures for seagrass beds will address the targets linked to this habitat type. Nevertheless, the PoM relies on a number of research efforts and pilot projects to improve future management of marine activities, which will only indirectly support the achievement of the targets. Malta refers to significant knowledge gaps, which it considers an obstacle to achieving GES and targets in the near future. The targets are therefore only partially covered.
";"Water column habitats: GES was not defined for water column habitats and therefore no conclusion can be drawn in the regards of GES. However, Malta defined an interim target which aims to close data gaps through monitoring efforts under the MSFD and this will be covered.

Fisheries impacts causing physical damage are addressed by fisheries management measures, while dredging is likely to be covered by EIA processes. Tourism and recreational activities are covered by mooring of recreational boats. A code of conduct for divers and spear fishermen will indirectly reduce pressures resulting from this activity. Physical damage resulting from aquaculture is also covered by the PoM. However, impacts from industry and urban activities, identified as relevant under Article 8, are not addressed by seabed-specific measures. They are likely to be covered by measures defined under other descriptors, however, the link about how these measures would affect seabed habitats is no clearly made. Therefore, the PoM only partially addresses pressures. 

At the subregional level, physical loss and damage were also identified as relevant by Italy and Greece, with land claim and coastal defence, and submarine cable and pipeline laying cited as responsible for physical loss, while fisheries were a cause of physical damage. Although fisheries activities are covered by Malta, submarine cables, land claim and coastal defence are not. This may be because such activities are not important in Malta's waters. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives concerns seafloor integrity: ‘Sea‐floor integrity is maintained, especially in priority benthic habitats’  (with associated operational objectives and indicators). The Plan Bleu Regional Activity Centre (one of the six UNEP/MAP’s Regional Advisory Committees, RACs) explains that, despite efforts, the Mediterranean Sea still faces several pressures, among which are the fishing methods destroying or disturbing the seafloor . At the very least, fisheries play a role in physical losses and damage to the Western Mediterranean Sea. Malta covers through its PoM fishing impacts on seabed habitats in MPAs and some extent of deep sea fishing. Therefore, impacts from fisheries are covered only in certain areas. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
o	Water column habitats: Pressures for water column habitats are partially addressed. The measures aim to reduce eutrophication, particularly discharges of sewage from transport and recreational ships. However, impacts from NIS and contaminants are not covered by the biodiversity measures. It is possible that they are addressed by measures under other descriptors, but this cannot be assessed in this section.
o	 Seabed habitats: The measures partially address the relevant pressures. Physical loss and damage from offshore operations, solid waste disposal, marine hydrocarbon extraction, port operations, fisheries, dredging, tourism and aquaculture are covered by the PoM. However, other activities reported under Article 8, such as industry and urban activities, are not addressed by seabed-specific measures. They are likely to be covered by measures defined under other descriptors, however, the link about how these measures would affect seabed habitats is no clearly made. Furthermore, fishing impacts are primarily addressed in MPAs and deep sea but not in Malta’s entire waters. Therefore, impacts from fisheries are covered only in certain areas.";2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/21df4b49-2dc8-4836-aa4a-540ddd6b6d35/details
MT ;MED ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Malta did not define GES for water column habitats. 

Due to data gaps, only an interim target has been defined. This target aims to strengthen knowledge via updated data on key characteristics of the water column (including plankton communities), thereby enabling Malta to further develop the definition of GES for these habitat types in line with the requirements of the MSFD. Monitoring efforts under the MSFD monitoring programme will also address this target. The target is hence considered as covered. 

Malta acknowledges that GES and targets for seabed habitats are not always measurable, making assessments of progress towards achieving them difficult. Nevertheless, it reports that knowledge gaps on benthic habitats and links with pressures made it impossible to establish quantitative targets.

Malta’s GES definition for seabed habitats aims for a stable natural range and extent of marine habitats and species, in line with physiographic and climatic conditions, taking into consideration the sustainable use of the marine environment. It states that the structure and function of marine habitats should ensure their long-term viability and that this long-term viability should not be compromised by anthropogenic pressures and impacts. Malta addresses a wide range of activities impacting seabed habitats in its waters, and implements spatial protection measures. This will, to a certain extent, contribute to the achievement of GES. However, not all seabed habitats are protected (e.g. MPAs currently only protect seagrass beds) and some activities (urban, industry), are omitted or only partly and indirectly addressed (tourism, recreation, anchoring of ships and boats). Fisheries are mainly addressed in MPAs. GES is thus only partially addressed by the PoM.

Malta reports six environmental targets, which it categorises as interim targets: 
•	Efforts to be made, through implementation of conservation measures or existing permitting and licensing procedures, to ensure maintenance of the distributional range and extent of selected habitat types in selected areas (for biocoenosis of mediolittoral sands, Posidonia meadows and maerl facies). 
•	Stable species composition and abundance (littoral rock and biogenic reefs, shallow sublittoral sediment, shelf sublittoral sediment).
•	Maintain the health status of seagrass meadows (Posidonia oceanica).
•	Signs of recovery for benthic habitats affected by currently regulated anthropogenic activities (littoral rock and biogenic reefs, shallow sublittoral sediment).
•	Maintenance and enforcement regulations governing fishing activities within the 25 nautical mile Fisheries Management Zone (littoral rock and biogenic reefs, shallow sublittoral sediment, Posidonia meadows).
•	Localised or sensitive marine habitats are afforded legal protection by 2025 (upper bathyal rock).

Similar to GES, Malta addresses several activities and aims to reduce their physical impact on different seabed habitats. These measures will partly contribute towards the achievement of the interim targets. Specific MPA measures for seagrass beds will address the targets linked to this habitat type. Nevertheless, the PoM relies on a number of research efforts and pilot projects to improve future management of marine activities, which will only indirectly support the achievement of the targets. Malta refers to significant knowledge gaps, which it considers an obstacle to achieving GES and targets in the near future. The targets are therefore only partially covered.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: GES was not defined for water column habitats and therefore no conclusion can be drawn in the regards of GES. However, Malta defined an interim target which aims to close data gaps through monitoring efforts under the MSFD and this will be covered.
Seabed habitats: GES and targets are partially addressed. Malta addresses a wide range of activities which impact seabed habitats. It also implements spatial protection measures, which will to some extent contribute towards the achievement of GES. However, not all seabed habitats, as defined in the targets, are protected (e.g. MPAs currently only protect seagrass beds).";;;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/21df4b49-2dc8-4836-aa4a-540ddd6b6d35/details

NL ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"The measure linked to environmental assessments of the impacts of large-scale interventions and activities in the marine environment, including compensation (M001), the measures aiming to expanding the scope of the Nature Conservation Act and the Flora and Fauna Act (M002), and regulating other activities within the coastal zone (M005) will reduce pressures of human activities on water column habitats (M001). Furthermore, the measures covering restriction if fisheries in the coastal zone and a reduction of seabed-destructing fishing activities (M003, M040) will also contribute to reducing these pressures on water column habitats. The Member State does not make links to WFD measures under biodiversity, but it is likely that these measures reported under D5 will contribute positively to water column habitat conditions. This is further described in Section 4.9.6 ‘Assessment of the impact of measures reported under pressure descriptors on D1, 4, 6 biodiversity’. Therefore, the measures partly address measures on water column habitats. 

The Netherlands reports measures to address the pressure ‘physical damage for seabed habitats’, caused by activities such as land claim, sand extraction, sand replenishment M001, M004), dredging (M001), fisheries (M003, M061) and maintenance of cables and pipelines (M004). It also addresses the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by fisheries activities for seabed habitats (M003, M040, M061). Impacts on seabed habitats caused by various activities are addressed by the PoM. These activities include land claim, sand extraction, sand replenishment (M001, M004), dredging (M001), fisheries (M003, M040, M061), maintenance of cables and pipelines (M004, M005), recreation, fishing, shipping, civil aviation, shell extraction (M005) and non-reported activities (M002, M039). Biological disturbance caused by land claim, sand extraction, sand replenishment, dredging (M001), recreation, fishing, shipping, civil aviation, shell extraction, maintenance of cables and pipelines (M005) and non-reported activities (M002) are also included. 

Within its PoM, the Netherlands states ""Other designated uses such as oil and gas extraction and cables and pipelines are considered activities that do not disturb the seabed to any significant extent. These activities can continue under the current conditions"" .

At a subregional level, the Netherlands identified the pressure ‘physical loss, caused by marine mining (sand, gravel, rock) and land claim and coastal defences’ in its Article 8 reporting. These activities are covered by the PoM. In the same Article 8 reporting, it also identified the pressure ‘physical damage’ as relevant for its marine waters, pointing to fishing and marine mining (sand, gravel rock) as activities causing this pressure. These two activities are also covered by the PoM reported here. The Netherlands did not identify marine-based renewable energy generation as an activity relevant for seabed habitats.

As the fish measures link to these criteria, the PoM addresses the GES as defined, but the extent of this contribution and whether it will achieve GES for fish cannot be determined. 

Target 1b links to the improvement of the size, quality and distribution of populations of vulnerable fish species, including skate, rays and sharks, which the Netherlands addresses through the measures M001 to M003, M039, M040 and M041. Target 1h links to the demographic characteristics of fish and resilient populations, addressed by measures M003 M005 and M039.

The measure linked to environmental assessments of the impacts of large-scale interventions and activities in the marine environment, including compensation (M001), the measures aiming to expanding the scope of the Nature Conservation Act and the Flora and Fauna Act (M002), and regulating other activities within the coastal zone (M005) will reduce pressures of human activities on water column habitats (M001). Furthermore, the measures covering restriction if fisheries in the coastal zone and a reduction of seabed-destructing fishing activities (M003, M040) will also contribute to reducing these pressures on water column habitats. The Member State does not make links to WFD measures under biodiversity, but it is likely that these measures reported under D5 will contribute positively to water column habitat conditions. This is further described in Section 4.9.6 ‘Assessment of the impact of measures reported under pressure descriptors on D1, 4, 6 biodiversity’. Therefore, the measures partly address measures on water column habitats. 

The Netherlands reports measures to address the pressure ‘physical damage for seabed habitats’, caused by activities such as land claim, sand extraction, sand replenishment M001, M004), dredging (M001), fisheries (M003, M061) and maintenance of cables and pipelines (M004). It also addresses the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by fisheries activities for seabed habitats (M003, M040, M061). Impacts on seabed habitats caused by various activities are addressed by the PoM. These activities include land claim, sand extraction, sand replenishment (M001, M004), dredging (M001), fisheries (M003, M040, M061), maintenance of cables and pipelines (M004, M005), recreation, fishing, shipping, civil aviation, shell extraction (M005) and non-reported activities (M002, M039). Biological disturbance caused by land claim, sand extraction, sand replenishment, dredging (M001), recreation, fishing, shipping, civil aviation, shell extraction, maintenance of cables and pipelines (M005) and non-reported activities (M002) are also included. 

Within its PoM, the Netherlands states ""Other designated uses such as oil and gas extraction and cables and pipelines are considered activities that do not disturb the seabed to any significant extent. These activities can continue under the current conditions"" .

At a subregional level, the Netherlands identified the pressure ‘physical loss, caused by marine mining (sand, gravel, rock) and land claim and coastal defences’ in its Article 8 reporting. These activities are covered by the PoM. In the same Article 8 reporting, it also identified the pressure ‘physical damage’ as relevant for its marine waters, pointing to fishing and marine mining (sand, gravel rock) as activities causing this pressure.

PL ;ATL ;14;D1-F;Exceptions;"Fish
Poland applies Article 14(1)(e) (‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’). Poland states that although a recent assessment (on which it provides no further information) suggested that the LFI (large fish indicator) in both the western and eastern part of Polish waters reaches the levels as defined by GES, it is not certain whether it will be maintained after 2020. This is justified by an explanation of how the LFI is affected not only by fishing but also other environmental factors, such as climate change and salinity. Given that the LFI in the Baltic Sea is strongly dependent on the size of cod - which is strongly correlated with temperature and salinity - climatic conditions could affect whether or not LFI will remain at GES. 

Poland has further clarified its reasoning for the application of this exception. The Member State comments that successful spawning for cod in the Baltic sea, depends on water inflows from the North Sea. Currently, it is observed that cod is smaller and thinner than before. That could, according to scientists, be caused by larger anoxic zones in the Baltic sea (caused by eutrophication but also probably by climate change which cause less numerous inflows of saline water containing high levels of oxygen from the North Sea). Anoxic zones at the sea bottom may cause that some food resources at the bottom of the sea are not available for cod. Also, climate change may affect pelagic fish migrations. They can migrate further north in the Baltic Sea and may not be available for cod as a food resource (in addition to the low levels of salinity for cod to follow them upwards). Other natural conditions may also affect cod condition like increased population of seals and as a result cod may be affected by seal parasites. Regarding the link to the LFI index: cod is the largest species included into the Large Fish Index (other big fish species like salmon are of minor importance as they are not so numerous in Polish marine waters). The Member State adds that there are uncertainties about the state of cod populations in its marine waters as the current knowledge is based on incomplete data for eastern cod stocks. Finally, Poland has clarified that this exception has been applied to fish biodiversity (D1, 4), because the LFI index is one of the indices referenced in its fish biodiversity targets as defined in Article 10. 

This assessment finds the provided justification is partially grounded. It is indeed true that temperature, salinity, climatic conditions can affect the LFI (linked here in particular to cod by Poland), however, this justification is not fully grounded.

PL ;ATL ;14;D1-M;Exceptions;"Poland reports an exception for by-catch levels of harbour porpoises, as defined by Article 14(1)(a) (‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’). Poland reports that it is aware that its current measures were insufficient to address harbour porpoise by-catch from fisheries, and thus has established new measures. It however states that GES is unlikely to be achieved by 2020, because of the large distributional range of this species, causing by-catch to occur in neighbouring Member States’ waters over which it has no control. This, it says, reduces the effectiveness of its national measures. 

Poland has further clarified that the scale of the by-catch problem is not well known in Polish waters because its monitoring programme that relates to by-catch of these species is not yet fully implemented. As such, it cannot know how much of the problem of by-catch affecting the Baltic sea harbour porpoise population is caused by Poland. Furthermore, according to Poland, by-catch of harbour porpoises is much higher in other Baltic Sea countries, because the specie’s population size is larger in other countries as compared to Poland.

This assessment finds this argument insufficient to justify the exception and thus not grounded, as the issue of by-catch from other border regions can be adequately controlled through cross-border partnership processes.

PL ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Even though no measures have been reported for water column habitats, a number of measures reported for food webs (D4) will impact pressures and activities that are relevant for water column habitats.

For example, the national, regional and international legislation and agreements referred to by Poland will contribute to improved environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea. These include the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, the Habitats Directive (Natura 2000) , the Nature Conservation Act and EIA procedures. Furthermore, Poland addresses urban waste water through its existing measures. Nevertheless, the reported measures will only partially address pressures on water column habitats.

As it reported no measures specific to water column habitats, Poland makes no clear link to HELCOM.  

While its Article 8 report did not highlight any activities as relevant for causing pressures for D1, 6 seabed habitats, Poland’s PoM nonetheless includes measures that address relevant pressures and associated activities.

Poland links the existing measures of its seabed habitats PoM to national, regional and international legislation and agreements that will contribute to improved environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea, including the condition of seabed habitats. These include the action plan for the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, the regional Development Strategy until 2020 and the Nature Conservation Act. As reported for the other species groups, the new measures linking to MSP and management of marine activities are also reported for seabed habitats and these will also contribute to a general reduction of pressures (KTM38_2, KTM38_3).

The pressure ‘contamination’ caused by the dumping of sediment is associated with two measures (KTM14_5, KTM31_3). Existing measures linked to river basin management and urban waste water management will contribute to the reduction of this pressure. 

Physical damage of seabed habitats caused by fishing will be addressed through existing measures under the CFP, together with one newly-developed measure limiting bottom trawling in certain areas (KTM27). Physical damage caused by dumping of sediment deposits will also be addressed by one new measure (KTM14_5). 

At the subregional level, four of Poland’s neighbouring Member States report marine renewable energy as a relevant activity for causing the pressure ‘physical loss’ in their waters. Currently, an offshore wind farm facility in Polish waters is planned by 2030. Even though Poland’s PoM does not specifically address pressures resulting from wind farms, this may be addressed through new measures to manage marine activities by integrating MSP and EIA into their management plans. As this is not detailed in the report, it cannot be assessed.

Furthermore, a number of Poland’s neighbours also report physical damage as a relevant pressure in their marine waters and identify fisheries as a pressure-causing activity. These impacts are directly addressed by Polish new measures, that aim to reduce the impact of bottom-trawl fishing on seabed habitats.

At the regional level, according to the HELCOM matrix on human activities and pressures, physical loss in the marine environment can be caused by aquaculture, marine-based renewable energy generation, electricity cables, benthic trawling and mussel/scallop dredging, diverse types of harvesting (maerl, reed), extraction of oil and gas, all types of physical restructuring of coastline or seabed (such as land claim, dredging, offshore structures, coastal defence, etc.), tourism infrastructure, transport infrastructure, solid waste disposal, carbon capture and storage, and military operations. Physical damage can be caused by aquaculture, marine-based renewable energy generation, electricity cables, fish and shellfish harvesting, marine plant harvesting, extraction of minerals, oil and gas, coastal defence, coastal dams, restructuring seabed morphology, tourism infrastructure and activities, transport infrastructure, shipping, solid waste disposal, military operations and research . While the latter represents a list of the possible sources of physical damage, these have not been prioritised. Poland links its seabed habitat measures to HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan. 
";"Water column habitats: Even though no water column-specific measures are reported, spatial protection measures, measures linked to environmental conservation and measures on contaminants in water partially address water column habitats.
Seabed habitats: Even though Poland had not reported pressures for seabed habitats under Article 8, it reports measures to address physical damage caused by bottom-trawl fishing, pollution from dumping of sediment and waste water. The measures therefore address seabed habitat pressures.";3;Addressed (seabed habitats), partially addressed (water column habitats);https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/3b819bdd-6dec-46b8-b2c4-e3bf7f254bf3/details
PL ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Poland’s GES refers to the water column species through an indictor covering the mean size and total abundance of zooplankton. One indicator links to transparency of water, nitrogen and inorganic phosphates and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Even though some of Poland’s food web (D4) measures will contribute to improving water column habitats, they will only partially address GES. 

The targets include indicators linked to the number and average size of the zooplankton, a structure of zooplankton with a large proportion of individuals with large body size (mainly copepods) which effectively consume the phytoplankton and provide good quality food for zooplanktonic fish, and an amount of zooplankton that will support fish growth. As stated for the GES assessment, the reported food web (D4) measures will only partially contribute to the achievement of these targets. 

Poland’s GES for seabed habitats defines indicators linked to the ratio of biomass of perennial species to the total biomass of macrophytes (SM1) and a multimetric indicator of macrozoobenthos (B). The measures aim to reduce the impacts of fishing and dumping of sediment on seabed habitats. Furthermore, the measures aim to gather a better understanding of the seabed and protect vulnerable habitats through the SAC system. Overall, the measures seem to cover GES. 

In addition to its general biodiversity targets, Poland also links its targets to seabed habitat indicators, which cover macrophytes and aim to achieve a ratio of biomass of perennial species to the total biomass of macrophytes greater than or equal to the threshold defined under GES. As for the GES, the assessment finds that the necessary pressures are addressed and seabed habitats protected through SACs. ";"Water column habitats: The measures partially address water column habitats, because even though certain measures address general aspects of water column habitats, no specific measures have been reported for planktonic communities, even though these are referred to explicitly in the GES and targets defined by Poland.

PL ;ATL ;14;D1 Pelagic ;Exceptions;"Seabed habitats
Poland refers to three justifications for exceptions for seabed habitats.
•	Firstly, it reports that benthic ecosystems and organisms are characterised by slow growth. Expected changes leading to improved ecosystems of the seabed can be a slow and long-term process and, consequently, targets linked to a recovery of organisms and expansion of habitat distribution, will not be achieved by 2020. 

This assessment finds that this justification grounded. 

•	Secondly, Poland reports that it has introduced a biotic index for seabed habitats (B) to complement the criteria of the WFD, as this index will reflect the abundance and species richness in the structure of benthic communities, in addition to their sensitivity to eutrophication depending on their location. Poland states two invasive non-indigenous species have significant impact on the indicator index B, one polychaete species (Marenzelleria sp.) and one bivalve species (Mya arenaria). These species spread easily and occur in abundance in some areas, which will inhibit the achievement of GES even after the implementation of new measures. 

Measures to control NIS species have been reported by Poland under D2, furthermore seabed mapping is identified as a measure, which implies that further work is required to understand the distribution and quality of seabed habitats. This assessment finds that an increase in Mya arenaria density have been observed overall in the Baltic, which have been associated with increases in organic material. Furthermore, interspecific interactions occur in the Baltic, causing Macoma balthica to decrease in biomass in places where M. arenaria is abundant. Marenzelleria spp. are known to have invaded soft sediments across the Baltic and are considered to be causing significant impacts on ecosystem functioning. One issue is that Poland applies this exception to all seabed habitats without attempting to say which specific habitats are affected by these two species. The exception needs to be more specific. Therefore, this assessment finds the provided justification partially grounded.  

•	Thirdly, in certain areas of the Baltic Sea, a regular decrease in oxygen occurs, which is regulated by occasional influx of water with high salinity and oxygen from areas of the Kattegat. Poland states that these conditions are natural and that the implementation of its conservation activities will not change or improve benthic habitats in these areas. 

If the oxygen levels are indeed natural, then there is nothing for the benthic habitats to recover from. However, the vast majority of oxygen depletion in the Baltic is considered to be due to nutrient enrichment (D5) with scientific papers showing the changes in extent of oxygen depletion over the past 100 years. Hence this justification is not found to be grounded.   

Even though Poland does not report an exception article in respect of seabed habitats, the explanations strongly indicate a link to exceptions under Article 14(1) (e) for the first and third justifications and 14(1)(a) for the second justification relating to NIS, as the Member State is not responsible for the spreading of NIS. This has not been clarified by the Member State. Overall, this assessment finds the exception partially grounded.  ";Seabed habitats: Poland reports three reasons for its failure to achieve GES and targets for seabed habitats, mostly linked to natural conditions. The first relates to the slow recovery rates of benthic organisms and habitats which this assessment finds grounded, the second refers to two NIS which have spread significantly in Polish waters which is assessment finds partially grounded, and the third one refers to areas with naturally occurring seasonal low oxygen levels which this assessment finds not grounded. As such, overall, this assessment finds the justifications for the application of this exception partially grounded. ;2;Justification partially grounded;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/3b819bdd-6dec-46b8-b2c4-e3bf7f254bf3/details

Poland will protect against pressures on fish habitats and populations through general environmental conservation measures under the Habitats Directive. It also aims to reintroduce and protect endangered species, such as the Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser sturio). 

Poland addresses fisheries impacts through measures under the CFP and the new measure KTM27, which will introduce limits to bottom-trawl fishing in Polish waters. 

By-catch of non-target species will be covered by the new measure KTM20_4.

At a regional level, Poland links its group of measures reported for fish to HELCOM’s Baltic Sea Protected Areas (BSPAs), in addition to the HELCOM project on monitoring coastal fish stocks of the Baltic Sea to support management based on ecosystem function (HELCOM FISH-PRO II).

PL ;ATL ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
As stated above for birds, Poland’s GES definition is largely quite general. However, it defined the ‘Large Fish Index’ of open water and coastal species as a GES indicator, in addition to the numbers of key species in coastal waters, the numbers of key trophic groups in coastal waters (fish prey), and stocks of flounder. The assessment finds that Poland’s PoM for fish biodiversity mainly focuses on commercial fish species, with little reference to species identified within the Habitats Directive or the wider biodiversity of fish species in Polish waters. However, Poland states that GES is already being met. Therefore, the measures address GES.

Poland links its targets to general biodiversity components, such as distribution, abundance, population health and status, and habitat structure and ecosystem function. However, it defined an indicator linked to fish, which links to the volume index of coastal fish, the LFI and thresholds defined by ICES. As stated above for GES, the Member State considers GES as achieved, therefore targets are likely to be addressed as well. Hence, the PoM addresses the targets defined for fish. 

Poland defines a number of indicators for GES linked to mammals, such as the growth rate of mammal populations, layers of fatty tissue of marine mammals and percentage of pregnant marine mammals. Despite this, its measures focus mainly on the harbour porpoise. Seals are only covered through one measure, which aims to reduce by-catch levels of seals.

PL ;ATL ;14;D4;Exceptions;"Fish
Poland applies Article 14(1)(e) (‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’). Poland states that although a recent assessment (on which it provides no further information) suggested that the LFI (large fish indicator) in both the western and eastern part of Polish waters reaches the levels as defined by GES, it is not certain whether it will be maintained after 2020. This is justified by an explanation of how the LFI is affected not only by fishing but also other environmental factors, such as climate change and salinity. Given that the LFI in the Baltic Sea is strongly dependent on the size of cod - which is strongly correlated with temperature and salinity - climatic conditions could affect whether or not LFI will remain at GES. 

Poland has further clarified its reasoning for the application of this exception. The Member State comments that successful spawning for cod in the Baltic sea, depends on water inflows from the North Sea. Currently, it is observed that cod is smaller and thinner than before. That could, according to scientists, be caused by larger anoxic zones in the Baltic sea (caused by eutrophication but also probably by climate change which cause less numerous inflows of saline water containing high levels of oxygen from the North Sea). Anoxic zones at the sea bottom may cause that some food resources at the bottom of the sea are not available for cod. Also, climate change may affect pelagic fish migrations. They can migrate further north in the Baltic Sea and may not be available for cod as a food resource (in addition to the low levels of salinity for cod to follow them upwards). Other natural conditions may also affect cod condition like increased population of seals and as a result cod may be affected by seal parasites. Regarding the link to the LFI index: cod is the largest species included into the Large Fish Index (other big fish species like salmon are of minor importance as they are not so numerous in Polish marine waters). The Member State adds that there are uncertainties about the state of cod populations in its marine waters as the current knowledge is based on incomplete data for eastern cod stocks. Finally, Poland has clarified that this exception has been applied to fish biodiversity (D1, 4), because the LFI index is one of the indices referenced in its fish biodiversity targets as defined in Article 10. 

This assessment finds the provided justification is partially grounded. It is indeed true that temperature, salinity, climatic conditions can affect the LFI (linked here in particular to cod by Poland), however, this justification is not fully grounded. For the application of the exception the Member State should provide more detail, such as evidence for changing trends in indicators linked to predictable changes in temperature and salinity.

Mammals
Poland reports an exception for by-catch levels of harbour porpoises, as defined by Article 14(1)(a) (‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’). Poland reports that it is aware that its current measures were insufficient to address harbour porpoise by-catch from fisheries, and thus has established new measures. It however states that GES is unlikely to be achieved by 2020, because of the large distributional range of this species, causing by-catch to occur in neighbouring Member States’ waters over which it has no control. This, it says, reduces the effectiveness of its national measures. 

Poland has further clarified that the scale of the by-catch problem is not well known in Polish waters because its monitoring programme that relates to by-catch of these species is not yet fully implemented. As such, it cannot know how much of the problem of by-catch affecting the Baltic sea harbour porpoise population is caused by Poland. Furthermore, according to Poland, by-catch of harbour porpoises is much higher in other Baltic Sea countries, because the specie’s population size is larger in other countries as compared to Poland.

This assessment finds this argument insufficient to justify the exception and thus not grounded, as the issue of by-catch from other border regions can be adequately controlled through cross-border partnership processes. The Member State does not provide substantiated information on by-catch levels in neighbouring Member States nor does it indicate what type of regional collaboration activities have been applied within the region to address this issue. ";"Fish: Article 14(1)(e): Poland states that the LFI is dependent on the size of cod, which is strongly correlated to climatic conditions of temperature and salinity. The Member State should provide more detail, such as evidence for changing trends in indicators linked to predictable changes in temperature and salinity. This assessment finds the provided justification partially grounded. It is indeed true that temperature, salinity, climatic conditions can affect the LFI (linked here in particular to cod by Poland), however, this justification is not fully grounded. For the application of the exception the Member State should provide more detail, such as evidence for changing trends in indicators linked to predictable changes in temperature and salinity. Therefore, the justification is partially grounded.

Mammals: Article 14(1)(a):  Poland states that it cannot reduce by-catch levels of harbour porpoises effectively because such by-catch mainly occurs outside of its territory. The justification of the exception is not grounded. The Member State does not provide information on by-catch levels in neighbouring Member States nor does it indicate what type of regional collaboration activities have been applied within the region to address this issue.

PL ;ATL ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Poland’s GES refers to the water column species through an indictor covering the mean size and total abundance of zooplankton. One indicator links to transparency of water, nitrogen and inorganic phosphates and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Even though some of Poland’s food web (D4) measures will contribute to improving water column habitats, they will only partially address GES. 

The targets include indicators linked to the number and average size of the zooplankton, a structure of zooplankton with a large proportion of individuals with large body size (mainly copepods) which effectively consume the phytoplankton and provide good quality food for zooplanktonic fish, and an amount of zooplankton that will support fish growth. As stated for the GES assessment, the reported food web (D4) measures will only partially contribute to the achievement of these targets. 

Poland’s GES for seabed habitats defines indicators linked to the ratio of biomass of perennial species to the total biomass of macrophytes (SM1) and a multimetric indicator of macrozoobenthos (B). The measures aim to reduce the impacts of fishing and dumping of sediment on seabed habitats. Furthermore, the measures aim to gather a better understanding of the seabed and protect vulnerable habitats through the SAC system. Overall, the measures seem to cover GES. 

In addition to its general biodiversity targets, Poland also links its targets to seabed habitat indicators, which cover macrophytes and aim to achieve a ratio of biomass of perennial species to the total biomass of macrophytes greater than or equal to the threshold defined under GES. As for the GES, the assessment finds that the necessary pressures are addressed and seabed habitats protected through SACs. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: The measures partially address water column habitats, because even though certain measures address general aspects of water column habitats, no specific measures have been reported for planktonic communities, even though these are referred to explicitly in the GES and targets defined by Poland.

GES for birds is expected to be achieved by 2020. Poland applies exceptions for fish, mammals and seabed habitats, and does not expect to reach GES for these by 2020. No GES timeline is reported for water column habitats. 

Timeline for implementation of the PoM
Poland reports that three measures will be implemented by 2016 (KTM37_3, KTM14_5, KTM31_3). However, no clear date is given for the implementation of other measures and different timelines are reported, such as: annual implementation (KTM20_2), implemented when financing is secured (37_4 A), or implemented and then applied for an indefinite period (KTM38_1, KTM20_4, KTM38_2, KTM38_3, KTM27). For the latter, no clear implementation timeline has been reported. ";GES is expected to be achieved by 2020 for birds, and after 2020 for fish, mammals and seabed habitats, with justification for the applied exception assessed as partially grounded for fish and seabed habitats and not grounded for mammals. No timeline is reported for water column habitats. Poland also does not provide a clear timeline for the implementation of its measures or for all species groups and habitats. Therefore, the timelines are partially appropriate for fish and seabed habitats, not appropriate for mammals and no conclusion can be provided for the timelines related to birds and water column habitats.;2;Partially appropriate (seabed habitats).

PL ;ATL ;14;D6;Exceptions;"Seabed habitats
Poland refers to three justifications for exceptions for seabed habitats.
•	Firstly, it reports that benthic ecosystems and organisms are characterised by slow growth. Expected changes leading to improved ecosystems of the seabed can be a slow and long-term process and, consequently, targets linked to a recovery of organisms and expansion of habitat distribution, will not be achieved by 2020. 

This assessment finds that this justification grounded. 

•	Secondly, Poland reports that it has introduced a biotic index for seabed habitats (B) to complement the criteria of the WFD, as this index will reflect the abundance and species richness in the structure of benthic communities, in addition to their sensitivity to eutrophication depending on their location. Poland states two invasive non-indigenous species have significant impact on the indicator index B, one polychaete species (Marenzelleria sp.) and one bivalve species (Mya arenaria). These species spread easily and occur in abundance in some areas, which will inhibit the achievement of GES even after the implementation of new measures. 

Measures to control NIS species have been reported by Poland under D2, furthermore seabed mapping is identified as a measure, which implies that further work is required to understand the distribution and quality of seabed habitats. This assessment finds that an increase in Mya arenaria density have been observed overall in the Baltic, which have been associated with increases in organic material. Furthermore, interspecific interactions occur in the Baltic, causing Macoma balthica to decrease in biomass in places where M. arenaria is abundant. Marenzelleria spp. are known to have invaded soft sediments across the Baltic and are considered to be causing significant impacts on ecosystem functioning. One issue is that Poland applies this exception to all seabed habitats without attempting to say which specific habitats are affected by these two species. The exception needs to be more specific. Therefore, this assessment finds the provided justification partially grounded.  

•	Thirdly, in certain areas of the Baltic Sea, a regular decrease in oxygen occurs, which is regulated by occasional influx of water with high salinity and oxygen from areas of the Kattegat. Poland states that these conditions are natural and that the implementation of its conservation activities will not change or improve benthic habitats in these areas. 

If the oxygen levels are indeed natural, then there is nothing for the benthic habitats to recover from. However, the vast majority of oxygen depletion in the Baltic is considered to be due to nutrient enrichment (D5) with scientific papers showing the changes in extent of oxygen depletion over the past 100 years. Hence this justification is not found to be grounded.   

Even though Poland does not report an exception article in respect of seabed habitats, the explanations strongly indicate a link to exceptions under Article 14(1) (e) for the first and third justifications and 14(1)(a) for the second justification relating to NIS, as the Member State is not responsible for the spreading of NIS. This has not been clarified by the Member State. Overall, this assessment finds the exception partially grounded. ";Seabed habitats: Poland reports three reasons for its failure to achieve GES and targets for seabed habitats, mostly linked to natural conditions. The first relates to the slow recovery rates of benthic organisms and habitats which this assessment finds grounded, the second refers to two NIS which have spread significantly in Polish waters which is assessment finds partially grounded, and the third one refers to areas with naturally occurring seasonal low oxygen levels which this assessment finds not grounded. As such, overall, this assessment finds the justifications for the application of this exception partially grounded. ;2;Justification partially grounded;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/3b819bdd-6dec-46b8-b2c4-e3bf7f254bf3/details
PT ;MED ;13;D1-B;Coverage of pressures;"Portugal reports mostly spatial protection measures for bird habitats for all three subdivisions (ME01-DV MPAs, ME12-D1, MEA12-DV). In the measure description, it refers to general measures, such as MPA designation and the extension of Natura 2000 sites. For the Continental subdivisions, it specifically highlights the protection of nesting populations for birds (ME12-D1). However, Portugal does not specify which human activities impact the bird habitats and it is thus unclear which activities and pressures are to be addressed by the measures. 

For the Continental subdivision, Portugal states its intention to address bird by-catch caused by fishing activities (ME12-D1). Therefore, fishing activities are addressed for this subdivision. 

Overall, pressures for birds are only partially addressed as incidental by-catch is only covered in one subdivision.

For GES, it states that the distribution and abundance of species should be in line with the geographical, climatic and physiographical conditions. The assessment finds that the measures address the general GES applicable to birds, as bird populations and habitats are protected. No GES has been defined for the Azores subdivision.

Portugal updated its targets for the Continental subdivisions for birds for its 2014 Article 11 reporting. Target Cont.15 will be covered by the measures, as they address nesting populations of cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) on the Berlenga islands. Target Cont.16 will also be addressed, as the Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus) will also be protected through the measures.

PT ;MED ;13;D1-F;Coverage of GES and targets;"The GES definition does not specifically refer to fish biodiversity and Portugal does not provide much information for its fish biodiversity measures. It is not clear whether the measures reported by Portugal for fish will be sufficient to achieve GES and Portugal only refers to CFP measures and MPAs. Thus, it is uncertain if non-commercial fish species will be sufficiently addressed. Therefore, the PoM partially supports the achievement of GES for fish. Portugal did not report GES for fish biodiversity for the Azores subdivision.

Portugal’s only target for the Continental subdivision refers to the biomass level of the sardine stock (Cont.1). Even though the reported biodiversity measures do not specifically mention the protection of sardines, Portugal reports measures for D3 which address this species. It is therefore likely that this target is addressed through the measures.

The reported targets for fish for the Madeira subdivision are rather general, referring to monitoring programmes, improvement of knowledge and environmental studies (Mad.1, 3-6). These targets are addressed by the PoM, with several measures including monitoring programmes and research studies. Target Mad.7 refers to an increase in MPAs in Madeiran waters, which is also addressed through the MPA and Natura 2000 measures of the PoM.

The Azores target refers to obtaining information on representative coastal species, as indicators of the environmental status of the ecosystem, including coastal fish (Az.1). As the PoM includes a number of monitoring measures, this target will be addressed.

Portugal states its intention to develop protection measures based on the monitoring results. It is unclear whether the incidental by-catch measures, based on the Council Regulation (EC) 812/2004, are sufficiently developed to achieve GES. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses GES. Here again, no GES has been defined for the Azores. 

Portugal reports two new targets for the Continental subdivision. Target Cont.17 addresses the distribution of cetacean species protected by the Habitats Directive, however, Portugal does not specify which species the PoM measures cover; therefore, it cannot be assessed if all relevant species will be covered. Target Cont.18 refers to the protection of populations of the harbour porpoise and common bottlenose dolphin. Portugal specifically addresses these two species through its measures, although the measures refer largely to monitoring and testing of by-catch reducing fishing gear. The existing target Cont. 8 refers to an increase in monitoring networks, which is addressed by the PoM. 

For Madeira, Portugal reports targets Mad.1 and 6, which both define an overall improvement of knowledge of the marine environment and an increase in monitoring networks. As several measures cover monitoring and research activities, this target will be addressed through the PoM. Target Mad.7 aims to expand the MPAs in Madeiran waters, which will be addressed through Portugal’s MPA measures.

PT ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Portugal does not report any measures in which water column habitats and species are directly addressed. Two measures reported for water column habitats link to national, international and regional biodiversity regulations and conventions and MSP. While these measures may aim to reduce impacts on water column habitats, this cannot be clearly assessed. Furthermore, it is likely that measures reported under other descriptors (i.e. D5, D8) contribute to a reduction of pressures for this habitat. However, Portugal did not link these measures to water column habitats. Therefore, the measures partially address the pressure. 

At a regional level, Portugal links one OSPAR fisheries measure to its water column habitat PoM.

Portugal's measures primarily relate to the assessment of impacts on seabed habitats through a number of its existing fisheries and horizontal MPA measures, together with measures linked to national, international and regional biodiversity agreements. However, its PoM does not specify whether the measures address physical damage or loss nor is much information provided on how the measures will reduce impacts on seabed habitats. Overall, all new measures reported for seabed habitats by Portugal refer to monitoring and research activities, rather than protecting habitats. 

At a regional level, Portugal reported the pressure physical loss caused by fisheries, marine mining, dredging, port operations and submarine cables/pipeline operations as relevant for its Continental and Macaronesian waters in its Article 8 reporting. As stated above, the information provided for the reported measures does not allow concluding whether the measures directly address the physical loss of seabed habitats.  

Portugal also reported physical damage caused by dredging and fisheries as relevant activities in its Article 8 reporting in both subregions. Again, it is not possible to definitively assess from the PoM whether the measures will address this pressure. Portugal does not specifically refer to addressing dredging activities in its PoM. 

Spain and France also identify physical loss and damages as relevant pressures in their marine waters. They especially mention dredging, land claim/coastal defence, submarine cables/pipeline operations, solid waste disposal and port operations as relevant for causing physical loss, as well as fisheries and dredging to also cause physical damage. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether these pressures are also relevant for Portugal in this subregion.

Portugal does not report targets for water column habitats, making it impossible to assess targets for this habitat.

As most of the seabed habitat measures cover monitoring and research activities rather than protection or conservation activities, it is unlikely that the measures will contribute towards the achievement of GES. MPA, biodiversity and fisheries measures may contribute to seabed habitat protection; however, the level of detail reported for the measures does not allow an assessment on this. 

The Continent target Cont.8 refers to an improvement of the monitoring network, which will be addressed through the monitoring measure for the Continental subdivision, aiming to characterise benthic macrofauna and sea-floor integrity.

The Madeira targets Mad.1, 3-6 also refer to improved monitoring, research and knowledge gathering, which will be covered by numerous monitoring-related measures for the Madeira subdivision. The target Mad.7 links to an extension of the MPA area in Madeiran waters, which is also addressed by the PoM.

It is not clear whether target Az.10 will be covered by the PoM, as it aims to ensure that the exploitation of coastal resources does not affect known maerl communities; however, Portugal does not specifically mention maerl in its PoM.

Portugal reported the measures to address the pressure ‘extraction of species’ caused by fisheries, for all subdivisions. These include existing fisheries regulation measures linked to the CFP and existing and new MSP, as well as ME01-DV environmental management measures (MECMAD02-DV, MECMAD03-DV). 

Portugal also reports a number of measures which will aim to protect fish species and their habitats through MPA designations and management and by applying national, international and regional biodiversity regulations and conventions (ME01-DV, MEA12-DV). 

However, the Portuguese measures focus mainly on commercial fishing activities; therefore, it is not clear to what extent non-commercial species will be protected. Therefore, the measures partially address the pressures.

Portugal reports a number of measures that aim to reduce the incidental by-catch of marine mammals by fishing activities in all subdivisions. For the continental subdivision, it particularly focuses on by-catch of the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) (ME13-D1).

Portugal also reports a large number of general spatial protection measures that will likely contribute to protecting mammal habitats, including migratory pathways of migratory species. The measures mostly link to MPA designations and management (ME01-DV, ME13-D1, MEMAD06-D4, MEMAD07-D1, MECMAD07- D1). Nevertheless, impact from ships on marine mammals and activities causing underwater noise are not addressed through Portugal’s PoM.

PT ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
The GES definition does not specifically refer to fish biodiversity and Portugal does not provide much information for its fish biodiversity measures. It is not clear whether the measures reported by Portugal for fish will be sufficient to achieve GES and Portugal only refers to CFP measures and MPAs. Thus, it is uncertain if non-commercial fish species will be sufficiently addressed. Therefore, the PoM partially supports the achievement of GES for fish. Portugal did not report GES for fish biodiversity for the Azores subdivision.

Portugal’s only target for the Continental subdivision refers to the biomass level of the sardine stock (Cont.1). Even though the reported biodiversity measures do not specifically mention the protection of sardines, Portugal reports measures for D3 which address this species. It is therefore likely that this target is addressed through the measures.

The reported targets for fish for the Madeira subdivision are rather general, referring to monitoring programmes, improvement of knowledge and environmental studies (Mad.1, 3-6). These targets are addressed by the PoM, with several measures including monitoring programmes and research studies. Target Mad.7 refers to an increase in MPAs in Madeiran waters, which is also addressed through the MPA and Natura 2000 measures of the PoM.

The Azores target refers to obtaining information on representative coastal species, as indicators of the environmental status of the ecosystem, including coastal fish (Az.1). As the PoM includes a number of monitoring measures, this target will be addressed.

The PoM mainly covers by-catch of marine mammals. Most measures for specific marine mammals, covering harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena and Phocoena phocoena meridionalis), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) and monk seals (Monachus monachus) focus on monitoring and data collection. Portugal states its intention to develop protection measures based on the monitoring results. It is unclear whether the incidental by-catch measures, based on the Council Regulation (EC) 812/2004, are sufficiently developed to achieve GES. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses GES. Here again, no GES has been defined for the Azores. 

Portugal reports two new targets for the Continental subdivision. Target Cont.17 addresses the distribution of cetacean species protected by the Habitats Directive, however, Portugal does not specify which species the PoM measures cover; therefore, it cannot be assessed if all relevant species will be covered. Target Cont.18 refers to the protection of populations of the harbour porpoise and common bottlenose dolphin. Portugal specifically addresses these two species through its measures, although the measures refer largely to monitoring and testing of by-catch reducing fishing gear. The existing target Cont. 8 refers to an increase in monitoring networks, which is addressed by the PoM. 

For Madeira, Portugal reports targets Mad.1 and 6, which both define an overall improvement of knowledge of the marine environment and an increase in monitoring networks. As several measures cover monitoring and research activities, this target will be addressed through the PoM. Target Mad.7 aims to expand the MPAs in Madeiran waters, which will be addressed through Portugal’s MPA measures.

The only Azores target Az.3 refers to an increase in knowledge of the population dynamics of migratory pelagic species, such as sea turtles and cetaceans. This will not be addressed by the PoM, as the only measure linked to the study of migratory pelagic species is reported for the Madeira subdivision rather than for the Azores. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment
Fish: The measures partially address the GES and targets definitions, as measures link mostly to the CFP, making it unclear if non-commercial fish species will be covered. They address the targets because the biomass level of the sardine stock is covered through a D3 measure for the Continental subdivision and monitoring measures sufficiently address the Madeira and Azores targets. 
Mammals: The measures partially support the achievement of the Continental targets, as the measures cover mostly monitoring and research measures and are thus unlikely to be sufficient to address population protection. It is not clear if the PoM addresses all cetacean species defined by the Continental targets. The targets for the Madeira and Azores subdivision are addressed through monitoring measures.

Portugal does not report any measures in which water column habitats and species are directly addressed. Two measures reported for water column habitats link to national, international and regional biodiversity regulations and conventions and MSP. While these measures may aim to reduce impacts on water column habitats, this cannot be clearly assessed. Furthermore, it is likely that measures reported under other descriptors (i.e. D5, D8) contribute to a reduction of pressures for this habitat. However, Portugal did not link these measures to water column habitats. Therefore, the measures partially address the pressure. 

At a regional level, Portugal links one OSPAR fisheries measure to its water column habitat PoM.

Portugal's measures primarily relate to the assessment of impacts on seabed habitats through a number of its existing fisheries and horizontal MPA measures, together with measures linked to national, international and regional biodiversity agreements. However, its PoM does not specify whether the measures address physical damage or loss nor is much information provided on how the measures will reduce impacts on seabed habitats. Overall, all new measures reported for seabed habitats by Portugal refer to monitoring and research activities, rather than protecting habitats. 

At a regional level, Portugal reported the pressure physical loss caused by fisheries, marine mining, dredging, port operations and submarine cables/pipeline operations as relevant for its Continental and Macaronesian waters in its Article 8 reporting. As stated above, the information provided for the reported measures does not allow concluding whether the measures directly address the physical loss of seabed habitats.  

Portugal also reported physical damage caused by dredging and fisheries as relevant activities in its Article 8 reporting in both subregions. Again, it is not possible to definitively assess from the PoM whether the measures will address this pressure. Portugal does not specifically refer to addressing dredging activities in its PoM. 

Spain and France also identify physical loss and damages as relevant pressures in their marine waters. They especially mention dredging, land claim/coastal defence, submarine cables/pipeline operations, solid waste disposal and port operations as relevant for causing physical loss, as well as fisheries and dredging to also cause physical damage. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether these pressures are also relevant for Portugal in this subregion. 

Based on the reported information by the Member State, the necessary pressures and related activities for seabed habitats are not sufficiently covered by the PoM.

These activities are mainly tackled within MPAs, which are in some cases tailored to the needs of important migratory seabird species (measure RO-MN-003). The extraction of species in the form of incidental bycatch from fisheries is directly addressed by several measures, both within MPAs but also in a more horizontal way, including incentives for switching to fishing techniques that reduce seabird bycatch rates. MSP regulation is used to cover human activities and their impact along the coastline. 

The PoM addresses pressures on seabirds, although the description of the spatial protection measures (which are the only ones reported, apart from those on bycatch) lacks detail and does not allow for a very precise assessment.

RO ;BLK ;13;D1-F;Coverage of GES and targets;"The GES definition for fish focuses on the maintenance of the natural species distribution, and their functional and spatial connectivity. Romania also aims to maintain non-commercial species’ population size and status, focusing on the Gobiidae family, as well as the general abundance of small pelagic species, including the proportion of their population at sexual maturity. 

The four targets closely mirror the GES definition, focusing on the maintenance of the distribution area, population abundance, demographic characteristics (age/sexual maturity) and trends of functionally important groups. They are all focused on the Gobiidae family, already mentioned in the GES definition.

GES and targets focus on the Gobiidae family, which is not directly addressed by any of the measures. This family of fish species is used as a horizontal indicator of the status of non-commercial pelagic fish. They have a very important role in marine food webs as they are the main food source of several larger fish species. Due to their small size, bycatch does not impact population sizes to a great extent, but the limitation and reduction of human-related pressures is of key importance for the achievement of GES and targets. The measures only indirectly address threats to the Gobiidae family by reducing pressures in protected areas and, through measures on bycatch, also address maintenance of the populations of larger non-commercial species.

This assessment therefore finds that GES and targets for fish are partially addressed.";GES and targets are partially addressed. While both GES and targets focus on the Gobiidae family, which is not directly covered by the measures, the PoM still provides a protective framework for this group of species by reducing several pressures in MPAs, which often match their breeding zones (it therefore only indirectly covers these species).

In general, Romania does not establish quantifiable values for its GES or targets.

Romania provides more detail in its target for water column habitats, aiming to keep summer phytoplankton biomass below 10% of the threshold observed during the last six years.

Given the vague definition of the GES and targets, it is not possible to determine the specific value of the threshold established, nor to determine what could be considered ‘significant influence’ on water column habitats. Some impacts are reduced by the reported measures, but these are limited to MPAs.

Thus, this assessment considers that the PoM partially addresses GES and targets for water column habitats.

Romania defined GES for seabed habitats very extensively, aiming to maintain distribution and avoid habitat fragmentation, including for seagrass (Zostera noltei), brown algae (Cystoseira barbata) and sand banks with shellfish (Donax trunculus and Mytilus galloprovincialis), along several locations on the Romanian coastline (Vama Veche, Cap Aurora, Costinest, etc.). Romania also reports indicators on the state of these and other benthic species and habitats, such as leaf height, relative biomass and abundance, population, habitat coverage, and even sand granulometry, to provide quantitative thresholds of environmental quality.

RO ;BLK ;13;D4;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Romania identified the extraction of species by fisheries as the most important pressure on non-commercial fish. This pressure is directly addressed by several measures addressing fisheries, such as developing technical and spatial restrictions to reduce bycatch rates. 

The spatial protection measures reported by Romania - addressing all species and habitat groups - provide a general protective framework for fish habitats against several human pressures, such as contamination or NIS, and from activities like shipping, aquaculture or tourism. 

Pressures on fish are addressed by the PoM.

At a regional level, Romania links its PoM to the Black Sea Convention.

Romania reports several measures to develop MPAs for all species and habitats, including specific protected areas for mammals (RO-MN-002). The pressures addressed in these protected areas cover contaminants, seabed erosion, underwater noise and marine litter, although little detail is provided on how these pressures are tackled in practice. Among the activities covered, Romania includes tourism, discharges from urban areas (waste water treatment), dredging, hydrocarbon extraction, shipping, aquaculture and fishing. Again, little detail is provided on how these activities are covered or the restrictions that may apply to them.

Incidental bycatch is covered by several broad measures implementing technical and geographical restrictions intended to reduce this pressure directly.

Mortality of cetaceans (ship collision for example) is also directly addressed by a measure aiming to lower the number of deaths by treating injured animals, but also through efforts to monitor and research the main causes or activities damaging these animals in order to provide more effective management plans in the future.

The PoM addresses pressures on mammals.

At regional level, Romania links its PoM for mammals to the Black Sea Convention and to ACCOBAMS.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Fish: The pressures are addressed, since the extraction of non-commercial species by fisheries (bycatch), and for other purposes, is broadly addressed by the PoM. Other relevant pressures are also tackled (such as contamination or NIS), although mainly within MPAs.

Mammals: Pressures for mammals are addressed. Transversal impacts on mammals are covered by a series of tailored MPAs, in which activities that may threaten these animals are restricted (reducing underground noise, marine litter, etc.). Several measures directly address bycatch and reducing the mortality or injury rates of cetaceans. This is strengthened by another measure to develop a network for rescuing injured animals, preventing further deaths and researching these impacts.

RO ;BLK ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
The GES definition for fish focuses on the maintenance of the natural species distribution, and their functional and spatial connectivity. Romania also aims to maintain non-commercial species’ population size and status, focusing on the Gobiidae family, as well as the general abundance of small pelagic species, including the proportion of their population at sexual maturity. 

The four targets closely mirror the GES definition, focusing on the maintenance of the distribution area, population abundance, demographic characteristics (age/sexual maturity) and trends of functionally important groups. They are all focused on the Gobiidae family, already mentioned in the GES definition.

GES and targets focus on the Gobiidae family, which is not directly addressed by any of the measures. This family of fish species is used as a horizontal indicator of the status of non-commercial pelagic fish. They have a very important role in marine food webs as they are the main food source of several larger fish species. Due to their small size, bycatch does not impact population sizes to a great extent, but the limitation and reduction of human-related pressures is of key importance for the achievement of GES and targets. The measures only indirectly address threats to the Gobiidae family by reducing pressures in protected areas and, through measures on bycatch, also address maintenance of the populations of larger non-commercial species.

This assessment therefore finds that GES and targets for fish are partially addressed.

Romania defined GES for mammals as the population levels at which individuals of the three main species of dolphins are encountered ‘frequently’ in all parts of their territorial sea, not only in isolated areas but also near major sources of pressures, such as cities or busy bays. GES also establishes that observations of dead individuals must be ‘extremely rare’.

Romania lists only two targets for mammals. Target 1.1.1 aims to conserve the distribution range of the three dolphin species present in their sea by means of ‘appropriate management measures’. Target 4.3.1 aims to reduce their bycatch levels.

In general, Romania does not establish quantifiable values for its GES or targets. It can nevertheless be concluded that the reported measures will work towards the achievement of GES and targets, as the main threats to cetaceans are addressed, thus ensuring their normal distribution and preventing/limiting damage to these animals.

Fish: GES and targets are partially addressed. While both GES and targets focus on the Gobiidae family, which is not directly covered by the measures, the PoM still provides a protective framework for this group of species by reducing several pressures in MPAs, which often match their breeding zones (it therefore only indirectly covers these species). Larger fish are also protected by several measures addressing bycatch impacts from fishing activities. 

Mammals: GES and targets are addressed.

Fisheries are also addressed by the National Environmental Code, which includes regulations on fish hunting, aquaculture, closure of fishing zones (i.e. temporal or seasonal), and protection of areas with vulnerable fish species. The HELCOM BSAP aims to take all of the measures necessary to ensure that populations of all commercially-exploited fish species remain within safe biological limits and reach MSY, in addition to the rapid implementation of the existing long-term management plans for cod and eel. Sweden does not, however, specify the actions to be taken to implement the BSAP. A number of new measures to manage fisheries through more selective fishing methods, closure periods and areas and the designation of MPAs to protect fish species, are also reported by Sweden (M004-9).

Hunting, as reported by Sweden, is likely to include recreational wild fishing and is addressed by the measures through the implementation of the National Environmental Code and the National Hunting Act. 

Similar to birds, the measures addressing the pressures of other descriptors are included here as relevant for biodiversity of fish species. The pressures covered are those that change hydrographical conditions (M013, M014), marine litter (M019-23) and micro-litter (M020), NIS (M001-3, M040-41), eutrophication (M010-12) and contaminants (M015).

In addition, a number of existing measures aim to protect mammal species and habitats. These range from the implementation of the Habitats and Birds Directives to RSC guidelines. Sweden refers to OSPAR, the HELCOM BSAP and the ASCOBANS. 

The new measures (24 to 28) also aim to protect threatened mammal species in Swedish waters, through protection plans for threatened species, research and spatial protection measures. Sweden reports that these measures will contribute towards reducing by-catch of marine mammals. Also, Sweden reports that under the horizontal measures of its environmental code it implements measures that restrict fishing and hunting in seal habitat areas.

SE ;BAL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Sweden does not report any measure for water column habitats linked to biodiversity, MPAs or environmental restoration. Nevertheless, its PoM includes a number of measures linked to other descriptors which are relevant for water column habitats. These address impacts on hydrological conditions (M013), the extraction of species (M004-9), non-indigenous species (M001-3, M040-41), eutrophication (M010) and contamination (M015, M017, M018). These pressures are all relevant for water column habitats and therefore addressed for this habitat. 

The pressure extraction of species is addressed by existing measures linked to fisheries management, such as those regulating and restricting bottom trawling in certain areas, national implementation of the CFP, the National Environmental Code and national fisheries legislation. The National Environmental Code specifically states that fishing activities should consider aquatic molluscs and crustaceans. Furthermore, the new MPA measures also aim to reduce fishing pressures on sensitive seabed habitats (M026-28).

For seabed habitats, Sweden also reports a number of measures primarily linked to other descriptors, and pressures covered under those, such as changes in hydrographical conditions (M013, M014), the introduction of non-indigenous species (M001-3, M040-41), nutrient enrichment (M010-12) and the introduction of contaminants (M015, M-17, M018).  

The pressure ‘physical damage’ is addressed by three new measures (27 – 29). These measures link to MSP, the designation of MPAs, and management measures to reduce pressures for various biodiversity species. 

Sweden has not linked its new commercial fish and shellfish (D3) measures to seabed habitats, as measures M004 to M008 focus on populations of coastal fish and mainly within the national trawling limit which is already a ‘no trawl zone’. Reduced pressures on seafloor habitats may be a positive side effect of these measures, however, this is not their main purpose.

General impacts on seabed habitats will be addressed by the new measures 24 to 31, which cover protection plans for threatened species, spatial protection measures, and protection and restoration of benthic habitats. Sweden reports one specific measure on the implementation of restoration measures for seagrass beds (Zostera marina) in Swedish North Sea coastal waters. It also links its PoM to the OSPAR list of threatened and declining species and habitats and the HELCOM BSAP.  

At the subregional level, Sweden identified the same pressures and relevant activities for both the Baltic and North Seas in its Article 8 reporting. It identified physical loss to be a relevant pressure, caused by dredging, marine-based renewable energy, port operations, land claim and solid waste disposal. While these activities are not specifically mentioned in its PoM, it is likely that they will be addressed by MSP plans that consider MPA objectives. This remains uncertain, however, and cannot be assessed. Sweden reports physical damage as a pressure caused by fisheries, tourism and shipping. Its PoM addresses fisheries, while the MPA measures (M026-28) offer the main tools for reducing impact from bottom-trawl fishing on targeted habitats and species. Notwithstanding these, shipping and tourism/recreational (that is likely to be associated with shipping) activities are not specifically addressed by the PoM. It is therefore assessed as partially addressing the pressures for seabed habitats.

Once again, Sweden specifically links its measures to OSPAR and HELCOM guidelines. ";"Water column habitats: The pressures are addressed, given that the measures focus mainly on pressures relevant under other descriptors, which are indicated as relevant for water column habitats too (incl. D2, D3, D5, D8 etc.). 
Seabed habitats: The measures address dredging and bottom-trawl fishing activities in MPAs. Bottom-trawl fishing activities will also be covered by D3 measures. Activities such as renewable energy, solid waste disposal and shipping are likely to be managed through spatial protection measures; however, little information is provided by Sweden. Physical damage caused by shipping and tourism (that is likely to be associated with shipping) are not addressed. Therefore, the measures partially address seabed habitat pressures.

SE ;BAL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Sweden does not define the GES or targets for water column habitats, therefore no assessment can be provided.  

The Swedish GES for seabed habitats focuses on the Benthic Quality Index (BQI) for coastal and outer waters, i.e. benthic fauna and macro-invertebrates. It also links to sea-floor integrity and a sustainable level of physical impact by aggregate extraction. Sweden’s PoM specifically refers to macro-vegetation, such as seagrass beds, and aims to protect these habitats. Measures linked to OSPAR and HELCOM activities, together with further national spatial protection measures, will contribute towards achieving GES. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether the reported measures will be sufficient to achieve all GES components; therefore the PoM partially supports the achievement of GES. 

Swedish targets also address seabed habitats, and it aims to decrease the area of the seabed affected by various human activities (i.e. trawling, permanent structures, dredging, dumping and the extraction of non-living resources). These activities are likely to be covered by the new measures linked to MSP and MPA designations, however, this is not specifically reported and thus cannot be assessed. A further target links to the protection of biogenic substrate, several types of which are protected by the Habitats Directive, and OSPAR and HELCOM lists of protected species. Based on the limited information on the measures, however, the extent to which the targets will be addressed remains uncertain, thus the measures partially address the targets.

One measure focuses on the reduction of lost fishing gear at sea, which is a particular concern for marine mammals as a frequent cause of injury or death (M019). 

In addition, a number of existing measures aim to protect mammal species and habitats. These range from the implementation of the Habitats and Birds Directives to RSC guidelines. Sweden refers to OSPAR, the HELCOM BSAP and the ASCOBANS. 

The new measures (24 to 28) also aim to protect threatened mammal species in Swedish waters, through protection plans for threatened species, research and spatial protection measures. Sweden reports that these measures will contribute towards reducing by-catch of marine mammals. Also, Sweden reports that under the horizontal measures of its environmental code it implements measures that restrict fishing and hunting in seal habitat areas. Nevertheless, regarding the harbour porpoise Sweden states that by-catch cannot fully be addressed by national measures, as it considers international work essential to address this pressure.

As Sweden does not report measures covering underwater noise or contaminants impacts, the relevant pressures for mammals are partially addressed. 

At a regional level, Sweden links a number of measures to OSPAR and HELCOM, addressing pressures as listed above.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Fish: the measures cover the pressure ‘extraction of species caused by fisheries and hunting’, in addition to contaminants, marine litter and eutrophication.

SE ;BAL ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Sweden defines GES for fish through abundance, biomass and size structure of key species. Fisheries management and hunting regulations in the PoM will contribute towards the achievement of the GES, as relevant pressures are covered to support the achievement of the GES components. GES is covered by the measures. 

Most of the biodiversity targets reported by Sweden link to fish. Like the GES, the targets link to abundance, biomass and length and size structure. Again, these aspects are likely to be covered by the measures that cover both commercial species (through links to the CFP) and species that are not commercially important species (through spatial protection and habitat restoring measures). Targets are therefore covered by the measures.

Sweden defines its GES for mammals by referring to growth rates of mammals, various aspects of seal health (i.e. distribution, blubber thickness, pregnancy rates) and harbour porpoises (distribution range, abundance). Sweden links its PoM to a number of international and EU regulations that aim to protect these two species (i.e. Habitats Directive, ASCOBANS, HELCOM, OSPAR). Furthermore, spatial protection measures can also contribute to mammal GES and it is likely that relevant species are addressed by these measures. Furthermore, Sweden reports to protect seal habitats from fishing and hunting activities. Therefore, the PoM addresses GES for mammals.

Sweden does not report targets for mammals, making an assessment against targets impossible. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment

Sweden states that biodiversity (D1) and food webs (D4) are affected by all pressures relevant under other descriptors, thus GES can only be achieved for D1 if it is also achieved for all other descriptors. It goes on to state that current knowledge levels do not allow for an estimate of the full effect of the measures on the achievement of GES. The fact that Sweden makes a strong link between pressure and state descriptors is a strength within its PoM, and it is true that the achievement of other descriptors’ GES is important to achieving GES for D1 and D4. However, a more robust approach would be to Sweden should not limit the biodiversity descriptors to their impacts from other descriptors but should, rather, develop a comprehensive PoM specific to the biodiversity descriptors, to protect and restore biodiversity components in Swedish waters. Sweden reports two measures specific to biodiversity, three MPA measures and three restoration measures (M029-31). 

For seabed integrity (D6) Sweden reports that the achievement of GES is mainly inhibited by knowledge gaps regarding the distribution and conditions of certain seabed habitats (including reefs). It also refers to knowledge gaps as a major element in relation to the reasons why GES for D6 might not be achieved.

Timeline for implementation of the PoM
Sweden does not report a timeline for the existing measures. A timeline is provided for most new measures, one of which was implemented by 2015 (M026), and most of which will be implemented by 2016 (M001-9, M010, M013-15, M019-21, M021, M027, M031), 2017 (M022) or 2020 (M016).

SE ;BAL ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Sweden does not report any measure for water column habitats linked to biodiversity, MPAs or environmental restoration. Nevertheless, its PoM includes a number of measures linked to other descriptors which are relevant for water column habitats. These address impacts on hydrological conditions (M013), the extraction of species (M004-9), non-indigenous species (M001-3, M040-41), eutrophication (M010) and contamination (M015, M017, M018). These pressures are all relevant for water column habitats and therefore addressed for this habitat. 

The pressure extraction of species is addressed by existing measures linked to fisheries management, such as those regulating and restricting bottom trawling in certain areas, national implementation of the CFP, the National Environmental Code and national fisheries legislation. The National Environmental Code specifically states that fishing activities should consider aquatic molluscs and crustaceans. Furthermore, the new MPA measures also aim to reduce fishing pressures on sensitive seabed habitats (M026-28).

For seabed habitats, Sweden also reports a number of measures primarily linked to other descriptors, and pressures covered under those, such as changes in hydrographical conditions (M013, M014), the introduction of non-indigenous species (M001-3, M040-41), nutrient enrichment (M010-12) and the introduction of contaminants (M015, M-17, M018).  

The pressure ‘physical damage’ is addressed by three new measures (27 – 29). These measures link to MSP, the designation of MPAs, and management measures to reduce pressures for various biodiversity species. 

Sweden has not linked its new commercial fish and shellfish (D3) measures to seabed habitats, as measures M004 to M008 focus on populations of coastal fish and mainly within the national trawling limit which is already a ‘no trawl zone’. Reduced pressures on seafloor habitats may be a positive side effect of these measures, however, this is not their main purpose.

General impacts on seabed habitats will be addressed by the new measures 24 to 31, which cover protection plans for threatened species, spatial protection measures, and protection and restoration of benthic habitats. Sweden reports one specific measure on the implementation of restoration measures for seagrass beds (Zostera marina) in Swedish North Sea coastal waters. It also links its PoM to the OSPAR list of threatened and declining species and habitats and the HELCOM BSAP.  

At the subregional level, Sweden identified the same pressures and relevant activities for both the Baltic and North Seas in its Article 8 reporting. It identified physical loss to be a relevant pressure, caused by dredging, marine-based renewable energy, port operations, land claim and solid waste disposal. While these activities are not specifically mentioned in its PoM, it is likely that they will be addressed by MSP plans that consider MPA objectives. This remains uncertain, however, and cannot be assessed. Sweden reports physical damage as a pressure caused by fisheries, tourism and shipping. Its PoM addresses fisheries, while the MPA measures (M026-28) offer the main tools for reducing impact from bottom-trawl fishing on targeted habitats and species. Notwithstanding these, shipping and tourism/recreational (that is likely to be associated with shipping) activities are not specifically addressed by the PoM. It is therefore assessed as partially addressing the pressures for seabed habitats.

Once again, Sweden specifically links its measures to OSPAR and HELCOM guidelines. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: The pressures are addressed, given that the measures focus mainly on pressures relevant under other descriptors, which are indicated as relevant for water column habitats too (incl. D2, D3, D5, D8 etc.). 

Seabed habitats: The measures address dredging and bottom-trawl fishing activities in MPAs. Bottom-trawl fishing activities will also be covered by D3 measures. Activities such as renewable energy, solid waste disposal and shipping are likely to be managed through spatial protection measures; however, little information is provided by Sweden. Physical damage caused by shipping and tourism (that is likely to be associated with shipping) are not addressed. Therefore, the measures partially address seabed habitat pressures.

SE ;BAL ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Sweden does not define the GES or targets for water column habitats, therefore no assessment can be provided.  

The Swedish GES for seabed habitats focuses on the Benthic Quality Index (BQI) for coastal and outer waters, i.e. benthic fauna and macro-invertebrates. It also links to sea-floor integrity and a sustainable level of physical impact by aggregate extraction. Sweden’s PoM specifically refers to macro-vegetation, such as seagrass beds, and aims to protect these habitats. Measures linked to OSPAR and HELCOM activities, together with further national spatial protection measures, will contribute towards achieving GES. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether the reported measures will be sufficient to achieve all GES components; therefore the PoM partially supports the achievement of GES. 

Swedish targets also address seabed habitats, and it aims to decrease the area of the seabed affected by various human activities (i.e. trawling, permanent structures, dredging, dumping and the extraction of non-living resources). These activities are likely to be covered by the new measures linked to MSP and MPA designations, however, this is not specifically reported and thus cannot be assessed. A further target links to the protection of biogenic substrate, several types of which are protected by the Habitats Directive, and OSPAR and HELCOM lists of protected species. Based on the limited information on the measures, however, the extent to which the targets will be addressed remains uncertain, thus the measures partially address the targets.

SI ;MED ;13;D1-B;Coverage of pressures;"Slovenia reports spatial protection measures and some measures directly addressing fisheries, including recreational fishing. Decreasing general fishing pressure will, as a side effect, potentially reduce bird by-catch and improve the state of their food web by increasing the total amount of fish available. Still, by-catch by itself is not directly tackled by the measures.

 No measures are reported in biodiversity (D1, 4, 6) addressing any other pressures on birds, such as NIS, predation on their nesting sites, light and noise pollution, or marine litter which may be important factors in the long-term viability of bird populations. However, Slovenia clarified that while no link was provided in the PoM, the impact of these pressures on birds are addressed by various measures reported for other descriptors (e.g. D2, D10 and D11).

SI ;MED ;13;D1-B;Coverage of GES and targets;"Slovenia defined GES as: the maintenance of ecosystem functioning; the quality and presence of habitats; and the distribution and abundance of species in accordance with baselines defined in the initial assessment and prevailing physiographical, geographical and climatic conditions. The GES definition does not refer specifically to any species and does not mention birds beyond a reference to the Birds Directive.

Although there are no measures directly addressing birds, the PoM provides general spatial protection measures and measures to reduce pressures from fisheries, which may improve the status of bird populations by improving their food sources (fish availability) and potentially reducing accidental by-catch. However, the PoM does not provide much detail on how these measures will achieve GES for birds. While Slovenia states that more information is available in legislation implementing the MSFD and other Directives such as Birds or Habitats, this assessment only relied on the information directly reported in the PoM.

Slovenia provided 16 general biodiversity targets (seven for D1, four for D4 and five for D6). Target 1.1 specifically concerns bird species and focuses on the distribution and status of species that should be in line with the objectives of the Birds Directive. Two bird species are mentioned: the common tern (Sterna hirundo) and the little tern (Sternula albifrons), aiming to preserve their habitat and to maintain stable populations. The PoM does not specifically address these two species but provides spatial protection measures (Natura 2000 areas) and measures preventing stress from hydromorphological changes. However, Slovenia explained that these species are directly addressed in the legislation mentioned in the PoM for measure D1,3,4,6,7: TU6. Another target (1.5) focuses on the establishment of protected areas in Slovenian waters and the Adriatic in 2020. This is also relevant for birds and is likely to be addressed by general spatial protection measures (e.g. D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU1 and D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU6).

The reported measures partially address GES and targets for birds, as some degree of protection to birds will be granted. However, while the targets are addressed, the measures do not clearly explain how GES will be achieved.

SI ;MED ;13;D1-F;Coverage of pressures;"Slovenia identified the extraction of species from commercial and recreational fisheries as the only pressure relevant for non-commercial fish and cephalopod species. The PoM addresses this pressure through measures stemming from the CFP, together with a measure specifically addressing recreational fishing. Non-commercial species are indirectly covered through the monitoring of by-catch landings from commercial fisheries, although they will also be positively affected by the general reduction in fishing effort planned within the framework of the CFP. Still, these measures will only indirectly, or as a side-effect, address by-catch of non-commercial species, which is the main threat to non-commercial fish.

The measures reported as especially relevant for fish and cephalopods under biodiversity (D1, 4, 6) do not seem to address any other pressure. While not stated in the PoM, Slovenia clarified that pressures on fish and cephalopods such as NIS, contaminants or marine litter are addressed by measures reported under other descriptors (i.e. D2, D8 and D10).
 
Given the lack of measures directly addressing by-catch of non-commercial species, this assessment considers the pressures to be partially addressed.

SI ;MED ;13;D1-F;Coverage of GES and targets;"Similar to birds, Slovenia defined GES for fish and cephalopods in a general manner, setting species, habitats and ecosystems functions and distributions as features to be maintained in accordance with natural conditions and baselines defined in the initial assessment. This definition does not refer to any particular species, nor does it mention fish. Slovenia provides a GES definition for food webs (D4), which suggests that GES is achieved when all elements of food webs are at levels that can provide long-term abundance of species and the preservation of their full reproductive capacity. More specifically, the indicators concern the percentage of large fish (not detailing which species) which must be above a threshold to be defined in 2018, and the maintenance of good condition of key trophic groups and species. Slovenia’s PoM provides spatial protection measures (via Natura 2000 areas) and prevents hydromorphological stress generally for all species and habitats groups. CFP-related measures address reductions in the overall fishing effort, potentially reducing non-commercial species by-catch and including their monitoring in landing data collection. 

While the reported measures will improve the general state of fish and cephalopod populations, non-commercial species are only indirectly addressed via the monitoring of landing data. Therefore, the PoM’s impact on ‘large fish’ populations, which is the sole reference to fish made in the GES definition, if any, is an indirect one by means of the reduction of fishing morality. Thus, the PoM only partially addresses GES.  

Slovenia reports mostly general targets for habitats distribution, size and condition in accordance with the Habitats Directive. The only fish and shellfish species directly mentioned are the Pinna nobilis (target 1.3) and the cunner (target 1.4), whose population densities are used as indicators. However, these species are not directly addressed in the PoM. Slovenia explained that future steps could focus on the effectiveness analysis of the implementation of the measures to assess the need to upgrade the PoM or define new measures for biodiversity (D1, 4, 6) and more specifically on large fish, for achieving GES and targets. However, at present, given the lack of specificity of the PoM, it is not possible to ensure that the reported measures will be sufficient to achieve the targets. Since there are, nevertheless, measures providing spatial protection and potentially reducing by-catch by a lowering of fishing effort, the PoM is considered to partially cover the targets.";GES and targets are partially addressed through the PoM.

SI ;MED ;13;D1-C;Coverage of GES and targets;"Similar to birds, Slovenia defined GES for fish and cephalopods in a general manner, setting species, habitats and ecosystems functions and distributions as features to be maintained in accordance with natural conditions and baselines defined in the initial assessment. This definition does not refer to any particular species, nor does it mention fish. Slovenia provides a GES definition for food webs (D4), which suggests that GES is achieved when all elements of food webs are at levels that can provide long-term abundance of species and the preservation of their full reproductive capacity. More specifically, the indicators concern the percentage of large fish (not detailing which species) which must be above a threshold to be defined in 2018, and the maintenance of good condition of key trophic groups and species. Slovenia’s PoM provides spatial protection measures (via Natura 2000 areas) and prevents hydromorphological stress generally for all species and habitats groups. CFP-related measures address reductions in the overall fishing effort, potentially reducing non-commercial species by-catch and including their monitoring in landing data collection. 

While the reported measures will improve the general state of fish and cephalopod populations, non-commercial species are only indirectly addressed via the monitoring of landing data. Therefore, the PoM’s impact on ‘large fish’ populations, which is the sole reference to fish made in the GES definition, if any, is an indirect one by means of the reduction of fishing morality. Thus, the PoM only partially addresses GES.  

Slovenia reports mostly general targets for habitats distribution, size and condition in accordance with the Habitats Directive. The only fish and shellfish species directly mentioned are the Pinna nobilis (target 1.3) and the cunner (target 1.4), whose population densities are used as indicators. However, these species are not directly addressed in the PoM. Slovenia explained that future steps could focus on the effectiveness analysis of the implementation of the measures to assess the need to upgrade the PoM or define new measures for biodiversity (D1, 4, 6) and more specifically on large fish, for achieving GES and targets. However, at present, given the lack of specificity of the PoM, it is not possible to ensure that the reported measures will be sufficient to achieve the targets. Since there are, nevertheless, measures providing spatial protection and potentially reducing by-catch by a lowering of fishing effort, the PoM is considered to partially cover the targets.";GES and targets are partially addressed through the PoM. Measures reported by Slovenia relate mainly to commercial species. Non-commercial species are only addressed through by-catch landing data. It is not clear whether or not Pinna nobilis and cunner, the only species specifically referred to in the targets, are covered in the measures, which relate solely to spatial protection and commercial fishing restrictions. They are therefore not sufficient to ensure achievement of the targets.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/54b24d3b-c572-4f42-a273-1da098633c7b/details

SI ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"Slovenia did not identify any relevant pressure on water columns within its biodiversity measures. Some of the horizontal measures and some of the measures reported for the general biodiversity groups will reduce nutrient enrichment and pollution in water column habitats, although no specific activities are covered by them.

In addition, Slovenia clarified that pressures on water column habitats are addressed by measures reported under eutrophication (D5). While this link is considered reasonable, the PoM still does not specify how these measures will affect water column habitats., 

As such, the pressures on this group are only partially addressed.

In its Article 8 reporting, Slovenia identified physical loss and damage from land claim, coastal defence, port operations and tourism/recreational activities, as well as physical damage from fisheries (including recreational fishing) and shipping as relevant pressures for seabed integrity. 
Impacts from fisheries and recreational fishing are addressed by spatial protection measures, general reduction of fishing effort through the CFP (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU2) and the development of regulations on recreational fishing (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU5). Tourism, including yachting, and shipping are addressed by restrictions in anchoring, navigation and the management of mooring spots. Land claim, coastal defence and port operations are addressed via MSP measures (D1-D11: TU6), EIA (D1-D11: TU1) and ICZM measures (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU4). Overall, the PoM addresses the pressures on seabed habitats.

At the subregional level, physical loss and damage were identified as relevant pressures in their marine environments by Greece, Italy and Croatia. Most of the activities identified by Slovenia are also reported by a majority of the neighbouring Member States (land claim/coastal defence and port operations for physical loss, fisheries for physical damage). In addition, submarine cable and pipeline operations were identified by all of the other neighbouring Member States as causing physical loss. Slovenia did not include this in its Article 8 reporting, but it may be less relevant here, given its short coastline. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives concerns seafloor integrity: ‘Sea‐floor integrity is maintained, especially in priority benthic habitats’ (with associated operational objectives and indicators). The Plan Bleu Regional Activity Centre (one of the six UNEP/MAP’s Regional Advisory Committees, RACs) explains that, despite efforts, the Mediterranean Sea still faces several pressures, among which are the fishing methods destroying or disturbing the seafloor. Slovenia covers fishing impacts on seabed habitats in MPAs through its PoM and aims to reduce fishing effort generally, thus potentially improving the state of seabed habitats in Slovenian territorial waters as a whole. ";"Water column habitats: Pressures for water column habitats are partially addressed. While some of the main pressures are addressed through biodiversity as well as D5 measures, the general lack of information in the PoM on water column habitats cannot guarantee that all relevant pressures are addressed.

SI ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Slovenia defined a general GES for biodiversity, aiming to maintain species, habitats, key trophic groups and ecosystems’ functions and distributions, and abundance according to the state of the initial assessment and their natural conditions. Measures reported by Slovenia can reduce some threats to the achievement of GES. However, there are still elements, such as NIS, which could jeopardise species distribution yet are not considered within the measures relating to water column habitats. Also, the level of detail provided for those measures does not allow for certainty that all elements of the GES definition are covered. Therefore, GES is partially addressed.

Among the 16 targets defined for biodiversity, one (target 4.1) specifically mentions water column habitats and mesozooplankton and concerns the maintenance of ‘the biomass of mesozooplankton below a threshold’, which is not detailed. The new measure on strengthening research efforts to increase knowledge of marine habitats (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU8) may indirectly help to improve the setting of thresholds. Some of the horizontal measures can reduce the volumes of nutrients and pollutants discharged in the sea, reducing the occurrence of blooms. The target is therefore considered to be addressed.

Overall, the PoM partially covers GES and targets for water column habitats. 

Slovenia defined a general GES for seabed habitats and will consider it achieved when the integrity of the seabed is at a level that ensures the protection of the natural structure, scope, distribution and functions of the ecosystem, and where there are no long-term adverse effects on the benthic community. Existing spatial protection measures (Natura 2000) and measures aimed at reducing fishing pressure, as well as the new measure restricting anchoring and navigation, which also aim to improve the mapping of marine habitats, provide a general protection framework, addressing the main potential threats to seabed integrity and establishing the appropriate framework for the achievement of GES.

Slovenia defined five targets for seabed habitats in its PoM. Targets 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 aim to prevent deterioration of the status related to the biomass/abundance/range of the biogenic substrate, the extent of seabed (different types of substrates) that is highly influenced by human activities, and benthic communities, respectively. Target 6.4 focuses on identifying the distribution, cover and biomass of biogenic substrates, while target 6.5 specifically addresses the impact of physical damage on biogenic substrate due to fishing. Under the targets defined for D1, Slovenia set different indicators of the distribution, size and condition of habitats and species, such as coral rocks, Cymodocea nodosa and Posidonia oceanica meadows, invertebrates of soft seabed and macroalgae. Anchoring restrictions and improved mapping of the seabed will help to reduce the general impacts on these habitats and to develop more effective measures. However, the lack of clear links in the PoM to specific habitats and species makes it difficult to assess if these specific elements are considered in the PoM, and whether or not this might jeopardise achievement of the targets. In addition, no measure specifically addresses target 6.4. Targets are, therefore, only partially covered.
";"Water column habitats: GES and targets are partially addressed by general measures on nutrient input and contaminants, as well as by the links provided to D5 measures. However, NIS introductions are not addressed by the measures reported as relevant for D1, 4 – Water column habitats, which may jeopardise species distribution (and therefore not cover all elements of the GES definition). Targets are addressed.

Seabed habitats: GES is addressed, while targets are partially addressed. The measures address all relevant pressures, providing a framework for the achievement of GES that has a general definition.

SI ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Similar to birds, Slovenia defined GES for fish and cephalopods in a general manner, setting species, habitats and ecosystems functions and distributions as features to be maintained in accordance with natural conditions and baselines defined in the initial assessment. This definition does not refer to any particular species, nor does it mention fish. Slovenia provides a GES definition for food webs (D4), which suggests that GES is achieved when all elements of food webs are at levels that can provide long-term abundance of species and the preservation of their full reproductive capacity. More specifically, the indicators concern the percentage of large fish (not detailing which species) which must be above a threshold to be defined in 2018, and the maintenance of good condition of key trophic groups and species. Slovenia’s PoM provides spatial protection measures (via Natura 2000 areas) and prevents hydromorphological stress generally for all species and habitats groups. CFP-related measures address reductions in the overall fishing effort, potentially reducing non-commercial species by-catch and including their monitoring in landing data collection. 

While the reported measures will improve the general state of fish and cephalopod populations, non-commercial species are only indirectly addressed via the monitoring of landing data. Therefore, the PoM’s impact on ‘large fish’ populations, which is the sole reference to fish made in the GES definition, if any, is an indirect one by means of the reduction of fishing morality. Thus, the PoM only partially addresses GES.  

Slovenia reports mostly general targets for habitats distribution, size and condition in accordance with the Habitats Directive. The only fish and shellfish species directly mentioned are the Pinna nobilis (target 1.3) and the cunner (target 1.4), whose population densities are used as indicators. However, these species are not directly addressed in the PoM. Slovenia explained that future steps could focus on the effectiveness analysis of the implementation of the measures to assess the need to upgrade the PoM or define new measures for biodiversity (D1, 4, 6) and more specifically on large fish, for achieving GES and targets. However, at present, given the lack of specificity of the PoM, it is not possible to ensure that the reported measures will be sufficient to achieve the targets. Since there are, nevertheless, measures providing spatial protection and potentially reducing by-catch by a lowering of fishing effort, the PoM is considered to partially cover the targets.

Slovenia defined a general GES for biodiversity, aiming to maintain species, habitats and ecosystem functions and distributions, and abundance according to the state of the initial assessment and their natural conditions. While the PoM indirectly address by-catch, the relatively small size of the Slovenian fishing fleet may not deem this critical. The PoM also prevents negative impacts on mammals and reptiles from other activities. GES is therefore expected to be addressed.

Among the 16 targets defined for biodiversity, one (target 1.3) specifically concerns the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), with the aim of ‘the achievement of favourable status of the populations and the prevention of deterioration due to human activity regarding the distribution, number and demographic characteristics’. Measure D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU7 also specifically mentions these species. The main pressures for these animals (by-catch to some extent, which, given the small fleet, could only have a small impact) appear to be covered by the PoM. Another target (1.5) focuses on the establishment of protected areas in Slovenian waters and the Adriatic by 2020, which is covered by the spatial protection measures, including both the management of existing MPAs (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU1 and D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU6) and the identification of potential future ones (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU7).

Overall, the PoM addresses GES and targets, as the main impacts on mammals and reptiles are addressed. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Fish and cephalopods: GES and targets are partially addressed through the PoM. Measures reported by Slovenia relate mainly to commercial species. Non-commercial species are only addressed through by-catch landing data. It is not clear whether or not Pinna nobilis and cunner, the only species specifically referred to in the targets, are covered in the measures, which relate solely to spatial protection and commercial fishing restrictions. They are therefore not sufficient to ensure achievement of the targets.

Mammals and reptiles: GES and targets are addressed, as the PoM covers the main impacts on the population of reptiles and mammals (while it cannot be ensured that by-catch is fully addressed, the relatively small Slovenian fishing fleet may only have a small impact on these animals). Targets specifically refer to the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), both of which are directly addressed by several measures.

Slovenia reports that in order to achieve and maintain GES by 2020 for biodiversity (D1, 4, 6), it is necessary to upgrade the existing measures (i.e. 1a). Slovenia reports both existing but not yet implemented measures (i.e. 1b) and new (i.e. 2a) measures for biodiversity (D1, 4, 6). Therefore, GES is expected to be achieved by 2020.

Timeline for implementation of the PoM
Implementation timelines for existing but not implemented measures are, depending on the measure, 2018-2021 (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU7), 2019–2021 (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU8), and 2017–2021 (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU9).

";Slovenia reports that GES is expected to be achieved by 2020. No new measures have been reported for birds, fish and cephalopods and water column habitats. The timelines are therefore appropriate for these species and habitats. One new measure has been reported for seabed habitats and was in place in 2017, with a slight delay (all other measures are already in place). The timelines are therefore also appropriate.

SI ;MED ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Slovenia did not identify any relevant pressure on water columns within its biodiversity measures. Some of the horizontal measures and some of the measures reported for the general biodiversity groups will reduce nutrient enrichment and pollution in water column habitats, although no specific activities are covered by them.

In addition, Slovenia clarified that pressures on water column habitats are addressed by measures reported under eutrophication (D5). While this link is considered reasonable, the PoM still does not specify how these measures will affect water column habitats., 

As such, the pressures on this group are only partially addressed.

In its Article 8 reporting, Slovenia identified physical loss and damage from land claim, coastal defence, port operations and tourism/recreational activities, as well as physical damage from fisheries (including recreational fishing) and shipping as relevant pressures for seabed integrity. 
Impacts from fisheries and recreational fishing are addressed by spatial protection measures, general reduction of fishing effort through the CFP (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU2) and the development of regulations on recreational fishing (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU5). Tourism, including yachting, and shipping are addressed by restrictions in anchoring, navigation and the management of mooring spots. Land claim, coastal defence and port operations are addressed via MSP measures (D1-D11: TU6), EIA (D1-D11: TU1) and ICZM measures (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU4). Overall, the PoM addresses the pressures on seabed habitats.

At the subregional level, physical loss and damage were identified as relevant pressures in their marine environments by Greece, Italy and Croatia. Most of the activities identified by Slovenia are also reported by a majority of the neighbouring Member States (land claim/coastal defence and port operations for physical loss, fisheries for physical damage). In addition, submarine cable and pipeline operations were identified by all of the other neighbouring Member States as causing physical loss. Slovenia did not include this in its Article 8 reporting, but it may be less relevant here, given its short coastline. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives concerns seafloor integrity: ‘Sea‐floor integrity is maintained, especially in priority benthic habitats’ (with associated operational objectives and indicators). The Plan Bleu Regional Activity Centre (one of the six UNEP/MAP’s Regional Advisory Committees, RACs) explains that, despite efforts, the Mediterranean Sea still faces several pressures, among which are the fishing methods destroying or disturbing the seafloor. Slovenia covers fishing impacts on seabed habitats in MPAs through its PoM and aims to reduce fishing effort generally, thus potentially improving the state of seabed habitats in Slovenian territorial waters as a whole. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: Pressures for water column habitats are partially addressed. While some of the main pressures are addressed through biodiversity as well as D5 measures, the general lack of information in the PoM on water column habitats cannot guarantee that all relevant pressures are addressed. 

Seabed habitats: The pressures identified by Slovenia in its Article 8 reporting are addressed. The measures cover physical loss and damage from land claim, coastal defence, port operations, fisheries, tourism and recreation, and shipping.

SI ;MED ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Slovenia defined a general GES for biodiversity, aiming to maintain species, habitats, key trophic groups and ecosystems’ functions and distributions, and abundance according to the state of the initial assessment and their natural conditions. Measures reported by Slovenia can reduce some threats to the achievement of GES. However, there are still elements, such as NIS, which could jeopardise species distribution yet are not considered within the measures relating to water column habitats. Also, the level of detail provided for those measures does not allow for certainty that all elements of the GES definition are covered. Therefore, GES is partially addressed.

Among the 16 targets defined for biodiversity, one (target 4.1) specifically mentions water column habitats and mesozooplankton and concerns the maintenance of ‘the biomass of mesozooplankton below a threshold’, which is not detailed. The new measure on strengthening research efforts to increase knowledge of marine habitats (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU8) may indirectly help to improve the setting of thresholds. Some of the horizontal measures can reduce the volumes of nutrients and pollutants discharged in the sea, reducing the occurrence of blooms. The target is therefore considered to be addressed.

Overall, the PoM partially covers GES and targets for water column habitats. 

Slovenia defined a general GES for seabed habitats and will consider it achieved when the integrity of the seabed is at a level that ensures the protection of the natural structure, scope, distribution and functions of the ecosystem, and where there are no long-term adverse effects on the benthic community. Existing spatial protection measures (Natura 2000) and measures aimed at reducing fishing pressure, as well as the new measure restricting anchoring and navigation, which also aim to improve the mapping of marine habitats, provide a general protection framework, addressing the main potential threats to seabed integrity and establishing the appropriate framework for the achievement of GES.

Slovenia defined five targets for seabed habitats in its PoM. Targets 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 aim to prevent deterioration of the status related to the biomass/abundance/range of the biogenic substrate, the extent of seabed (different types of substrates) that is highly influenced by human activities, and benthic communities, respectively. Target 6.4 focuses on identifying the distribution, cover and biomass of biogenic substrates, while target 6.5 specifically addresses the impact of physical damage on biogenic substrate due to fishing. Under the targets defined for D1, Slovenia set different indicators of the distribution, size and condition of habitats and species, such as coral rocks, Cymodocea nodosa and Posidonia oceanica meadows, invertebrates of soft seabed and macroalgae. Anchoring restrictions and improved mapping of the seabed will help to reduce the general impacts on these habitats and to develop more effective measures. However, the lack of clear links in the PoM to specific habitats and species makes it difficult to assess if these specific elements are considered in the PoM, and whether or not this might jeopardise achievement of the targets. In addition, no measure specifically addresses target 6.4. Targets are, therefore, only partially covered.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Water column habitats: GES and targets are partially addressed by general measures on nutrient input and contaminants, as well as by the links provided to D5 measures. However, NIS introductions are not addressed by the measures reported as relevant for D1, 4 – Water column habitats, which may jeopardise species distribution (and therefore not cover all elements of the GES definition). Targets are addressed.

Seabed habitats: GES is addressed, while targets are partially addressed. The measures address all relevant pressures, providing a framework for the achievement of GES that has a general definition.

UK ;ATL ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"In the initial assessment, the UK reports that changes in plankton communities are affected by climatic conditions, as well as human activity-related pressures such as fishing and nutrient enrichment. However, in the PoM the Member State reports that phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in its waters are considered healthy and that no significant pressures exist. Therefore, it is likely that the reported commercial fish and shellfish (D3) and eutrophication (D5) measures will contribute to the maintenance of these healthy communities. Nutrient enrichment measures (related to D5) and MSY measures (related to D3) have direct effects on plankton communities. However, based on the reported information it is not clear if these measures will be sufficient to address the relevant pressures on water column habitats. The UK does not make a link between measures under these descriptors and water column habitat pressures. 

As reported by the UK, the main pressures on the benthic environment are physical disturbance and loss and the removal of species, which results mainly from demersal fishing activities, which also causes seabed abrasion and damage. Furthermore, the UK reported that land claim activities cause physical loss in both its subregions in the NEA. Finally, nutrient enrichment and pollution are also identified as pressures for seabed habitats in intertidal and shallow marine waters. 

Under Article 8 the UK reports a large number of activities to be responsible for causing physical damage in loss, such as fisheries, marine-based renewable energy, marine hydrocarbon extraction, marine mining, aquaculture and shipping. Furthermore, they reported that physical damage is caused by dredging and tourism /recreation. Physical loss is also addressed by land claim, coastal defence, port operations and solid waste disposal. From all these activities, the UK directly addresses fisheries activities through its PoM. All other activities are likely to be addressed by more generic measures, which include MPA measures but also the implementation of EIAs, MSP and coastal plans. Nutrient enrichment and pollution are not addressed by biodiversity measures, but are covered by measures reported under D5 and D8. Nevertheless, the reported measures are mostly spatial closures and it is very difficult to determine the scale of protection which will be achieved compared with the scale of the pressures on the seafloor. Therefore, pressures are partially covered. 

At the subregional level, most other Member States reported the activities marine renewable energy and land claim and coastal defence, and solid waste disposal to cause physical loss and fisheries and marine mining activities to cause physical damage. Shipping is also reported to be relevant for causing physical damage by half of the Member States in the North Sea. A large number of these activities are not specifically addressed by measures in the UK PoM. 

As the regional level, the reported measures make links with the OSPAR Biodiversity Committee and the list of OSPAR species and habitats. 
";"Water column habitats: In all subregions, the UK reports that plankton communities are in good condition and that no significant pressures impact water column habitats. In addition, the Member State reports commercial fish and shellfish (D3) and eutrophication (D5) measures as relevant for this habitat, to address possible impacts from species extraction and nutrient enrichment. Nutrient enrichment measures (related to D5) and MSY measures (related to D3) have indirect effects on plankton communities. Apart from these, it is not clear how pressures might be addressed by the reported measures. It is also likely that measures reported for NIS (D2), hydrographical changes (D7) and contaminants (D8) also contribute at addressing GES and targets for these habitat types, yet the UK does not elaborate on this. As such, overall, measures are likely to at least partially address relevant pressures on water column habitats. 

Seabed habitats: The reported groups of measures partially address pressures identified by the Member State for seabed habitats in the NEA. Pressures caused by demersal fishing, bottom gear fishing and land claim and coastal defence are addressed. Nevertheless, it is not clear to what extent other reported activities such as marine renewable energies, hydrocarbon extraction dredging, mining etc. are covered by the PoM. 
In Gibraltar, the measures partially address pressures on seabed habitats, given that even though spatial protection measures have been reported, pressures from transport, tourism and recreation, anchoring and maintenance dredging do not seem to have been addressed.

Nutrient enrichment measures (related to D5) and MSY measures (related to D3) have indirect effects on plankton communities. Apart from these, it is not clear how pressures might be addressed by the reported measures. As such, overall, measures partially address water column GES and targets. 

The existing and existing but not yet implemented measures covering seabed habitats (including rock and biogenic reef habitats, and sediment habitats) will partially address the UK’s seabed habitat targets (targets 25 to 37 described in Annex 2 of this document) and GES definition on seabed integrity. Combined they address coastal development, marine licensing and planning of project, shoreline management plans, river basin management plans (WFD), MPAs (including SSSIs), and inshore fisheries bylaws. They combine licencing measures (EIA Directive), conservation measures (MPAs) and management measures (WFD). Offshore fisheries will be covered by the CFP, whereas renewable energy will be addressed by measures under the MSP Directive. Nevertheless, a large number of activities identified under Article 8 are not specifically covered by the measures and it is therefore not clear whether the measures will cover all elements of the GES and targets definitions (e.g. impacts of human activities on seabed habitats). Together, these measures will partially contribute towards achieving seabed integrity, as defined by the GES and target definitions.";"Water column habitats: The measures partially address the water column habitat targets in all subregions. The UK states that communities in this habitat are healthy and that no pressures significantly reduce the likelihood of GES and target achievement.

Key anthropogenic pressures, as identified by the UK in their initial assessment, include the extraction of fish species by commercial fishing through both direct removal of target fish, and indirectly by removing non-target fish that are predators, prey or competitors and physically impacting essential habitats. The reported measures cover commercial and non-commercial fishing activities, as well as threatened and vulnerable (groups of) species (e.g. sharks, skates and rays, deep-sea species and diadromous fish species such as the European eel and salmon), thus addressing the main elements and pressures.

Based on the reported information existing and existing but not yet implemented measures, covering commercial fish, elasmobranches and diadromous fish, are likely to address the direct impact of human activities on fish and the overall health of fish communities, by targeting the abundance and distribution of fish species (including sensitive species), their distributional patterns and their biomass, in line with UK’s MSFD targets (targets 16 to 19 as described in Annex 2 of this document), which is also in line with the Member State’s GES definition. While a large part of the reported measures relates to the CFP and concerns commercial fisheries, some of the reported measures tackle fish biodiversity targets through the established MPAs (which are also planned to be geographically extended in the future). Some groups of measures target other non-commercial species (e.g. sharks). While the targets specify ‘sensitive fish’ species in general, the measures actually focus on specific species, which is considered more operational. As in the case of birds, a key assumption made is that these existing measures are able to address the UK targets, an aspect that cannot be verified based on the information reported by the UK.

UK ;ATL ;13;D6;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
In the initial assessment, the UK reports that changes in plankton communities are affected by climatic conditions, as well as human activity-related pressures such as fishing and nutrient enrichment. However, in the PoM the Member State reports that phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in its waters are considered healthy and that no significant pressures exist. Therefore, it is likely that the reported commercial fish and shellfish (D3) and eutrophication (D5) measures will contribute to the maintenance of these healthy communities. Nutrient enrichment measures (related to D5) and MSY measures (related to D3) have direct effects on plankton communities. However, based on the reported information it is not clear if these measures will be sufficient to address the relevant pressures on water column habitats. The UK does not make a link between measures under these descriptors and water column habitat pressures. 

As reported by the UK, the main pressures on the benthic environment are physical disturbance and loss and the removal of species, which results mainly from demersal fishing activities, which also causes seabed abrasion and damage. Furthermore, the UK reported that land claim activities cause physical loss in both its subregions in the NEA. Finally, nutrient enrichment and pollution are also identified as pressures for seabed habitats in intertidal and shallow marine waters. 

Under Article 8 the UK reports a large number of activities to be responsible for causing physical damage in loss, such as fisheries, marine-based renewable energy, marine hydrocarbon extraction, marine mining, aquaculture and shipping. Furthermore, they reported that physical damage is caused by dredging and tourism /recreation. Physical loss is also addressed by land claim, coastal defence, port operations and solid waste disposal. From all these activities, the UK directly addresses fisheries activities through its PoM. All other activities are likely to be addressed by more generic measures, which include MPA measures but also the implementation of EIAs, MSP and coastal plans. Nutrient enrichment and pollution are not addressed by biodiversity measures, but are covered by measures reported under D5 and D8. Nevertheless, the reported measures are mostly spatial closures and it is very difficult to determine the scale of protection which will be achieved compared with the scale of the pressures on the seafloor. Therefore, pressures are partially covered.

Pressures caused by demersal fishing, bottom gear fishing and land claim and coastal defence are addressed. Nevertheless, it is not clear to what extent other reported activities such as marine renewable energies, hydrocarbon extraction dredging, mining etc. are covered by the PoM. 
In Gibraltar, the measures partially address pressures on seabed habitats, given that even though spatial protection measures have been reported, pressures from transport, tourism and recreation, anchoring and maintenance dredging do not seem to have been addressed.

UK ;ATL ;13;D6;Coverage of GES and targets;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Based on the reported information, existing measures reported under commercial fish and shellfish (D3) and eutrophication (D5) will contribute to addressing water column habitats, and namely the UK MSFD general biodiversity GES and habitat specific targets (targets 20 to 24 as described in Annex 2 of this document). Nutrient enrichment measures (related to D5) and MSY measures (related to D3) have indirect effects on plankton communities. Apart from these, it is not clear how pressures might be addressed by the reported measures. As such, overall, measures partially address water column GES and targets. 

The existing and existing but not yet implemented measures covering seabed habitats (including rock and biogenic reef habitats, and sediment habitats) will partially address the UK’s seabed habitat targets (targets 25 to 37 described in Annex 2 of this document) and GES definition on seabed integrity. Combined they address coastal development, marine licensing and planning of project, shoreline management plans, river basin management plans (WFD), MPAs (including SSSIs), and inshore fisheries bylaws. They combine licencing measures (EIA Directive), conservation measures (MPAs) and management measures (WFD). Offshore fisheries will be covered by the CFP, whereas renewable energy will be addressed by measures under the MSP Directive. Nevertheless, a large number of activities identified under Article 8 are not specifically covered by the measures and it is therefore not clear whether the measures will cover all elements of the GES and targets definitions (e.g. impacts of human activities on seabed habitats). Together, these measures will partially contribute towards achieving seabed integrity, as defined by the GES and target definitions.";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
o	Water column habitats: The measures partially address the water column habitat targets in all subregions. The UK states that communities in this habitat are healthy and that no pressures significantly reduce the likelihood of GES and target achievement. The measures focus on reducing nutrient levels and fisheries impacts. It is also likely that measures reported for NIS (D2), hydrographical changes (D7) and contaminants (D8) also contribute at addressing GES and targets for these habitat types, yet the UK does not elaborate on this. As such, the measures are likely to at least partially address the GES and targets.

The seabird targets focus on bird distribution and abundance, and preventing these to be affected by human activities, in addition to ensuring a continued recruitment from donor populations in the area. Furthermore, Gibraltar aims to ensure adequate fish stocks in its marine waters. Finally, the targets aim to reduce by-catch impacts on bird breeding populations and to reduce the risk of oil spills. Even though the Member State does not report a great detail of information on the actual activities under its measures, the targets may be considered broadly addressed, given the reported links of its measures with existing EU legal acts and national regulations.

UK ;MED ;13;D1 Pelagic ;Coverage of pressures;"In its PoM, the UK specifies that even though there are changes in the composition and spatial and temporal abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton in Gibraltar waters, plankton communities as a whole are considered to be healthy and that significant human pressures do not exist. However, the Member State reports measures under commercial fish and shellfish (D3) and eutrophication (D5) as relevant for these habitats. It is also likely that measures reported for NIS (D2), hydrographical changes (D7) and contaminants (D8) will also at least partially contribute addressing pressures for water column habitats, although this link is not explicitly reported on by the Member State and the details are not known. Overall, pressures are likely to be at least partially addressed.

Under Article 8, the UK reported that the activities maritime transport, tourism and recreation, anchoring and maintenance dredging cause physical damage in Gibraltar’s waters. Furthermore, the Member State reported that coastal defence causes physical loss. In its measures for seabed habitats, the UK refers to activities under several existing national and EU legal acts which will overall reduce pressures on seabed habitats. However, due to the limited amount of reported information it is not clear whether the measures will be sufficient to address physical disturbances caused by human activities. In particular, illegal fishing activities seem to be an issue and the UK only reports to consider measures addressing this activity but does not present actual measures that do so. Therefore, the measures partially address the pressures.

At the subregional level, all neighboring Member States report land claim, coastal defence, port operations and submarine cable and pipeline laying as relevant activities causing physical loss. Furthermore, they all report fisheries to cause physical damage. Two out of three neighboring Member State report marine mining, dredging, land claim, coastal defence, port operations and tourism and recreation to cause physical damage in the Western Mediterranean. It is not clear if all of these activities are relevant for Gibraltar, for example submarine cables, pipelines, and land claim and coastal defense activities are likely to be not relevant for Gibraltar. However, Gibraltar has an important port and, therefore, port activities are likely to be relevant, in addition to dredging and tourism activities. New projects related to these activities can be covered by measures foreseeing EIA before conducting projects impacting the marine environment. Physical damage caused by fisheries does not seem to have been addressed by these measures. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives is that: “Sea‐floor integrity is maintained, especially in priority benthic habitats”  (associated with operational objectives and indicators). The Plan Bleu Regional Activity Centre (one of the six UNEP/MAP’s RACs) explains that, despite regional efforts, the Mediterranean Sea is still facing several pressures. One of them concerns the fishing methods that destroy or disturb the seafloor . Therefore, at least the fisheries have a role in physical loss and damage in the Western Mediterranean Sea. As explained above, it is not clear how the pressures from fisheries are addressed in this subregion through the reported measures. ";"Water column habitats: In all subregions, the UK reports that plankton communities are in good condition and that no significant pressures impact water column habitats. In addition, the Member State reports commercial fish and shellfish (D3) and eutrophication (D5) measures as relevant for this habitat, to address possible impacts from species extraction and nutrient enrichment. Nutrient enrichment measures (related to D5) and MSY measures (related to D3) have indirect effects on plankton communities. Apart from these, it is not clear how pressures might be addressed by the reported measures. It is also likely that measures reported for NIS (D2), hydrographical changes (D7) and contaminants (D8) also contribute at addressing GES and targets for these habitat types, yet the UK does not elaborate on this. As such, overall, measures are likely to at least partially address relevant pressures on water column habitats. 

Seabed habitats: The reported groups of measures partially address pressures identified by the Member State for seabed habitats in the NEA. Pressures caused by demersal fishing, bottom gear fishing and land claim and coastal defence are addressed. Nevertheless, it is not clear to what extent other reported activities such as marine renewable energies, hydrocarbon extraction dredging, mining etc. are covered by the PoM.

However, as stated above, the Member State considers its plankton communities healthy. As in the case of pressures, it is also likely that measures reported for NIS (D2), hydrographical changes (D7) and contaminants (D8) will also at least partially contribute addressing GES and targets for water column habitats, although this link is not explicitly reported on by the Member State and the details are not known. Overall, GES and targets are likely to be at least partially addressed.

GES for Gibraltar refers specifically to D6 and aims to maintain productive and functional seabed habitats and ecosystems, which are protected from detrimental human impacts. The assessment finds that seabed habitats are covered by several spatial protection measures and measures that foresee that the EIA should reduce possible future impacts on these habitats from human activates. However, various relevant activities causing physical damage and loss do not seem to have been sufficiently covered by the PoM. Therefore, the GES is partially addressed. 

The targets link closely to the definition of GES and aim at preventing the deterioration of designated habitats, to protect seabed habitat functionality, and to reduce detrimental impacts. As for GES, these targets are partially covered by spatial protection and environmental management measures but it remains unclear if the large range of activities impacting seabed habitats in Gibraltar waters is sufficiently addressed to allow for an achievement of target. 
";"Water column habitats: The measures partially address the water column habitat targets in all subregions. The UK states that communities in this habitat are healthy and that no pressures significantly reduce the likelihood of GES and target achievement. The measures focus on reducing nutrient levels and fisheries impacts. It is also likely that measures reported for NIS (D2), hydrographical changes (D7) and contaminants (D8) also contribute at addressing GES and targets for these habitat types, yet the UK does not elaborate on this. As such, the measures are likely to at least partially address the GES and targets. 

Seabed habitats: They partially address GES and targets in the NEA region by targeting coastal development, marine licensing and planning of projects, shoreline management plans, river basin management plans (WFD), MPAs (including SSSIs), and inshore fisheries bylaws all in line with their target definitions. They combine licencing measures (EIA Directive), conservation measures (MPAs) and management measures (WFD). Nevertheless, a large number of activities identified under Article 8 are not specifically covered by the measures and it is therefore not clear whether the measures will cover all elements of the GES and targets definitions (e.g. impacts of human activities on seabed habitats).

UK ;MED ;13;D4;Coverage of pressures;"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Gibraltar’s reported measures focus mainly on fish habitat protection through MPA designations and management. However, the UK also reports measures under the Marine Protection Regulations (2014) and Tuna Preservation Regulations (2014) that will also include restriction of fishing activities in certain areas. Even though Gibraltar does not have its own fishing fleet, the UK reports that fishing pressures are caused by illegal fishing activities. However, it is not clear if the reported environmental protection measures will be sufficient to reduce these pressures on sensitive fish species. Therefore, the pressures are partially addressed.

The UK reports that marine mammals are protected under a number of EU and national legal acts and refers to international conventions, such as CITES in its mammal measures for Gibraltar. However, the Member State provides little detail in its PoM on the activities that are taking place under the measures. It only specifies that the measures include guidelines on how to proceed when cetaceans are injured. Measures to prevent mammal injuries by collisions with ships or to limit the impact of underwater noise have not been explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the measures partially address pressures for mammals. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment 
Fish (and cephalopods): The reported NEA measures target commercial and non-commercial fishing activities, as well as threatened and vulnerable species (e.g. sharks, skates and rays, deep sea species and diadromous fish species such as the European eel and salmon), thus addressing the main pressures.
In Gibraltar waters pressures on fish are partially addressed because even though spatial protection measures contribute to a reduction of pressures, illegal fishing activities (a problem acknowledged by Gibraltar) are not addressed.

Mammals (and reptiles): The reported groups of measures in the NEA address the main pressures from fisheries by-catch, prey depletion and competition, marine pollution, vessel or propeller strikes and underwater noise. The planned measure on by-catch limits is likely to positively contribute to mitigating pressures from fisheries.
In Gibraltar, measures partially address pressures on mammals, because vessel collisions with ships and underwater noise are not covered by the measures.

Similarly, to what is reported for birds, the GES definition reported for fish in Gibraltar is overarching and covering general biodiversity aspects. It does not specifically mention fish. Nevertheless, as Gibraltar’s measures on fish do not address all the relevant pressures it is unlikely that they will be sufficient to achieve GES. Hence, they are partially addressing GES and targets.

The fish species targets focus on distribution, population size and community composition and ensuring they are not adversely affected by human activities. Even though the designation and management of MPAs is an important step towards the conservation of sensitive fish species, they will partially address fish targets, as illegal fishing activities are not currently addressed. 

For Gibraltar, the UK reports that existing work under the Habitats Directive accounts for all marine mammals, however there is little information provided on the specifics of existing measures. The Member State identifies that further work is required to improve conservation status, therefore these measures require further information to determine whether they consider all aspects of the GES definitions. Furthermore, they state that the measures will contribute to maintaining the status of species already identified as in ‘favourable’ status and to achieving GES for other marine mammals, however, it is stated that targets and indicators will be assessed once the measures are made operational. 

The UK reports that the marine mammal species in its waters are all migratory, and therefore domestic actions can only have a limited effect on their abundance, distribution etc. The targets defined for marine mammals link to distribution, mortality, and productivity. Overall, although some of the GES and targets definitions will be addressed by the reported measures, the information reported has gaps and it is unclear to what extent certain pressures are addressed. As such, the measures partially address the GES and target definitions. ";"From D1, 4, 6 assessment

Mammals (and reptiles): The NEA measures partially address the direct impacts of human activities on mammals. The measures aim to address marine mammals’ condition (e.g. species productivity, abundance and distribution), as well as address impacts from by-catch. Through the measures, the UK also addresses the two species groups identified as part of its targets (i.e. seals and cetaceans). Nevertheless, the UK does not define any baselines (as specified in its targets) which is a gap in the PoM.

Aquaculture, a relevant activity identified by Belgium in its Article 8, is not being addressed by any of the reported measures. 

At the subregional level, neighbouring Member States have identified shipping and aquaculture as key pathways of NIS introductions. Belgium covers shipping, but not aquaculture through its measures. 

At the regional level, the Belgian PoM measures for D2 indirectly address some aspects of OSPAR’s thematic priority of avoiding loss of biological diversity and achieving and maintaining healthy ecosystems. According to OSPAR, the main sources of NIS in the subregion are aquaculture and shipping. Therefore, Belgium partially covers these activities.";The measures address the key pressure identified in their Article 8 reporting. However, they partially address their reported pathways. The role of aquaculture in the introduction of NIS is not mentioned in the PoM (even if aquaculture is one of the three reported activities contributing to D2). Regional priorities under OSPAR are partially addressed as well. ;2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b800d03d-1dbf-40a1-8e68-712ab87453ed/details
BE;ATL;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets;"The Belgian GES definition states that non-indigenous species introduced by human activities are at levels that do not adversely alter the ecosystem; and that no significant increase in the relative abundance of non-indigenous species in relation to the 2012 baseline should occur. By setting up measures addressing two of the three most important pathways, Belgium will partially support achieving GES for D2. The absence of measures about aquaculture associated to the introduction of NIS is a risk in not achieving GES for D2. The measures might also not be fully able to address the impacts of NIS on the marine ecosystem. Furthermore, none of the reported measures directly address the aspect of the Belgian GES definition which states ‘no significant increase in existing NIS in relation to 2012 baselines should occur'; an issue that is very difficult to manage and control anyway. 

Belgium defines one target for D2 (target 18 on the prevention of the introduction of new NIS through human activities compared to the 2012 baseline). The ballast water and ship fouling measures address important pathways of new introduction. The windfarm measures focus on controlling NIS introductions that might be introduced during the construction phase of wind turbines, through a set of management measures that aim to control physical and biological inputs as well as follow-up measures to ensure that any incidences are recorded appropriately. Measures concerning aquaculture are not included, even if this pathway can also introduce the species mentioned in the target. ";"The measures partially address the D2 GES and targets. They are likely to prevent the introduction of non-indigenous species through improved management of high risk pathways and vectors (shipping and marine-based renewable energy production); but not fully able to address the impacts on marine ecosystem and the last reported pathway (aquaculture). The reported measures cover the Belgian targets definition by addressing key pathways and vectors which facilitate the introduction and spread of NIS as a result of human activities. They do not address the GES definition of not significantly increasing the relative abundance of existing NIS.

BE;ATL ;13;D3 ;Coverage of pressures;"Belgium addresses several pressures through its measures. Firstly, it covers the pressure of selective extraction of species including accidental by-catch, which links to the pressure in the context of its Article 8 reporting. The activities causing this pressure are, on the one hand, commercial fisheries, which are addressed by several measures (measures 8A-J, 10, 32). On the other hand, this pressure is also exacerbated by recreational fisheries, which are also addressed by a number of specific measures (measure 27A, C). 

Belgium also puts in place a measure targeting the transition of recreational fishers into the professional sector (more fish are subjected to quality controls and increase in the quality of fish consumed, which will limit pollution generated by dangerous substances) (measure 27C) . It also addresses physical loss, physical damage and the abrasion of seabed habitats caused by destructive fishing methods through its D3 measures (measure 8A-J).

For its Article 8 reporting in 2012, Belgium reported aquaculture as an activity causing the pressure extraction of species, fish and shellfish. However, its PoM contains no measures related to aquaculture activities. 
 
At the subregional level in the North Sea, all neighbouring Member States have identified fisheries, including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish) as a key activity causing the pressure extraction of species (fish and shellfish). Belgium addresses these subregional pressures through its measures. 

At regional level, OSPAR does not identify pressures related to commercial fishing (other than indirectly, through its impacts on biological diversity and healthy ecosystems), as fisheries is beyond the remit of its work. This prevents comparisons with regional pressures and priorities in the context of this descriptor. ";The measures address the key pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting, i.e. extraction of species, fish and shellfish. However, Belgium does not address the key activity aquaculture, which it reported for Article 8 as relevant for this pressure. Belgium also covers the pressures of physical damage, physical loss and biological disturbances (and thus contributing to D1, 4, 6). ;1;Not addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b800d03d-1dbf-40a1-8e68-712ab87453ed/details
BE;ATL ;13;D3 ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Belgium’s GES definition addresses fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass, with both aspects addressed by the existing and new measures of the PoM. Existing measures 8 and 10 address fishing mortality (F) and biomass for CFP TAC stocks and non-TAC stocks in territorial waters. The new and completely new measures 23 and 27A-C support the achievement of sustainable levels of fishing mortality and biomass, through better coordination of federal and regional government in addressing recreational fishing, which has an almost commercial nature in Belgium, with ‘recreational’ trawl vessels. 

Belgium has also designed a specific approach for sharks and rays through its new measure 32. It highlights the threatened and endangered status of many of these species that results in zero or very low TAC, which may cause ‘choke’  problems under the landings obligation. Even though Belgium aims to improve the identification of these species (by fishermen, sellers and consumers) under the measure, it reports no plan to improve data collection on these species. This would contribute to improving stock assessments and management for these individual species.

Several of Belgium’s D3 targets overlap with each other. Target 20, for example, refers to safe biological limits in relation to exploitation level, age/size distribution and full reproductive capacity, which overlaps with target 19 related to Fmsy, target 22 related to Bmsy, target 23 related to Fpa and Bpa and target 24 related to fishing mortality (F). These targets are addressed by measure 8, linked to the CFP and its associated data collection and enforcement activities, in addition to the new measures 23A, 27 and 32, which cover better policy coordination, management of recreational fishing activities, and species-specific fisheries management for sharks and rays. 

With respect to shellfish fisheries, measure 10 addresses the targets for shellfish. The measure relates to a prohibition of shellfish harvesting within 12nm, but it does not specify how shellfish are managed beyond 12nm, leaving it unclear if the measure sufficiently addresses targets 20, 21 and 22 for shellfish. 

Belgium does not identify any measures as addressing target 25 on data-deficient stocks. The target requires the initiation of discussions on alternative evaluation methods for such stocks, however no actions are identified to take this forward. These actions might take place through EU coordination with ICES, but this is not reported by Belgium (although it may form part of existing measure 8F). The improvement of data collection and scientific knowledge on these data-deficient stocks would also be a valuable way to address the target, as it would address this data deficiency, therefore measure 32 to improve species-specific data on sharks and rays, may contribute to this.";The measures address the D3 GES and targets, as they target fishing mortality (F), age/size distribution, reproductive capacity, and biomass for CFP stocks and shellfish stocks. Belgium also addresses the parameters by increasing the regulations and controls of recreational fishing activities in Belgian waters.

BE;ATL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"Belgium reports that the main sources of nutrients leading to eutrophication problems in Belgian seas originate from river inputs from agriculture, forestry and industry. The reported measures partially address the pressures and activities reported under Article 8 for D5, as they do not appear to tackle agriculture or forestry pollution. For instance, no mention is made of implementing the Nitrates Directive. 

Industrial nutrient pollution will most likely be tackled through either the UWWTD or Waste Framework Directives, expressly referred to in measure 15, although no mention is made of the Industrial Emissions Directive. On the other hand, the reported measures predominantly tackle urban municipal sources of nutrients through the UWWTD, the WFD and the Waste Framework Directives, even though urban pollution is not reported as a source of nutrients. The policy plan of the Flemish region aims to limit the waste input to the marine environment, although the origin of this waste is not specified. Furthermore, the adequacy of the WFD measures, as reported in 2016 RBMPs, to tackle eutrophication are pending the results of the WFD assessments. 

At the sub-regional level, nutrient enrichment is identified as a pressure by most neighbouring Member States. Industrial, agricultural and urban activities are reported as relevant. These are addressed by the Belgian measures, even though urban areas are not acknowledged as a relevant source of nutrients.

At regional level, OSPAR does not identify specific pressures related to eutrophication but, rather, refers mainly to its impacts. A comparison with regional pressures and priorities is, therefore, impossible. ";The measures partially address pressures and activities identified in their Article 8 reporting – most measures tackle the input of nutrients from urban sources, but they do not tackle agriculture, nor do they tackle industry. ;2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b800d03d-1dbf-40a1-8e68-712ab87453ed/details
BE;ATL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets;"In accordance with the Belgian definition, GES for D5 is achieved when the criteria for WFD Good Ecological Status and the criteria from the OSPAR Common Procedure are achieved, and when human-induced eutrophication is minimised, in particular its negative effects. The programme of measures as reported does not appear to tackle agriculture, nor does it sufficiently tackle industry, the two major activities contributing to nutrient pollution, making it very unlikely that human-induced eutrophication will be minimised. No statement is made on if WFD Good Ecological Status or the OSPAR Common Procedure criteria have been achieved, although measure 17 deals with monitoring and evaluation/assessment of marine environmental quality within the scope of the national obligations associated with the ‘Joint Assessment and Monitoring Programme’ (JAMP) of the OSPAR Commission and the WFD. The latter is not a measure which will have any direct impacts on achieving GES and targets, but rather indirectly contribute to understanding the state of the marine environment better. 

Belgium defined three environmental targets for Descriptor 5, all of which are concerned with either nutrient levels in the sea or direct impacts of nutrient enrichment. All existing and new measures are concerned with reducing land-derived nutrient loads to the sea, thereby reducing concentrations in the sea itself and the associated impacts. ";The measures partially address the D5 GES and targets as they aim to reduce land-derived nutrient load to the sea, thereby reducing concentrations in the sea itself and the associated impacts.

BE;ATL ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"Belgium reports shipping as an activity contributing to the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. Based on the expert assessment report and the PoM, however, other activities have been identified that have an impact on this pressure (e.g. fishing, recreational shipping, port operations, marine renewable energy) and these activities have been included in the table above.

Belgium reports that the introduction of (non-) synthetic compounds is a relevant pressure in the Belgian part of the North Sea and is mainly due to shipping. Several measures have been defined to address the impact of shipping which is identified as a source of pollution (for example measures 12 and 19 on restricting movement and waste discharge respectively). Several measures also target other sources, such as fisheries, marine-based renewable energy generation, land-based, dredging and port operations. In the case of acute pollution events, Belgium reports this pressure as occurring in the Belgian part of the North Sea and the concerned activities are shipping and marine-based renewable energy generation. Several measures apply to these elements, such as measures 3D (oil spills) and 19 (shipping waste). Therefore, the Belgian PoM addresses the reported pressures.At the subregional level, Member States have identified other activities as sources of contaminants. Most neighbouring Member States report industry, agriculture, urban and shipping as the main sources of hazardous compounds and shipping as responsible for accidental pollution. Therefore, the PoM addresses these activities (industrial, urban and agricultural activities could potentially be addressed within the two land-based measures, 15 and 23B). Shipping is addresses as well through the reported PoM, as explained above. However, atmospheric deposition is not listed as a relevant pressure despite being a potentially important source of contaminants. This may be because emissions can be traced back to one or more of the activities listed above. If Belgium considers only the national contribution to these activities and pressures, it would do so at the expense of the transboundary aspect of emissions from these sources.
At the regional level, the Belgian PoM is in line with OSPAR’s objective of ‘preventing pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions, and losses of hazardous substances, with the aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances’. Indeed, the measures focus on both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. They also target several human activities and topics that are contributing to the release of these compounds in the North Sea (hydrocarbon, shipping security, shipping in the wind farms areas, anti-fouling products, prevention of diverse types of pollution in the sea, shipping waste, bunkering and yachting related pollution in harbours, lead lost at sea, dumping of dredged materials, land-based measures, marine environment quality). ";The measures address all key pressures and activities identified in Belgium's Article 8 reporting and additionally address activities such as fisheries, marine-based renewable energy generation or port operations. The PoM draws upon international, EU and regional pieces of legislation including (but not limited to) the WFD, OSPAR and MARPOL. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b800d03d-1dbf-40a1-8e68-712ab87453ed/details

It can be noted that no targets are defined for river discharge or atmospheric deposition (contrary to neighbouring countries, such as Germany). While it can be assumed that river discharge is covered under the WFD and the OSPAR Riverine Inputs and Direct Discharges (RID) programme; the RID programme should nevertheless be highlighted by Belgium in the PoM. Atmospheric deposition can be a significant source of hazardous substances but there is no mention of a target for this source of the pressure

BE;ATL ;13;D9;Coverage of pressures ;The reported measures do not address the pressures reported by Belgium in Article 8 for D9 which was: contamination by hazardous substances (including accidental pollution). In terms of activities, Belgium reported in its Article 8 assessment that the main activities responsible for contamination by hazardous substances are shipping and marine-based renewable energy generation. The measures proposed by Belgium for D9 have an indirect impact on the pressure (except one direct measure) and focus on fisheries. The reported measures for D9 have monitoring and governance purposes and the direct measure focuses on recreational fishing, which is not enough to directly contribute to reduce the pressure. Therefore, the pressure mentioned in Article 8 is not covered by the D9 measures. Nevertheless, D8 measures do address this pressure and associated activities (as well as others such as, for example, port operations) and as such the combined D9 and D8 measures could be considered as partially addressing the relevant D9 pressures. ;"The measures do not address the key pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting. Indeed, most of the measures have indirect effects on the D9-related pressure because they are either monitoring or governance measures, that focus on fisheries, except one direct measure that targets recreational fishing; yet the D8 measures do tackle the pressure associated with the introduction of hazardous compounds and several activities, including shipping and marine-based renewable energy generation (reported in Article 8) and others relevant to D9.

BE;ATL ;13;D9;Coverage of GES and targets;"In combination with the measures reported for D8, the measures set up by Belgium address the D9 GES definition, which is very broad and just states that contaminants should not exceed levels established by Community legislation.

The measures defined by Belgium for D9 are either focused on monitoring or aim to increase dialogue between stakeholders. It is therefore not possible to assess whether these measures enable to limit the concentration of contaminants in fish and shellfish for human consumption.Belgium has also provided information on how targets will be reached by the new measures: although a quantitative contribution towards meeting the targets is not possible, a qualitative effectiveness score is provided for each new measure by the Member State.

BE;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"Belgium reports fisheries, shipping and tourism as sources contributing to the pressure marine litter. The existing and new measures address this pressure and activities. Measures with a direct impact on D10 and focusing on fisheries have been defined and one measure focuses on land-based activities (it is quite likely that tourism is part of these activities). Another measure has an indirect effect on marine litter and targets tourism. Moreover, other measures cover diverse activities, such as port operations, shipping and land-based activities. The D10 measures also include efforts on monitoring of micro-plastics (and raising awareness about it). Monitoring efforts would better suit to be reported as part of the MSFD monitoring programmes (Article 11), rather than the PoM. 

At the sub-regional level, neighbouring Member States have identified fisheries, tourism and shipping as key activities contributing to marine litter. Taking the example of immediate neighbours, the Netherlands have identified shipping and fisheries, but not tourism, as sources of marine litter. France, by contrast, does not report any activity as contributing to marine litter in the North Sea, despite evidence showing the recognition of shipping and tourism as marine litter sources (in French marine waters). Belgium covers these pressures/activities through its measures. 

At the regional level, the Belgian PoM addresses OSPAR’s objective of substantially reducing ‘marine litter in the OSPAR maritime area to levels where properties and quantities do not cause harm to the marine environment’. As such, the measures focus both on sea-based and land-based sources of litter, develop removal actions, and include educational and outreach elements. Through the recognition of shipping, fisheries, land-based activities and port operations as activities contributing to the issue of marine litter, Belgium goes beyond its neighbour countries. ";The measures address the relevant pressure and activities identified by Belgium in their Article 8 reporting. The measures address human activities such as fisheries, shipping, port operations or land-based activities. They may cover tourism (reported in Article 8) through a measure that focuses on diverse land-based activities and another measure that has an indirect impact on the pressure (its aim is to raise awareness).

BE;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of Ges and targets ;"Belgium provides a general, non-quantitative definition of GES for D10, i.e. the properties and quantities of marine litter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment. This means that:
•	The amount of litter (and its degradation products) does not cause harm/damage (direct or indirect) to marine life and habitats.
•	The amount of litter (including its degradation products) on coastlines and in the marine environment is decreasing over time and is at a level which does not result in harmful effects to the coastal or marine environment.

The measures broadly address the GES definition. Almost all existing and new measures relate to macro-litter (M15, 16, 19, 21, 22, 28B and 29), being operational measures that directly and indirectly (as explained above) contribute to the reduction of litter on the coastline (M15, M16) and in the marine environment (M19, 22, 28B, 29). Although no direct removal of micro-litter is envisaged by the proposed measures, it may be assumed that any reduction of macro-litter will indirectly lead to some reduction of micro-litter in the environment. Measure 21 (monitoring programme associated with OSPAR obligations) relates to both the macro- and micro-litter (or the degradation products) for the seabird Northern Fulmars, making it possible to assess whether there is a decrease in quantity over time. However, this is a monitoring effort rather than a measure addressing pressures on the marine environment. Measure 15 also targets micro-litter, but through raising awareness about this pressure.

Two of the four targets (45 and 47) are partly overlapping and their definition is not clear enough. The four targets have been formulated as trends and lack threshold values, making it difficult to assess against the measures. It can be stated, therefore, that given the link between all measures and all targets, they will contribute to the targets of decreasing trends in the amount of litter in the marine environment (a clear link is provided for the new measures, which is not the case for the existing measures; still, all measures can be either linked directly or indirectly to the four targets, but no information is given on their exact contribution towards meeting the targets). Each one of the four new measures is associated with the four targets. Belgium on its side has also provided information on how targets will be reached by the new measures: although a quantitative contribution towards reaching the targets is not possible, a qualitative effectiveness score is provided for each measure by the Member State. This enables an indication of contribution towards meeting the targets: 28B (low), 29A (very high); 29B (a study is included to assess the effectiveness/feasibility of this measure, but it is presumed to be very high), 29C (very high).";The measures partially address the GES and targets reported by Belgium in 2012. They could potentially deliver reductions in the introduction of macro- and micro-litter. No direct operational measures are proposed to reduce the amount of micro-litter (two measures that have indirect effects on D10 address micro-litter), but this is likely to be targeted indirectly by tackling macro-litter. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b800d03d-1dbf-40a1-8e68-712ab87453ed/details

BE;ATL ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Belgium reports shipping and the production of marine-based renewable energy as sources of underwater noise. The reported measures address one of these activities (marine renewables) and another non-reported one (military activities). However, shipping is covered by a measure that has an indirect impact on the pressure (communication and raising awareness). Therefore, Belgium partially addresses the reported pressures and activities.

At the sub-regional level, Member States have identified marine-based renewable energy, defence operations, marine research and shipping as key activities contributing to underwater noise (they do not report anything related to other forms of energy input). Belgium directly or indirectly covers these activities through its measures, except marine research. 

At the regional level, OSPAR aims to develop methods to assess the impacts of sound on marine species and to address the cumulative effects of different sources. OSPAR acknowledges the existence of many sources of underwater noise. By focusing on a few of these, the Belgian PoM for D11 partly addresses OSPAR’s objective. ";The measures partially address pressures and activities identified in the Article 8 reporting (shipping, marine-based renewable energy). While marine renewables is the focus of a group of existing measures, shipping is addressed by a measure that has an indirect impact on the pressure (communication and awareness raising effort). Moreover, one of the main activities reported as responsible for underwater noise at the subregional level (marine research) is not covered by the D11 PoM.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b800d03d-1dbf-40a1-8e68-712ab87453ed/details
BE;ATL ;13;D11;Coverage of Ges and targets ;"The GES associated with D11 refers to:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  •	Impulse sounds and regional sound budgets do not adversely affect marine organisms.
•	Loud, low and mid-frequency impulse sounds and continuous low-frequency sounds introduced into the marine environment through human activities do not have adverse effects on marine ecosystems

The existing measures 3E and 3F address the first point of the above GES definition for D11. The new measures also aim to address the first point of this definition. Moreover, Belgium puts in place measures against both impulsive (measures 3 and 30 on renewable energy generation (pile driving) and military activities respectively) and continuous noise (measure 31 on shipping). Therefore, the PoM addresses the second point of the above GES definition for D11. Belgian targets are pressure-based (in accordance with the MSFD definitions).

Belgium lists two specific targets associated with D11. Target 49 is a noise exposure that shall not be exceeded for impulse sounds. Target 50 addresses a non-increasing trend in ambient noise in two frequency bands. Overall, the measures contribute to addressing the Belgian targets. The existing measures are part of the licensing conditions for EIAs for offshore wind farms in Belgian waters. The new measure 30 is targeting military activities and, while it is not easy to associate it with a specific target, it might sit logically within target 49. It is however difficult to judge if it will have any effect at all. Measure 31 addresses target 50 but itis a consultation about potential future measures. The new measure 31will not be sufficient to achieve target 50, which is quite an ambitious goal. However, the measure will at least contribute to achieving the target (and ultimately GES). Therefore, the Belgian PoM partially addresses GES and targets.

Belgium has also provided information on how the new measures will contribute in achieving their targets: although a quantitative contribution towards meeting the targets is not possible according to Belgium, a qualitative effectiveness score is provided for each new measure by the Member State. This enables an indication of contribution towards meeting the targets: 30 (average), 31 (very high).";The measures partially address the D11 GES and targets. The measures address the D11 GES definition and one of the two D11-related targets.

BG ;BLK ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Bulgaria identified the introduction of NIS as a relevant pressure on its marine environment, pointing to aquaculture and shipping as the activities responsible for such introductions. 

The PoM addresses shipping although the specific actions still need to be developed as part of an action plan being prepared jointly by Bulgaria and Romania (measure BLKBG-M016-TRB). This measure focuses on several pathways of NIS, including ballast water and biofouling (biofouling regulations are mentioned in the associated policies for this measure). The action plan will include actions for the implementation of the International Convention for the control and management of ships’ ballast water and sediments (IMO) 2004 (measure BLKBG-M024-E).  
Aquaculture is addressed by measure BLKBG-M019-N. This measure also concerns the reduction of already introduced NIS. 

At the subregional level, Romania also identified shipping as a relevant activity for causing introductions of NIS into the Black Sea.
Overall, Bulgaria’s PoM will address the relevant pressure and associated human activities.

At the regional level, one of the Bucharest Convention’s policy actions addresses the threat from the introduction of non-native species. The Black Sea biodiversity and landscape conservation Protocol to the Convention of the protection of the Black Sea against pollution requires measures to regulate intentional species introductions and prevent accidental introductions of NIS and genetically modified organisms. The contracting parties should also endeavour to implement all suitable measures to eradicate or reduce NIS with harmful impacts on the environment. Bulgaria’s PoM, in particular measure BLKBG-M016-TRB, focuses on the prevention of NIS introductions, although reference is also made to the control and long-term containment of NIS. The action plan to be developed as part of measure BLKBG-M016-TRB will therefore presumably address both the introduction and adverse effects of NIS, although the focus is especially on preventing NIS introductions, considered as the most efficient approach. Bulgaria explains that once introduced, it is difficult or even impossible to eliminate species that tend to become invasive.";The measures address the pressure of NIS introductions and the relevant activities aquaculture and shipping. The PoM also includes one measure that links to the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ship Ballast Water and Sediments.

BG ;BLK ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets;"Bulgarian GES is defined in terms of planktonic communities, requiring that numbers and biomass of invasive alien species are below the thresholds for GES, as defined in the Bulgarian Art. 10 report, and that they do not have measurable adverse effects on the ecosystem. This presumably refers to setting a limit for biomass of Mnemiopsis leidyi (a problematic invasive jellyfish species in the Black Sea), which is also part of the Bulgarian D2 targets. Bulgaria’s PoM does not clearly state any actions to mitigate the effects of this species and maintain its population below the defined threshold values. It is true, however, that the threat from Mnemiopsis leidyi is decreasing, thanks to the unintentional introduction of one of its predators which has allowed the Black Sea ecosystem to start recovering . In its 2013 Articles 8, 9 and 10 text-based reports Bulgaria refers to Mnemiopsis leidyi but also includes the criteria that communities should be dominated by native species and that there are no introductions of new NIS. Bulgaria’s PoM, particularly measures BLKBG-M002-E, BLKBG-M024-E and BLKBG-M016-TRB focus on the prevention of new NIS introductions. Measure BLKBG-M016-TRB also refers to the control and long-term containment of NIS, although the specific actions to be developed as part of this measure especially focus on preventing NIS introduction, as mentioned above. 

It should be noted that the GES definition does not consider other groups of NIS, such as macroalgae and benthic invertebrates. It is also noted that the NIS rapa whelk (Rapana venosa), which has become an important commercially exploited species, is not addressed through the D2 measures. It is however covered by other descriptors such as D1, 4, 6 and D3 with measure BLKBG-M009-TRB. Taking into account the GES reported, the PoM addresses GES as it addresses the new NIS introductions and the reduction of already established NIS (e.g., BLKBG-M019-N). 

In its Article 10 reporting sheets and under Article 11, Bulgaria reported two targets. The first target relates to maintaining the biomass of Mnemiopsis leidyi below 4 g/m3 and the existing measure BLKBG-M003-E is indicated as relevant for this target. However, it refers to evaluations to assess changes to the ecosystem and the social and economic impacts of NIS in the affected waterbodies and such an evaluation will not achieve the target without follow-up actions. The second target included in the reporting sheets requires no new NIS introductions and maintaining the ratio of NIS to native species below a threshold of 10%. As most of the measures specifically addressing D2 relate to the prevention of NIS introductions, this target can be considered to be addressed. This assessment finds Bulgaria’s PoM to address the targets reported.

BG ;BLK ;13;D3 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Bulgaria identified fisheries’ activities - including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish) and other marine uses - as contributing factors to the pressure ‘extraction of species’ (fish and shellfish). Most of the measures address commercial fisheries, while measures BLKBG-M008-E and BLKBG-M008-TRB also explicitly address recreational fisheries and target trawl fishing and introduce temporary fishing bans. Additionally, both commercial and recreational fisheries are addressed by measures relating to protected marine areas (i.e. BLKBG-M014-TRB, BLKBG-M015-TRB). Other general measures (e.g. BLKBG-M018-N) will address the ‘various (not reported)’ uses referred by Bulgaria in the Article 8 report. The PoM is therefore likely to address the relevant pressure and activities. Both Bulgaria and Romania report the extraction of species (fish and shellfish) caused by fisheries as a pressure on the marine environment in the Black Sea subregion. Furthermore, Romania also identifies fisheries with vessels larger than 12m as a key element contributing to the pressure ‘extraction of species’. Both activities are covered by Bulgaria. 

At regional level, Bulgaria refers to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean within the new measure that covers gillnet control for turbot fisheries. Furthermore, it refers to the Bucharest Convention for several of its measures.

BG ;BLK ;13;D3 ;Coverage of GES and targets;"Bulgaria’s GES definition for D3 refers to all commercially exploited fish and shellfish species being within safe biological limits and exhibiting an age and size distribution indicative of a healthy stock. In addition, the GES definition also mentions Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) as a target, and that fishing activities should not harm fish habitats - particularly, seabed habitats - with their trawling gear. Bulgaria’s PoM consists of various existing and new measures related to the new CFP and includes measures to control fishing effort to achieve sustainable levels of exploitation for commercially exploited species by the setting of TACs and quotas for sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) (BLKBG-M007-E), fishing gear regulations (BLKBG-M008-E, BLKBG-M027-E, BLKBG-M008-TRB), minimum sizes (BLKBG-M029-E), implementation of the landings obligation (BLKBG-M031-E) and others. Age and size structure are addressed specifically through minimum size regulations, gear-related measures and spatial closures that may protect juvenile aggregations. Lastly, the PoM addresses the impact of fishing gear on habitats – particularly trawling gear - through gear and spatial regulations. Overall the PoM addresses D3, although it is not entirely clear that all commercially exploited species (e.g. thornback ray) are covered. Bulgaria’s PoM therefore mostly addresses GES.

Bulgaria has established 12 targets for D3 that cover the six main commercially exploited species: whiting, turbot, horse mackerel, anchovy, dogfish and red mullet. Sprat and turbot are managed through TACs/quotas. Sprat, turbot and the other species are all managed through various other regulations, such as catch prohibitions, temporary closures, fishing gear regulations, minimum sizes, reducing fishing capacity if necessary, and improved enforcement. Bulgaria’s PoM therefore covers the targets.

BG ;BLK ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Bulgaria, the main cause of eutrophication is nutrient enrichment from industry, agriculture, forestry and urban sources. The measures reported by Bulgaria address the pressures reported, as the existing measures focus on urban pressures, while one of the three new measures focus on diffuse sources – agriculture/forestry, albeit with an emphasis on contaminants rather than nutrients. However, there is little focus on agriculture. This is considered as a shortcoming in Bulgaria's measures for this descriptor. On the other hand, there are measures tackling activities which have not been reported by Bulgaria such as shipping or aquaculture. The PoM does refer to WFD measures. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the reported pressures and activities. 

At the subregional level, in the Black Sea, Romania also reports agriculture, urban and industry as the main activities causing of eutrophication. The measures reported by Bulgaria cover all these activities.

At regional level, the ʽStrategic Action Plan for the rehabilitation and protection of the Black Sea’ (2009) explains that the Black Sea ecosystem continues to be threatened by inputs of certain pollutants, notably nutrients from land-based sources, particularly through rivers.

All three targets are addressed by the measures reported, mainly through licensing regulations (7.1.1, 7.1.2: BLKBG-M0017-TRB), and review of dredging/disposal areas (7.1.3: BLKBG-M012-E and BLKBG-M020-N).";The measures partially address GES, as all alterations should be taken into account by EIA regulations, although no detailed information is provided on how the GES parameters or the potential cumulative impacts will be addressed.

BG ;BLK ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"Bulgaria reports the introduction of synthetic, non-synthetic compounds and radio-nuclide, as well as accidental pollution, as relevant pressures occurring in its marine waters in the Black Sea, in its Article 8 reporting. The introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds is due to industrial, agricultural and urban activities. Bulgaria also reports industry, port operations and shipping as responsible for accidental pollution. The measures reported by Bulgaria address these pressures and all reported activities, except industry in the case of accidental pollution. The measures therefore partially address the pressures and activities.

At the regional level, Romania also reported the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds and accidental pollution as relevant pressures in its marine areas of the Black Sea. Causes of introduction of synthetic compounds identified by Romania are marine hydrocarbon extraction, marine mining, industry, urban activities, shipping and solid waste disposal (dredge material), while marine hydrocarbon extraction, marine mining, shipping, solid waste disposal (dredge material) and industry are responsible for the non-synthetic compounds. Romania also reports urban activities and shipping as sources of accidental pollution. Bulgaria covers most of these activities. 

At regional level, Article VI of the Bucharest Convention addresses pollution by hazardous substances and matter: ‘shall prevent pollution of the marine environment of the Black Sea from any source by substances or matter specified in the Annex to this Convention’, while Article XIV is associated with the hazardous wastes in transboundary movement: ‘The contracting parties shall take all measures consistent with international law and cooperate in the prevention of pollution of the marine environment of the Black Sea due to hazardous wastes in transboundary movement, as well as in combatting illegal traffic thereof, in accordance with the Protocol to be adopted by them’. More precisely, a list of hazardous substances was provided based on their toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. This list includes both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds (mercury, cadmium, leads, DDT, PCBs and organophosphates), as well as radioactive elements. A list of noxious substances has also been provided. No list of potential activities that could lead to the release of such substances was provided, however. Finally, pollution is the subject of two chapters within the ‘State of Environment report 2001-2006/7’ published by the Commission on the protection of the Black Sea against pollution. Finally, the Strategic Action Plan for the rehabilitation and protection of the Black Sea explains that the input of several harmful substances (e.g. oil) still threaten the Black Sea ecosystem. These substances can reach the environment as a result of accidental and operational discharges from ships, as well as through land-based sources (half of the oil inputs from land-based activities are brought to the Black Sea through the Danube river). Bulgaria addresses these concerns through its measures.
";The measures partially address pressures and activities. In its Article 8 reporting, Bulgaria pointed to various activities as responsible for pollution in the Bulgarian part of the Black Sea. Almost all of these activities are addressed by the D8 measures. However, industrial activities as source of accidental pollution do not seem to be addressed by any of the reported measures. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/c59f5496-f414-4375-b87c-1ca753d7b9c3/details
BG ;BLK ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets;"The Bulgarian GES definition for D8 includes the following: 
•	The concentrations of contaminants in water and biota are below their maximum and average annual levels, according to environmental quality standards laid down in the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC and Directive 2008/105/EC, as amended by Directive 2013/39/EC.
•	The levels of contaminants and the associated biological effects are such that there is no direct correlation between the concentrations of contaminants in living organisms resulting contamination of the marine environment, giving rise to biological effects. The acute pollution events are prevented or are extremely rare.

Bulgaria defined a pressure target, which is similar to the GES definition provided above: limiting the pressure from point and diffuse sources of pollution, including from the atmosphere, and reducing illegal discharges from ships of various pollutants such as oil and noxious liquid substances and harmful substances. Bulgaria also defined five targets for D8 covering state and impacts.

The reported measures by Bulgaria relate directly to the targets defined for D8, which also directly address their GES. The measures address point and diffuse pollution including atmospheric deposition and acute pollution events. Bulgaria’s D8 targets state that the concentrations of hazardous substances in water, sediment and biota do not exceed limits according to EU’s Environmental Quality Standards directives (EQSD) (2008/105/EC, or as amended by 2013/39/EU). In addition, Bulgaria specifies that a target is a decrease in contaminant concentrations in sediments over long term. A reduction in accidental or illegal discharges is a target and several existing and new measures address this (such as BLKBG-M014-E, BLKBG-M015-E and BLKBG-M052-E). Moreover, new measure BLKBG-M001-TRB addresses the first element of the target definition (limiting the pressure from point and diffuse sources of pollution), while BLKBG-M004-TRB covers both elements of the target definition.

All reported measures refer to national and/or international policy relevant to D8 (e.g. WFD and 2013/39/EU (EQSD)). The Member State has also cited numerous times protocols under the Convention for protection of the Black Sea against pollution as well as MARPOL and Euratom (concerning radionuclides). Cooperation with Romania through the DG Environment funded project  which is coordinated with their new measure BLKBG-M001-TRB is a strong point in the PoM aiming to address contaminants. However, Bulgaria reports that, currently, existing regulation requirements on dumping of dredge materials and other activities are not clear enough about the responsibilities of the competent authorities. Therefore, the PoM overall partially addresses GES and targets. ";The measures partially address the GES and target definitions. The measures address point and diffuse pollution including atmospheric deposition and acute pollution events, as well as radionuclides contamination. Nevertheless, the Member State reports that the responsibilities of competent authorities regarding the disposal of dredged material and other activities are not clearly defined in existing regulations, therefore contamination from these activities can significantly inhibit the achievement of GES. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/c59f5496-f414-4375-b87c-1ca753d7b9c3/details

The introduction of hazardous compounds is due to industrial, agricultural and urban activities (and potential ‘other marine uses and activities’). Bulgaria additionally states that industry, port operations and shipping are responsible for accidental pollution. The measures reported for D9 address these pressures but partially address the reported activities (even though measure BLKBG-M002-TRB lists these activities as subject of the measure, it has not been explained how tourism, shipping or urban activities for example could be addressed by a measure focused on aquaculture). Nevertheless, the D8 measures address these activities (among others), with the exception of industrial activities in the case of accidental pollution. As such, the combined D9 and D8 measures partially address the reported pressures and activities.

Bulgaria reports four existing measures and two new measures for D9, and all of them are also relevant for D8. Bulgaria has specified the contaminant concentration limits, and even transposed the limits to suit certain species in its targets definitions. The Member State has also gone beyond the Commission Regulation 1881/2006 for foodstuffs and established limits for other substances (e.g. Aluminium, Copper, Chromium) in seafood, in line with their GES and targets’ needs. The reported measures, combined with the D8-related ones, are likely to address the targets which address directly the GES definition.

BG ;BLK ;13;D10 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Bulgaria identifies marine litter as an issue in the Black Sea, highlighting fisheries, urban activities and shipping as contributing sources. Both the existing and new measures target marine litter from urban activities, shipping and fisheries. Additionally, the awareness campaigns (BLKBG-M005-TRB) focus both on business and the general public, emphasising the impact of litter on the marine environment and the need for recycling. The revision of existing legislation (horizontal measure BLKBG-M017-TRB) is aimed at multiple activities at sea, including aquaculture, fisheries, and energy. Consequently, Bulgaria has defined existing and new measures to address the identified pressures and activities. Its PoM therefore addresses the pressure ‘marine litter’.

Bulgaria has clarified that it has recognised the pressure of microplastics (and related activities) as a relevant and very important issue for its marine waters. However, up to now, there is no data  at national or regional level. One of the actions taken is the inclusion of microplastics and its monitoring in the draft Regional Action Plan for Management of Marine litter in the Black Sea (ongoing procedure of final drafting of this document and preparation for adoption at the annual meeting of the Black Sea Convention in 2017), which will positively contribute in addressing data gaps in this regard. 

At the subregional level, Romania reports marine litter due to fisheries and shipping as relevant for its marine waters, in addition to tourism and recreation. Bulgaria also addresses these activities in its measures for marine litter. Tourism is also addressed by measure BLKBG-M005-TRB (indirect) through campaigns to raise awareness.At the regional level, Bulgaria refers to the adoption and implementation of the Marine Litter Regional Action Plan for the Black Sea (BLKBG-M003-TRB), which is one of the transboundary measures implemented in collaboration with Romania. 
";The measures address the pressure of marine litter. Bulgaria reports marine litter as an issue in the Black Sea and highlights fisheries, urban activities and shipping as contributing to the problem. It defines existing and new measures to address these sources of marine litter. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/c59f5496-f414-4375-b87c-1ca753d7b9c3/details
BG ;BLK ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Bulgaria defines GES as ‘The quantities of marine litter deposited on the shore are negligible and do not affect the beach aesthetic view. There is no marine litter floating at the sea surface, in the water column or deposited on the seafloor, or close to coastal ""hot spots"" as sources of waste estuaries, resorts, urbanised areas, public beaches and seaports, and in the open marine water. Reduction of registered cases of marine mammals, seabirds and fish found injured and/or dead as a result of imported marine litter in the environment’.

Measures have been defined that will likely reduce the amount of marine litter in general (for example with measures BLKBG-M017-E, BLKBG-M018-E, BLKBG-M035-E, BLKBG-M003-TRB, BLKBG-M004-TRB). Therefore, they will most probably also decrease the quantity of litter near the ‘hot spots’ and decrease the number of injured/dead animals. Still, no clear link was made towards tackling hot spots of marine litter or marine biota, as in the GES definition (it is implied), meaning that the PoM will partly contribute to the achievement of GES. Doubts also exist as to whether or not the PoM will achieve ‘no effect on the beach aesthetic view or no marine litter found’ due to the high threshold which has been set. 

Bulgaria has defined two targets (with no associated indicators for GES), which relate to beach, floating and seafloor litter: decreasing trend in the amount of marine litter both washed ashore and/or deposited on coastlines (target 10.0.1), as well as those floating on the water surface, in the water column and deposed on the seafloor (target 10.1.2). There were however no direct targets formulated related to injured and/or dead species, although specifically mentioned in the GES definition. It is likely that the existing and new measures will contribute towards a decreasing trend of marine litter in these areas. Indeed, both direct new measures have been associated with both targets by Bulgaria. However, due to the limited information available, the extent to which this is currently done is unclear. Consequently, the measures will most probably partially address the targets defined by Bulgaria. 
";The measures partially address the GES and target definitions. Measures are in place, which will reduce beach, floating and seabed litter. However, no measure specifically addresses hot spots of marine litter or marine biota (since the measures will reduce the amount of marine litter in general, they will most probably also decrease the quantity of litter near the ‘hot spots’, however, no clear link was made towards tackling hot spots of marine litter or marine biota), as per the GES definition, and it is uncertain that the measures will result in ‘no effect on the beach aesthetic view or no marine litter found’ (a high threshold has been set). ;2;Partially addressed;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/c59f5496-f414-4375-b87c-1ca753d7b9c3/details

CY;MED ;13;D2 ;Coverage of pressures;"Cyprus has identified the introduction of NIS as a relevant pressure on its marine environment in the Aegean-Levantine Sea, pointing to shipping and land claim/coastal defence as the corresponding activities responsible for the NIS introduction. However, the D2-specific measures defined do not address shipping and land claim/coastal defence but, rather, target other activities such as aquaculture and fisheries. 

Cyprus reports one exception linked to the introduction of NIS through the Suez Canal, which is described below. However, the Member State also identified ballast waters from ships as important NIS pathways under Article 8, and these seem not to be addressed through the PoM as there are no measures focusing on ballast water management. The PoM therefore partially addresses the reported pressure and activities. It is important to highlight that some of the horizontal measures might address activities such as shipping. The information provided does not clarify what such activities might be.

At the subregional level, Greece reports aquaculture and shipping as responsible for the introduction of NIS to its marine waters. Cyprus covers some of these activities.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s priorities is to monitor the spread of invasive species: ‘Non‐indigenous species introduced by human activities are, to the maximum extent possible, at levels that do not adversely alter the ecosystem’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators). Cyprus’ PoM addresses this issue.";The measures partially address the reported pressure (introduction of NIS) and activities as it only addresses fisheries and aquaculture impacts.

CY;MED ;13;D2 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Cyprus reports a three-fold GES definition for D2: NIS do not dominate the abundance/biomass of their taxonomic group/functional group within a predominant habitat type, especially in the MPAs; the introduction of primarily-introduced invasive alien species (PIIAS) by human activities (shipping, aquaculture, and the aquarium trade) is minimised; PIIAS are not established outside high-risk areas of impact (harbours, marinas, aquaculture facilities etc.), while their proliferation in high-risk areas is minimised. This definition is associated with three groups of GES indicators. The first (Cyprus' GES indicator 2.1.1) concerns abundance and state characterisation of NIS, while two others (Cyprus' GES indicators 2.2.1, 2.2.2) focus on the environmental impacts and the minimisation of the introduction of new PIIAS. The existing and new measures address these specific issues through their focus on the use of NIS in aquaculture and the reduction of the populations of NIS. More specifically, measure 20 should tackle 2.2.1, measures 21 and 23 should be relevant for 2.1.1, and measure 22 is suitable for 2.2.2. The general measures will also contribute to address GES because they consider NIS in SEA/EIAs and aim to develop a marine database.

CY;MED ;13;D3 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Cyprus identified the activities of fisheries - including recreational fishing (of fish and shellfish) - as a contributing factor to the pressure ‘extraction of species’ (fish and shellfish). Cyprus’ PoM addresses the pressure of ‘extraction of species’ caused by commercial fishing (24-32, 34). However, recreational fisheries are only covered by one indirect measure (35). Furthermore, the Member State addresses physical disturbance pressures caused by commercial dredge fishing activities (27, 31). 

At the subregional level in the Aegean and Levantine subregion, Greece identified fisheries as a relevant underlying cause of the pressure ‘extraction of species’. In addition, Greece explains in its Article 8 that vessels (larger than 12m) with mobile gears affecting the seabed (i.e. trawlers, dredgers) are especially relevant to this pressure. Cyprus, however, mentions various types of fisheries, such as passive gear vessels of less than 12 m, longliners, bottom trawlers and recreational fleets. Cyprus’ PoM clearly covers management or prohibition of fishing by mobile demersal gears that affect the seabed (e.g. measures 27, 29, 31). 

Cyprus’ reporting does not link its PoM to the CFP and therefore it is not clear whether or not all commercially-exploited species are covered. Therefore, the measures partially address pressures for D3. 

At regional level, Cyprus does not link its PoM directly to UNEP/MAP, but does link its measures to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM).";The measures partially address the activities of commercial fisheries for national stocks and recreational fisheries, reported under Article 8 as important causes of the pressure ‘extraction of species’. However, Cyprus does not link its PoM to the CFP. Therefore, it is not clear whether commercial fish species are sufficiently addressed.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/73a4f4b6-63ab-467f-bd4c-5ecfd2aed7d1/details
CY;MED ;13;D3 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Cyprus’ PoM addresses the GES definition for Descriptor 3 because Fishing mortality (F), Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) and age and size distribution of exploited species are all covered by its PoM. Its definition of GES for D3 refers to ‘Commercially-Important Species’. National fish stocks are addressed by the PoM, particularly through measures 24 and 36 for coastal and artisanal fisheries. However, it is not clear to what extent they are covered, because the PoM does not link to the CFP, which  is a gap in the reporting. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses GES.

Cyprus indicates that each of the existing measures addresses the six targets reported under Article 10, which link to Fishing mortality (F), Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB), Total biomass, Biomass index and fish size. Again, without links to CFP, and with the limited detail in the reported information many uncertainties remain on whether the measures are sufficient to support achievement of the targets. In addition, it is not clear to what extend national stocks  are adequately covered by the measures, as no CFP measure has been reported in the PoM. The targets are thus only partly addressed.

CY;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"The open sea waters of Cyprus are oligotrophic. In its Article 8 reporting, Cyprus stated that urban waste-water discharges and aquaculture activities represent sources of nutrients in its marine waters, but that these inputs are dwarfed when compared to nutrient inputs from atmospheric deposition and sub-marine ground-water discharges. The reported measures, both the general measures (not focusing on a specific activity) and those directed at specific activities, address the pressures and activities reported by Cyprus for D5 (these results are pending the WFD assessment). Its measures also tackle other human activities such as agriculture, forestry and shipping. 

At the subregional level, Greece, the other Member State in the Aegean-Levantine subregion, refers to agriculture/forestry, urban activities, as well as, in some cases aquaculture and industry. These additional activities are also addressed by Cyprus’ measures. Despite the generally oligotrophic nature of eastern Mediterranean waters, both countries acknowledge eutrophication to be an issue. 

UNEP/MAP identified pollution from land-based sources, urbanisation of coastal areas and mass tourism as sources of nutrient enrichment to the Mediterranean Sea. Cyprus’ measures are likely to tackle these pressures and activities in its waters.";The measures address the two key activities causing nutrient enrichment identified in Cyprus’ Article 8 reporting, i.e. aquaculture and urban land use, in addition to other contributory nutrient enrichment pressures from shipping, agriculture and forestry. These results are pending the WFD assessment.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/73a4f4b6-63ab-467f-bd4c-5ecfd2aed7d1/details
CY;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to its own definition, the marine environment of Cyprus will be considered to have achieved GES when human-induced eutrophication is minimised and/or eliminated, physico-chemical indicators (including nutrients) are in line with prevailing physiographic, geographic and climate conditions, and phytoplankton abundance, chlorophyll-a levels, macroalgal and seagrass Posidonia. oceanica populations are essentially unaffected by nutrient-enrichment.

Cyprus’ environmental targets further specify GES and define fixed thresholds for nutrient concentrations, as well as two threshold values (’Divergence < 25% from reference conditions’ and ‘Divergence < 50% from reference conditions’) for chlorophyll-a levels, Secchi depth, perennial macroalgal status, Posidonia status and dissolved oxygen concentration/saturation. 

All of the D5-specific measures are concerned with reducing nutrient inputs (from a wide variety of sources), with an emphasis on aquaculture. However, the (extent of) nutrient emissions from urban waste water is not well described and, when dealing with so many sources, reference to a nutrient source apportionment budget would have been useful. Despite this, D5-specific measures are concerned with nutrient load reduction to the marine environment, and both the D5 GES definition and the environmental target are concerned with achieving either nutrient level thresholds in the marine environment or minimising the direct and indirect impacts of elevated nutrient levels. The measures are thus fully in line with the targets and will support the maintenance of GES (these results are pending the WFD assessment). ";The measures address the D5 GES and target definitions.

CY;MED ;13;D7;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Cyprus, the main sources of hydrographical changes are port operations and coastal defence, as well as desalination and industrial activities, as reported under Article 8. In principle, these activities would be covered by the existing regulatory procedures for the authorisation of projects, which are addressed by one existing (horizontal) measure on SEAs and EIAs (however, coastal defence, port and industrial activities are not mentioned in the D7 PoM). The reported direct measure for D7 addresses desalination activities. Desalination activities produce waste-water discharges which are released into coastal areas. Discharges, which are highly concentrated brine solutions (and, depending on the type of desalination plant, sometimes also have elevated temperatures) influence coastal water quality in terms of the salinity profile as well as temperature (influencing density) and in turn oxygen solubility and availability. These in turn may have negative impacts on benthic as well as pelagic habitats. Finally, the PoM makes no reference to cumulative impacts. Overall, the PoM partially addresses the pressures.

At the subregional level, Greece, the other Member State in the Aegean-Levantine subregion, refers to urban and industrial activities, but also to desalination, agriculture/forestry and coastal defence. These additional activities would be, in principle, at least partially addressed by Cyprus’ measures.

By definition, the measures reported cover all pressures, as all projects which could adversely impact hydrological conditions are subject to the existing regulatory procedures. They are thus adequate to address the pressures identified by UNEP/MAP as relevant for D7 (urbanisation of coastal areas, land reclamation, etc.).";The measures partially address the relevant pressures/activities reported under their Article 8 assessment, as not all activities in Cyprus' reporting (i.e. coastal defence, industrial and port activities) appear to be covered. However, a horizontal measure that focuses on SEA and EIA applications for activities in the marine environment contributes to addressing D7 pressures. Therefore, it is likely that these activities are covered through EIAs/SEAs. Cyprus also targets desalination activities and their impacts on the marine environment through its PoM, which is positive. Cumulative impacts on habitats by multiple stressors do not seem addressed by the reported measures. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/73a4f4b6-63ab-467f-bd4c-5ecfd2aed7d1/details

CY;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"Cyprus reports the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, due to industrial, agricultural and urban activities, as well as shipping, as relevant in its marine waters. The Member State also reports shipping as being a source of accidental pollution. Cyprus reports several measures that address the pressures associated with the introduction of hazardous compounds (synthetic and non-synthetic) and accidental pollution, as well as the reported activities. The PoM therefore addresses the D8 pressures.

At the subregional level in the Aegean-Levantine Sea, Greece also highlights some activities as contributing to D8-relevant pressures: industry, urban activities, marine hydrocarbon extraction, agriculture/forestry, and shipping as contributing to the introduction of synthetic compounds, industry, urban, marine mining, aquaculture, marine hydrocarbon extraction and shipping for the introduction of non-synthetic compounds, as well as shipping as responsible for the accidental pollution. Cyprus addresses most of these activities in its D8 PoM.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is related to contaminants: ‘Contaminants cause no significant impact on coastal and marine ecosystems and human health’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators). Cyprus, through its D8 measures in the Mediterranean region, contributes to meeting this objective.";The measures address the pressures (introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, and accidental pollution) and activities (industry, agriculture, urban activities, and shipping) reported in its Article 8.

Eleven indicators are associated with this GES definition. Nine of them concern specific contaminants (Lead in sediment and two specific species, Cadmium in sediment and two specific species, Mercury in sediment and two specific species, PAH in sediment and two specific species, PCB in two specific species). The other two focus on the number of spills and illegal discharge incidents, and the amount of contaminant released.

CY;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Cyprus reports marine litter as an issue in its marine waters in the Aegean-Levantine Sea, due to industry, urban activities, tourism/recreation and shipping. Measures to counter the issue are in place, including awareness raising and beach cleaning. As Cyprus’ PoM features measures on beach clean-up, it states that recreational activities on beaches, together with fisheries, are acknowledged to contribute to the litter pollution of beaches. Other measures also focus on fisheries and urban activities. However, no measure seems to specifically target industry and shipping. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the pressures and activities identified in the Article 8 reporting.

Cyprus did not identify the issue of micro-plastics and related activities as a pressure on its waters and no measures appear to address micro litter.

At the subregional level, Cyprus’ neighbour, Greece, has identified fisheries, tourism and shipping as key activities contributing to marine litter. Cyprus has put in place measures to address some of these activities. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives relates to litter: ‘Marine and coastal litter do not adversely affect the coastal and marine environment’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators). UNEP/MAP also published a report on the assessment of marine litter in the Mediterranean Sea. It acknowledges the fact that this pressure constitutes a serious threat for the marine environment and is due to the densely-populated coasts (urban activities), the well-developed tourism and the passage of 30% of the global maritime traffic (shipping). These human activities thus represent some of the main sources of marine litter in the Mediterranean Sea. The report also mentions the growing concern about micro-plastics. Cyprus’ D10 PoM includes measures, which focus on some of these activities, developed in the framework of UNEP / MAP (see description above, measures 54, 56 and 60). ";The measures partially address the reported pressures and activities. In its Article 8 assessment, Cyprus reports marine litter as a relevant pressure from urban activities, tourism, shipping and industry. Although the PoM includes measures targeting tourism and urban activities, it does not cover shipping and industry. Micro litter does not appear to be addressed.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/73a4f4b6-63ab-467f-bd4c-5ecfd2aed7d1/details
CY;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Cyprus' GES definition, the marine environment of Cyprus is considered to be in GES if: the amount of marine litter on beaches and on the seafloor is minimized and, if possible, is effectively eliminated; mortality of individuals of the turtle Caretta caretta due to entanglement and impedance by marine litter is minimised and, if possible, is effectively eliminated. The GES definition is associated with eight indicators. The PoM addresses Cyprus' determination of GES, as it implements measures to minimise the amount of marine litter on beaches and the seafloor. Cyprus also includes mortality rates of the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) caused by the ingestion of marine litter. While it does not report a specific measure for this species within D10, it is likely that, overall, D10 measures will contribute to a reduction of marine litter, thus potentially reducing the mortality rate of the turtles. For biodiversity, Cyprus reports a measure to implement the Programme of Protection of Marine Turtles, including guidelines on turtle stranding, which could contribute to the achievement of this GES component (measure 2), which will contribute to D10 objectives. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the GES definitions. 

The PoM will support the achievement of the stated targets, as aspects such as litter item number and size are addressed. As for GES, one target is specifically linked to the mortality rate of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) (CY10.8).

CY;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Cyprus especially reports shipping but also marine hydrocarbon extraction, fisheries, recreational boats, oil and gas industry, defence operations (sonar and explosions) and marine research as sources of underwater noise in its marine waters. While it reports a measure to tackle this pressure, this measure solely focuses on hydrocarbon-related activities. Therefore, although Cyprus addresses the reported pressure, it does not cover all the reported activities and provides no justification for their exclusion. The measures therefore partially address the reported pressures and activities.

At the subregional level, Greece reports marine research, survey and educational activities, defence operations and shipping as contributing to underwater noise in its marine waters. Cyprus does not address these activities.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is associated with energy and noise: ‘Noise from human activities causes no significant impact on marine and coastal ecosystems’. With its measure, Cyprus contributes to meeting this objective.";The measures partially address the reported pressure (underwater noise) by focusing on one human activity, namely marine hydrocarbon extraction. It provides no justification for the lack of measures targeting the other reported activities (i.e. shipping, fishing, tourism/recreational activities, oil and gas industry, marine research and the use of sonar or explosions). ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/73a4f4b6-63ab-467f-bd4c-5ecfd2aed7d1/details
CY;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Cyprus has not yet defined a GES determination for D11 because of the lack of data. However, two indicators have been defined for the descriptor: for impulsive sound and continuous sound. Cyprus lists one existing measure which applies to all descriptors (SEAs and EIAs) and one D11-specific existing measure (related to a soft-start procedure for hydrocarbon exploration as part of SEAs, EIAs and according to the Offshore Protocol of the Barcelona Convention), as well as the three new horizontal measures which apply to all descriptors (database for the marine environment, institutional strengthening and ICZM). EIAs (and, to a lesser extent, SEAs) are project-specific assessments that usually concern relatively small areas (for example a specific area for a seismic survey). The MSFD, by contrast, implies a larger scale and wider spatial scopes (such as, for example, territorial waters and EEZ). The single D11-specific measure reported by Cyprus therefore has a limited spatial scope, and thus cannot fully address the indicators as defined for D11. Both indicators defined by Cyprus are pressure indicators designed to collect information on the intensity and distribution of underwater noise in its waters. A measure such as soft-start is applied in order to counter noise impacts in the context of a specific project. This particular measure - which might benefit marine life in some cases - does not address the MSFD indicators or the D11 GES determination. It is possible that Cyprus’ new database will include information on underwater noise distribution in its waters, but the information reported by Cyprus is too limited to draw any conclusions. 

As Cyprus has not reported any targets for D11, no conclusions can be drawn. ";Cyprus does not provide a GES definition for D11 but two indicators (for impulsive and continuous noise) are nevertheless defined. The only D11-specific existing measure in their PoM does not address these indicators. The horizontal measures might address these, but the reported information is too limited to conclude. Cyprus does not report any D11-related targets. The measures therefore do not address the GES.;1;Not addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/73a4f4b6-63ab-467f-bd4c-5ecfd2aed7d1/details

DE ;ATL ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"Germany has identified the introduction of non-indigenous species as a relevant pressure on its marine environment in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. Germany reports shipping and aquaculture as the activities responsible for the NIS introduction in the North Sea as well as shipping in the Baltic Sea. In the case of shipping, biofouling will be addressed by one new measure. The measures defined by the Member State address these pathways and additionally cover fisheries. Therefore, Germany addresses these pressure and activities through their PoM for D2, and goes beyond their Article 8 definition by covering an additional pathway.

At the (sub)regional level in the North Sea, the neighbouring Member States have mainly identified shipping and aquaculture as key pathways of NIS introductions. In the Baltic Sea, shipping is the main activity highlighted by the neighbouring Member States regarding D2 and, to some extent, aquaculture. Therefore, the German PoM covers the activities reported by the neighbouring Member States regarding D2. 

At the regional level, the German PoM measures for D2 indirectly address some aspects of OSPAR’s thematic priority of avoiding loss of biological diversity and achieving and maintaining healthy ecosystems. According to OSPAR and HELCOM, the main sources of NIS in the (sub)regions are aquaculture, shipping and fishing. Germany covers these activities.

The new measure on environmentally-friendly shipping (measure M405-UZ2-01) addresses several other environmental targets. As defined above, the existing measures address ballast water and aquaculture. The new measures address fisheries and shipping. Therefore, the German D2 PoM addresses all targets (preventive measures such as through measure M094-WFD, record of new species through measure M413-UZ4-03 for example or implementation of existing measures such as through measures M912-other and M913-other).;The measures also address the D2 GES and targets, as the main pathways for the introduction of NIS are addressed.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details

DE ;ATL ;13;D3 ;Coverage of pressures ;"Germany has identified the extraction of species (fish and shellfish) as the relevant pressure in the context of D3 in its 2012 reporting on Article 8. . It reported that extraction of species is caused by fisheries activities (fish and shellfish) in both subregions and aquaculture in the North Sea.  

Germany has specified, in its Article 8 reporting in 2012, that the German fisheries in the Baltic Sea includes trawl fisheries, such as bottom and pelagic trawling, and passive fishing techniques. Furthermore, it reports that the use of gillnets and entangling nets is widely distributed in the Baltic Sea for pelagic and demersal species. For the North Sea, Germany reports that fishing activities mostly cover trawling fisheries, using beam, bottom, and pelagic trawls. Furthermore, the Member State reports that in the Wadden Sea (North Sea) a mix of mussel aquaculture and wild mussel fisheries is a common practice, given that juvenile mussels are being released in designated areas and collected when they reach a consumable size.

Overall, the measures mostly cover the commercial fishing activities of fish and shellfish. Aquaculture in the North Sea is addressed through the mussel aquaculture management plan for Lower Saxony. Therefore, the pressure extraction of fish and shellfish is addressed.  At the (sub)regional level in the Baltic and North Seas, all neighbouring Member States have identified fisheries, including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish) as a key activity causing the pressure extraction of species (fish and shellfish). As Germany has identified this activity as a relevant pressure, and because its D3 measures include fisheries measures to cover this pressure, the Member State is in line with its neighbouring countries in the (sub)regional level for D3. Therefore, the relevant activities causing the pressure extraction of species are considered to be covered by the PoM. 

At the regional level, the German PoM measures for D3 are linked directly to HELCOM in the Baltic Sea and to OSPAR in the North Sea. Furthermore, one measure is linked to the Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation.";The measures address key pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting, by covering fisheries in both subregions and mussel aquaculture in the North Sea.

DE ;ATL ;13;D3 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The existing and new measures address the GES definition, which includes the following criteria: fishing mortality, spawning stock biomass, and the age and size distribution of exploited species. The German GES refers to all commercially exploited fish and shellfish populations of the Baltic and North Seas. Germany states that its measures address all commercially fished populations, and therefore the measures will support the achievement of GES. 

Germany will support achieving sustainable levels of fishing mortality, biomass, and age/size structure through the production of educational material on ecosystem-friendly fisheries management to influence consumer choices, implementation of additional fisheries measures, and through sustainable management of mussel stocks. Exploitation rate (F) and biomass are both covered through the existing CFP and federal fisheries measures. Germany does refer explicitly to addressing age/size structure in its additional new measures. The Member State also reports that it aims to change consumer behaviour through awareness raising measures, which will contribute towards reducing the age/size issues regarding commercial fish. 

Regarding targets, Germany reports that the existing measures and existing but not yet implemented measures address all targets and that they, therefore, support the approach of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for all exploited stocks (target 4.1). Furthermore, the measures are likely going to support the achievement of targets, such as that the stocks of harvested species exhibiting an age and size structure in which all age and size classes are represented and continue to approach natural conditions (target 4.2). Moreover, the measures will ensure that fishing activities do not impact other ecosystem components (non-target species and benthic communities) to the extent that the achievement or maintenance of GES is at risk (target 4.3), and that illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 goes to zero (target 4.4). Furthermore, the Member State indicates that new and completely new measures address targets 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. 

Even though this is not reported by Germany, the assessment does suggest that the completely new measure for the blue mussel management plan in the Wadden Sea National Park of Lower Saxony could also support targets 4.1 and 4.2.";The measures address the D3 GES and targets, as they address MSY, fishing mortality, spawning stock biomass, age and size distribution of exploited species, and impacts on other marine species caused through by-catch. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details

Germany does not clearly report the status of its achievement of the GES or when it will be achieved.

Germany states that currently available scientific information does not allow for a determination to be made as to the duration and degree to which the ecosystems will react to the measures or regenerate as a result of the measures.

Timeline of implementing the PoM
Germany reports timelines for the new and completely new measures. Most measures are in place as of 2016.

DE ;ATL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Germany, the eutrophication of its marine waters is caused by inputs of fertilisers and other N- and P-rich substances and biological disturbance. Germany considered the main sources of nutrients leading to eutrophication problems in its North Atlantic and Baltic Sea waters to be agriculture, shipping and urban discharges. The reported measures address the pressures reported by Germany in Article 8 for D5, mainly through the implementation of the relevant EU Directives (the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Directive on National Emission Ceilings for certain pollutants, the Nitrates Directives, and others) but also to comply with the Helsinki Convention (Baltic), the OSPAR Convention (North Sea), and the IMO-MARPOL International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The measures also tackle industrial emissions of nutrients through improved wastewater treatment. 

At the (sub)regional level, for the North and Baltic Seas, nutrient enrichment is identified as a pressure by the majority of neighbouring Member States. The human activities that are reported as being relevant (sub)regionally are mostly agricultural, industrial and urban. All these are addressed by the German measures. 

At the regional level, OSPAR does not identify specific pressures related to eutrophication, referring mainly to its impacts; as such, a comparison with regional pressures and priorities cannot be made in the context of this descriptor. According to HELCOM, inputs of nutrients stem from agricultural, forestry and aquaculture activities, restructuring of seabed morphology (dredging), shipping, land transport, urban and industrial uses. Most of these activities are addressed by the German PoM";The measures address all key pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting (i.e. agriculture, shipping and urban discharges), in addition to tackling industrial emissions.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details
DE ;ATL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"In accordance with Germany’s definition, GES for Descriptor 5 is achieved when WFD Good Ecological Status is achieved and HELCOM’s eutrophication classification tool (HEAT) is, at least, good and when the status of a “non-problem area” is achieved according to the integrated the OSPAR COMP eutrophication assessment ). All the WFD, HEAT, and OSPAR COMP classifications require data on nutrient and dissolved oxygen concentrations, as well as water clarity. Biological status is judged in terms of phytoplankton (including chlorophyll-a levels), macrophyte, and macroinvertebrate communities. All of these eutrophication parameters are either nutrient concentrations themselves or are direct/indirect indicators of the effects of changing nutrient levels. Therefore, the measures are aimed at reducing nutrient inputs to the marine environment and they address the GES definition.

The three qualitative, German targets for Descriptor 5 aim at the reduction of nutrient inputs from rivers, via remote entries from other marine areas and from the atmosphere. Therefore, the measures address the targets, since nutrient emissions from all three of the major activities (urban, industry, and agriculture) are covered —nutrient inputs via rivers are tackled through wastewater treatment (municipal and industrial) and agricultural practices, and atmospheric deposition of NOx from ships appears through specific measures and the establishment of a nitrogen emission special area in the North and Baltic Seas.

Offshore structures, pipeline cables, industry, agriculture, forestry, and urban discharges are all identified as the main causes of pressures. The reported measures, both more generic in nature and directed at some of these specific activities, are to addressing the pressures reported by Germany in Article 8 for D7. No pressure is excluded and it has been reported that cumulative impacts are also taken into account (even if the way this will be done is not explained).

DE ;ATL ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"It is important to highlight several remarks here:
•	Some measures (M018-WFD, M036-WFD, M101-WFD, M903-other, M907-other, M929-other, M402-UZ1-02 and M407-UZ2-03), identified as relevant for D8, could not be associated to specific human activities because of the lack of information in the PoM, especially for the existing measures. They have, therefore, been classified within “not specified” activities.
•	Germany reports “other marine uses” associated with the introduction of radio-nuclides. In this table, the measures associated with KTM 31 (“Measures to reduce contamination by hazardous substances (synthetic substances, non-synthetic substances, radio-nuclides) and the systematic and / or intentional release of substances in the marine environment from sea-based or air-based sources”) have been considered as relevant for the radio-nuclides related issue, even if they do not target them specifically.

In the Baltic Sea, Germany reports ‘agriculture’ and ‘shipping’ as activities contributing to the introduction of synthetic compounds. In the North Sea, the Member State reports ‘shipping’, ‘industry’, and ‘urban’ activities for the introduction of synthetic compounds, as well as ‘industry’, ‘agriculture’ and ‘urban’ activities associated with non-synthetic compounds. In the case of the introduction of radio-nuclides and accidental pollution, Germany reports ‘other marine uses’ as contributing thereto in both marine sub-regions. All reported pressures and activities are tackled by the measures mentioned. Moreover, Germany addresses atmospheric and riverine discharges.

At the subregional level in the North Sea, the Member States have mainly identified ‘industry’, ‘shipping’, ‘agriculture’ and ‘urban’ activities as source of contaminants and contaminants in seafood (D8 and D9). All these activities are addressed by Germany. In the Baltic Sea, the other neighbouring Member States in this subregion also report ‘industry’ and ‘urban’ as sources of hazardous compounds, which are also covered by Germany. Furthermore, in both subregions most Member States reported ‘shipping’ as a cause for accidental pollution, which is also addressed by Germany. 

At the regional level, the PoM addresses OSPAR’s objective of “preventing pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions and losses of hazardous substances, with the ultimate aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances”. Indeed, the measures focus on both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. They also target several human activities and topics that contribute to the release of these compounds to the North Sea. Hazardous substances represent one of HELCOM’s four focal working areas and are also covered by one of the thematic segments of the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (adopted in 2007). HELCOM recognises several pollution sources, such as industries, urban areas, rivers, agriculture, shipping, and harbours or oil platforms. Germany also addresses HELCOM’s concerns in the Baltic Sea regarding these pressures through its measures.";The measures address all key pressures and activities identified in their Article 8 reporting, including the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, the introduction of radio-nuclides and acute pollution events, and even go beyond by targeting other activities.

DE ;ATL ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The PoM addresses the GES definition in both subregions. For example, several measures contribute to limiting the concentrations of contaminants in biota, sediment and water so that it will meet the environmental quality standards, such as the WFD-related measures (e.g. M018 or M036), M406-UZ2-02, M408-UZ2-04 or M402-UZ1-02. M407-UZ2-03 can be considered as relevant to address the precautionary principle mentioned in the GES definition and detect the biological effects of pollutants (oiled seabirds).

Germany has defined five environmental targets under “UZ2” in 2012 and they are addressed by the measures, both with respect to inputs (current target nos. 2.2 for atmospheric deposition, 2.1 for riverine inputs and 2.3 from sources at sea, through measures M907-other, M402-UZ1-02 and M908-other for example), concentrations and effects in the marine environment (target 2.5 through measure M909-other), and acute pollution events such as accidental or illegal discharges (target 2.4, through measure M407-UZ2-03 for example).

A timeline for the implementation of the D9 measure is to be stated, as the timeline depends on individual programmes for munition recoveries at various locations in German waters.

DE ;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"Some measures concern diverse activities, such as mainly land-based activities. Therefore, they have been grouped within “various activities” and will be described below.

In the North Sea, Germany reports placement and operation of offshore structures, fisheries and shipping as contributing to marine litter. In the Baltic Sea, the reported activities are shipping, industry and tourism. The Member State does not report on the sources of micro-litter for any of the two subregions. 

In terms of pressures, the German PoM addresses and goes beyond what has been reported by defining measures on micro-litter. In terms of activities, the existing and new measures address, and probably even go beyond, what has been reported by Germany in the North Sea (they for example address urban activities), and clearly address shipping, industry and tourism in the Baltic Sea. 

At the subregional level in the North Sea, the Member States have identified fisheries, tourism, and shipping as key activities contributing to marine litter. In the Baltic Sea, the Member States mainly report shipping, tourism and recreation as a key activity contributing to marine litter. Several measures concern diverse activities (not explicitly specified). Germany covers these pressures/activities through its measures.

This assessment finds that at the regional level, the measures for D10 address OSPAR’s objective of substantially reducing “marine litter in the OSPAR maritime area to levels where properties and quantities do not cause harm to the marine environment”. Indeed, the measures focus both on sea-based and land-based sources of litter, developing removal actions and include an educational as well as a section on outreach. Moreover, HELCOM and OSPAR both developed a regional action plan  against marine litter  whose aim is to reach a significant decrease of marine litter. Therefore, Germany contributes to HELCOM’s and OSPAR’s actions through its PoM.
";The measures address relevant pressures in both subregions. They address macro and micro litter through measures targeting shipping, fisheries, industry and tourism. Offshore activities are targeted in the North Sea. Some measures are general and address several human activities at the same time. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details
DE ;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Germany has provided a general, non-quantitative definition of the GES for D10: ‘Good environmental status for the descriptor “marine litter” is achieved when litter and decomposition products have no harmful effects on marine life and habitats. Furthermore, litter and decomposition products should not support the introduction and spread of non-native species’. All existing measures and some of the new measures relate to the macro litter and are (operational) measures that directly contribute to the reduction of litter both on the coastlines and in the marine environment. Several new measures relate to the micro-litter (M418-UZ5-03, M424-UZ5-09) and are operational measures that will directly contribute to the reduction of micro-litter in the marine environment and coastlines. A reduction in the direct input of micro-litter is envisaged by some of the new measures. It is, therefore, assumed that the reduction of direct application of micro-litter will lead to a reduction of micro-litter in the environment (e.g. M418-UZ5-03). Finally, some new measures relate to the monitoring programme litter in the stomachs of Northern Fulmars (which is associated with the OSPAR obligations), which includes both macro and micro-litter , which allows for  an assessment of a  possible decreasing trend in litter pollution over time. In general terms, a reduction of litter on the coastlines and the marine environment will contribute to a decrease in marine litter pollution over time. Therefore, the measures defined by Germany for D10 address the GES definition. 

As far as the targets are concerned, Germany reports one overarching target for D10 for which three operational targets are specified. Each one of the three targets are specific and targets marine litter in the environment (beach, sea surface, water column, seabed, target 5.1), the micro plastics content of organisms (target 5.2), and other negative ecological effects (entanglement, strangulation, target 5.3). There is no overlap. The measures address the existing operational environmental target established in 2012.

In principle, , all measures can be linked either directly or indirectly to the three operational targets. Therefore, based on the available information and as a consequence of trend-defined objectives of the target, we may conclude that they address and contribute to achieving the target.

Detailed measure descriptions are provided for the new measures , with a clear link to the operational targets. All measures have been linked to one or more of the three targets defined for D10 (e.g. M407-UZ2-03 and M423-UZ5-08 are associated with target 5.1; M424-UZ5-09 is linked to target 5.1. and 5.2.; M405-UZ2-01 and M418 to M422 are related to all three sub-targets). Although a quantitative contribution towards achieving the target cannot be found, a qualitative description of the possible contribution of the measure to achieve it has been provided for each measure (as well as a descriptive cost-effectiveness analysis). ";The measures address the GES and targets. A direct link with the GES and targets was described for the new measures in the PoM. The definitions of all existing measures can be linked either directly or indirectly to the three objectives of the D10 related target. Both macro and micro-litter are tackled by the measures with some direct operational measures.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details

DE ;ATL ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Under Article 8, for both subregions, Germany reports marine based renewable energy, marine hydrocarbon exploitation, marine mining, shipping and defence operations as relevant to D11. Furthermore, for the North Sea, Germany considers fisheries and marine research activities to be relevant for causing underwater noise. In the Baltic Sea, Germany also reports tourism/recreational activities. All these activities are covered by the measures reported by Germany, which presents a very comprehensive D11 PoM, covering different relevant activities and reporting new measures aiming to decrease noise levels to reduce impacts on marine species (further described in the biodiversity section 4.9). 

Under Article 8, Germany did not identify light and heat emissions from power plants or offshore structures for example, to be relevant pressures. However, Germany has reported a variety of measures, which target these human activities, which is positive. 

At the (sub)regional level in the North Sea, the Member States have especially identified marine-based renewable energy, defence operations, marine research activities and shipping as key activities that contribute to underwater noise (they do not report anything concerning other forms of energy input). Germany covers these activities through its measures. In the Baltic Sea, the Member States mainly report marine-based renewable energy, defence operations and shipping as a key activity contributing to D11. Germany reports all these three activities as relevant and defined measures to address them.

At the regional level, OSPAR is working with other international organisation on this issue. The aim is to develop methods to assess the impacts of noise on marine species and to address the cumulative effects of different sources. OSPAR acknowledges the existence of many sources of underwater noise. Therefore, by focusing on a few of them, the German PoM for D11 partly addresses OSPAR’s objective. Moreover, HELCOM Experts Network on Underwater Noise (EN-Noise) has been created to work on underwater noise in the short term (2015-2017) and the HELCOM 37 (2016) meeting has adopted the Regional Baltic Underwater Noise Roadmap 2015-2017. The roadmap recognises the potentially harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on the marine environment and its species. It also highlights piling (for impulsive noise) and shipping (for continuous noise) as the two main sources of underwater noise in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM also mentions other sources). Therefore, the measures for D11 address HELCOM’s concerns through covering the shipping activity and other activities.";The measures address all of the pressures and activities identified in their Article 8 that cause noise inputs (marine based renewable energy, marine mining, marine hydrocarbon exploitation, shipping and defence operations, marine research, survey and educational activities, fisheries) and even go beyond them by addressing visual disturbances and heat inputs. They cover the main reported pressures and anthropogenic activities which are sources of noise pollution in the marine environment.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details
DE ;ATL ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The measures are comprehensive and address all aspects of the GES definition, except the one on EMF emissions for which there is no relevant measure. Indeed, measures M925-other, M425-UZ6-01 and M428-UZ6-04 cover the part of the GES definition about preventing human activities to generate noise that could significantly impact the marine environment in both (sub)regions. Measure M430-UZ6-06 enables to tackle the issue of light entering the marine environment. Finally measures M017-WFD and M429-UZ6-05 tackle the potential impacts of a temperature rise. As such, GES is currently partially addressed.

As far as the targets are concerned, Germany has defined five of them as well as their related indicators for D11. These include noise indicators for the MSFD (pulse-like signals and shock wave for target UZ6.1 and continuous noise including shipping noise for target UZ6.2) but also heat, EMF and light. The list of existing measures is comprehensive. In addition, Germany has defined eight new measures which are relevant for D11 (i.e. M405-UZ2-01, M408-UZ2-04, M425-UZ6-01, M426-UZ6-02, M427-UZ6-03, M428-UZ6-04, M429-UZ6-05 and M430-UZ6-06). Two of them (i.e. M426-UZ6-02 and M427-UZ6-03) are directly relevant to the targets UZ6.1 and UZ6.2, which also cover (broadly) the two MSFD indicators for D11. They are formulated very comprehensively, with clear objectives, methods, and budgets. The other measures are relatively vague and address more or less research and assessment needs. In some cases, there is no allocated budget and we can only find a reference to a further determination as to when the measure will become more concretised. However, the measures address the targets listed and defined by Germany (for example, the heat-related and light-related targets are covered by measures M429-UZ6-05 and M430-UZ6-06). The targets are, in some cases, very specific with measurable goals, despite the fact that, sometimes, knowledge on the impacts (for example those due to light and heat) is quite sparse (which leads to less ambitious measures). The missing measure would involve addressing the target on electromagnetic emissions and the related indicator (intensity of electromagnetic and electric fields) as mentioned previously. Therefore, one of the D11 targets is not covered by the measures reported by Germany.
";The measures partially address the D11 GES and targets. The measures address the issues associated to pulse-like/wave noise, continuous noise, heat and light, but there is no measure to address the EMF related issues. The defined GES for D11 in Germany outlines very ambitious goals. Consequently, the targets that have been defined by the Member State are ambitious too. The existing measures and the eight new measures identified by Germany constitute a good framework to progress towards GES. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/4be6f168-4953-42bf-aa29-47a25a2afd48/details

DK ;BAL ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting for both the North and Baltic Seas, Denmark identified the introduction of NIS as a relevant pressure on its marine environment, pointing to aquaculture and shipping as the main contributors to the introduction and spread of NIS in its waters. Denmark also mentions fisheries (fishing tools), tourism and recreation (private yachts) and the placement and operation of offshore structures (movement of offshore structures) as potential sources of NIS. However, Denmark further explained during the review process of this technical assessment that the importance of these other human activities is unknown.

Fisheries including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish), aquaculture (fin-fish and shellfish), tourism and recreation (including yachting) and shipping are covered by the PoM, as Denmark reports measures that directly target these activities. The measures include the implementation of regulations regarding NIS in aquaculture (M028), the IMO BWMC (M027; which also mentions the publication of information on the risk of spreading invasive species through boats and fishing gear) and the Strategy for the reduction of release of NIS from marine aquaculture (M006).
Even though no measure seems to address activities in relation to placement and operation of offshore structures, the importance of this activity has not been established. Hull fouling is only indirectly covered, by research and monitoring actions. Denmark provided additional details about the development of a new monitoring method using eDNA  with the aim of expanding the national monitoring programme and developing a report on issues and possible measures regarding biofouling on ship hulls (as a supplementary initiative). Therefore, the measures only partially address the pressure.At the subregional level in the North Sea and regional level in the Baltic Sea, most of the neighbouring Member States reported aquaculture and shipping as the main sources of NIS introduction. Denmark covers these activities through its measures reported for D2.

For the Baltic Sea, HELCOM identifies NIS as a pressure on the marine environment. Aquaculture, recreational activities/tourism, port activities (industrial and ferry), shipping and mooring/anchoring all contribute to the input or spread of NIS. Denmark covers some of these activities through its measures. For the North Sea, Denmark’s PoM measures for D2 address some aspects of OSPAR’s thematic priority of avoiding the loss of biological diversity and healthy ecosystems to a certain extent. According to OSPAR’s Intermediate Assessment (2017), the main sources of NIS in the subregion are aquaculture and shipping (ballast water and hull-fouling). Denmark’s PoM covers some of these activities.";The measures partially address the pressure of introduction of NIS and activities reported in Article 8, such as shipping (ballast waters) and aquaculture. The measures also cover additional activities, such as fisheries and recreational yachting. However, biofouling is only covered by monitoring actions that have indirect effects on the pressure.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/88b3669e-7f69-4ddc-a0f4-f62187d3d1bc/details
DK ;BAL ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The Danish GES definition for D2 requires that ‘the presence of invasive NIS may not result in unacceptable direct or indirect effects on marine fauna and flora’. The existing and new measures which Denmark has reported for D2 address the definition. All measures have direct impact on the environment (e.g. the implementation of the IMO BWMC as well as the publication of information on the risk of spreading NIS with boats and fishing gear (M027) and a strategy for the reduction of release of NIS from marine aquaculture (M006)). Denmark also provides more information about developing knowledge on biofouling and through the development of a method using eDNA to monitor NIS and the expansion of the existing national monitoring programme to include more NIS (supplementary initiative). Therefore, the PoM focuses on preventing the introduction of new invasive species, as well as monitoring existing NIS. 

Denmark reported two targets (and associated indicators) for D2, which are similar to the GES definition. Target 27 focuses on ship-borne transport of NIS. Target 28 focuses on the transport of NIS via fisheries and aquaculture activities. The reported measures address all relevant aspects of the targets. For example, M027 covers the introduction of NIS through shipping activities, while M028 and M006 cover the introduction of NIS through fisheries and aquaculture activities.

Overall, the measures address the GES and targets definitions. ";The measures address the GES and targets.

DK ;BAL ;13;D3 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Denmark included the pressure ‘extraction of species (fish and shellfish)’ as relevant for its waters in the North and Baltic Seas, listing fisheries’ activities (including recreational fishing ) as the main source of pressure. Denmark’s PoM addresses commercial and recreational fisheries through one general measure (the implementation of the CFP). At subregional level in the North Sea and regional level in the Baltic Sea, all neighbouring Member States also report fisheries as the main source of pressures for D3. Denmark’s PoM covers this activity through its measures.

In the North Sea, OSPAR does not identify pressures related to commercial fishing (other than indirectly, through its impacts on biological diversity and healthy ecosystems), as fisheries is beyond the remit of its work. This prevents comparisons with regional pressures and priorities in the context of this descriptor. In the Baltic Sea, one of HELCOM’s action areas relates to fisheries. HELCOM acknowledges the fact that fishing can have an adverse effect on the marine environment (stocks, for example). Indeed, fishing concerns both commercial and non-commercial stocks, and bottom trawling may damage species such as thin-shelled bivalves and starfish. HELCOM thus considers that fisheries can have an environmental impact on species in the region. Denmark’s measure for D3 focuses on the protection of commercial stock through the implementation of the CFP. However, the measure does not address adverse effects of fisheries on the environment (e.g. seafloor damage). ";Overall, the measure addresses the extraction of species (fish and shellfish), as per its Article 8 reporting, since the measure reported for D3 covers fishing activities (both commercial and recreational fishing).;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/88b3669e-7f69-4ddc-a0f4-f62187d3d1bc/details
DK ;BAL ;13;D3 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Denmark’s GES definition requires the ‘commercial exploitation of all fish and shellfish species’ to be sustainable. Denmark reports three targets for D3. Targets 14 and 30 both concern spawning stock biomass of commercially-exploited stocks: they should be managed according to MSY principles by 2015 where possible and at the latest by 2020 (target 14) and be within safe biological limits (target 30). Target 29 focuses on fishing mortality for all commercially-exploited stocks. 

Denmark reports one measure, the implementation of the CFP. Specific aspects of the implementation of the CFP that are mentioned include the management of stocks using MSY principles, the use of TACs and quotas, fishing effort restrictions, technical measures, ban on discarding, ecosystem-based fisheries management, and enhanced regional cooperation. The PoM provides additional information regarding the status of the different stocks in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat (eel, hake, mackerel, spiny dogfish, sand lance, cod, common and Torbay sole, European sprat, Norway lobster, haddock, saithe, European plaice, Atlantic herring, Norway pout, whiting, common dab, turbot, rock grenadier, European flounder, brill).

DK ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Denmark highlighted that the pressure ‘nutrient enrichment’ was relevant for both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, pointing to agriculture, urban activities (including municipal waste water discharge) and industry as relevant activities causing the pressure. All of these activities are covered by measures in Denmark’s PoM. Agriculture, urban and industry are covered by measures included in the RBMPs for the first and second WFD reporting cycles, aiming to reduce the input of nutrients from land, even though the PoM provides little detail on the content of the RBMPs or the relative importance of individual activities. In addition, the PoM includes specific measures on shipping and aquaculture, even though these have not been reported as key causes of nutrient enrichment. Pressures are therefore addressed.
At the (sub)regional level, Denmark’s neighbouring Member States identified the same activities as contributors to nutrient enrichment (in both the North Sea and Baltic Sea). 
At the regional level, eutrophication, as a result of nutrient enrichment, is a specific work area of OSPAR. According to the RSC, nutrient inputs contributing to eutrophication can come from point sources (such as industries) and diffuse sources (such as agriculture or households not connected to sewage systems). These activities are covered by Denmark’s PoM. According to HELCOM, inputs of nutrients stem from agricultural, forestry and aquaculture activities, restructuring of seabed morphology (dredging), shipping, land transport, urban and industrial uses. Most of these activities are addressed by Denmark’s PoM. ";The measures address all key pressures and activities identified in Denmark’s Article 8 reporting, i.e. agriculture, urban activities (including municipal waste water discharge) and industry.

DK ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Denmark’s GES definition for D5, nutrient concentrations correspond to the level of protection in Danish coastal waters as a result of the WFD, water transparency is sufficient to prevent the occurrence of unacceptable effects on flora and fauna, and the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water column as a result of the decomposition of organic matter is not at a level which adversely affects the biological diversity in the marine waters.

Denmark has defined 10 environmental targets for D5, and two sub-targets. The targets are quantitative and refer in most cases to values and thresholds set out in the WFD. The targets concern phytoplankton biomass and the concentration of chlorophyll-a, density of annual algae, planktonic algae composition, density of perennial macroalgae, occurrence of seagrasses, total nitrogen concentrations, water transparency and oxygen concentrations.  

GES and targets both refer to nutrient levels and direct/indirect effects of nutrient enrichment. Denmark’s D5 measures focus exclusively on the reduction of nutrient loads, assuming that the effect of nutrient enrichment is set at a level which occurs only at or below the threshold levels for nutrients, and thus address GES and most of the targets. For two targets – 35 and 53 (concerning oxygen concentration) – a reduction in organic loading pressure would clearly be beneficial but the PoM makes no mention of measures related to this. Denmark further explained during the review process of this technical assessment, that the reduction in nutrient loading is expected to subsequently reduce the organic loading as well as the internal pools  in the sediments. Denmark however recognises that there will be a time lag before this occurs. GES and targets are therefore partially addressed.

DK ;BAL ;14;D5 ;Exceptions ;Denmark applies an exception for D5 in the Baltic Sea only. It reports that the Baltic Nest Institute has modelled nutrient concentrations in central, deep parts of the Baltic Sea, and natural biological processes, and understands that slow water replacement between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are expected to delay the full effect of measures. It has therefore requested that an exception under Article 14(1)(e) of the MSFD be applied, i.e. natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned. No specific time estimate for achieving GES in the Baltic Sea is provided. However, it is also stated that ‘it is expected that the WFD’s RBMP will reduce the nutrient load from land-based sources by 2027 to a level that supports both the achievement of good ecological conditions in coastal waters and good environmental conditions in the open marine water areas (this implies that the surrounding countries also implement reductions in their nutrient emissions)’. This assessment finds the justification of the exception grounded. Natural conditions of the Baltic Sea would not allow for GES to be achieved by 2020 and historically-enriched sediment may continue to be a net source of nutrients for decades after nutrient loads to both fresh and marine surface waters have been sufficiently reduced.;New measures will start to be implemented in 2015 or 2016. While Denmark reports that GES will not be achieved by 2020 in the Baltic Sea, a grounded justification has been provided, and the PoM aims to achieve GES in the North Sea by 2020. The timelines are therefore appropriate. It should however be noted that one existing measure will be implemented with a delay (2019).;3;Grounded ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/88b3669e-7f69-4ddc-a0f4-f62187d3d1bc/details

These measures cover EIA and licensing and permitting schemes, as well as other activities in the coastal area and in the territorial sea. In addition, ports related activities are included in one of the measures, even though these were not identified by Denmark in its Article 8 reporting as a key cause of interference with hydrological processes.

In the Baltic Sea, however, various activities have been reported (all Member States report different activities associated with this pressure).

DK ;BAL ;13;D8 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Denmark identified the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds as an issue within its waters, pointing mainly to industry, urban activities, shipping and agriculture in both the North Sea and Baltic Sea, as well as marine hydrocarbon extraction in the North Sea. These activities are all covered by measures defined by Denmark for D8, including its commitments to WFD, OSPAR, HELCOM, REACH and IMO. Denmark’s Article 8 also reported accidental pollution as relevant, caused by port operations, submarine cables and pipeline, and shipping in both the North Sea and Baltic Sea, as well as marine hydrocarbon extraction in the North Sea. These activities are all addressed by the measures, such as commitment to IMO. 

At the subregional level in the North Sea, a majority of neighbouring Member States report industry, agriculture, urban activities and shipping as significant sources of contaminants, while, at the regional level in the Baltic Sea, most of the Member States report industry and urban activities as the main sources of contaminants. Also, all neighbouring Member States in the North and Baltic Sea, except Poland, report accidental pollution in their Article 8 reports, due to shipping in both (sub)regions, as well as port operations in the Baltic Sea. Denmark covers these activities in its PoM.

At the regional level, the PoM addresses OSPAR’s objective of ‘preventing pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions and losses of hazardous substances, with the ultimate aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances’. Indeed, the measures focus on both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. They also target several human activities and topics that contribute to the release of these compounds to the North Sea. Hazardous substances represent one of HELCOM’s four focal working areas and are also covered by one of the thematic segments of the HELCOM BSAP (adopted in 2007). HELCOM recognises several pollution sources, such as industries, urban areas, rivers, agriculture, shipping, and harbours or oil platforms. Denmark’s measures also address HELCOM’s concerns in respect of these pressures in the Baltic Sea. 
";The measures address the reported pressures and activities. For the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, the measures cover industry, urban activities, shipping, agriculture and marine hydrocarbon extraction through commitment to the WFD, OSPAR, HELCOM and REACH, for example.

DK ;BAL ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Denmark’s GES definition for D8 aims to avoid any impact in the marine environment due to inputs of contaminants. Denmark’s measures explain its commitment to various regulations such as the WFD, REACH and MARPOL (IMO), and also consider acute pollution events. One measure specifically covers some types of contaminants (M044). Therefore, the PoM addresses the GES definition.

Denmark defines two targets for D8. Target 38 focuses on concentrations of contaminants in water, sediment and living organisms considering the limits set under the EQSD, and specifically mentions some contaminants such as Hg, Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cr, Ni, As, TBT, PAHs. One measure has been specifically reported as addressing these contaminants (M044) and other existing measures have also been associated with this target: M044, M045, M046, M013. Target 39 aims to reduce the occurrence and extent of acute pollution events through prevention, monitoring and risk-based management of contingency plans. This is addressed by M047 and M045.

DK ;BAL ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Denmark did not identify any activities as contributing to the pressure of marine litter in its marine waters. Some of the reported measures, however, do address certain activities. One specific measure addresses waste from ships (which could also be relevant for fisheries and port operations activities), one deals with collecting litter deriving from recreational activities, and one with preventing the spread of litter (from various sources). In this way, the PoM addresses several activities causing the pressure. Denmark lists one measure specifically targeting micro-plastics (voluntary phase-out of micro-plastics by the cosmetic industry), highlights that the prevention of spreading macro-litter also leads to less micro-litter in terms of degradation of products, and includes micro-litter in the monitoring programmes established by one indirect measure. Denmark’s PoM presents studies showing that primary micro-plastics, deriving from cosmetics, for example, make up only a small volume of the micro-plastics in Danish marine waters, with most being degradation products. Other measures having more indirect effects (monitoring, research and awareness raising measures) complement the measures directly addressing the pressure.

At the subregional and regional level, most of the Member States in both the North Sea and the Baltic region highlight tourism/recreational activities and shipping as important causes of marine litter. The association ‘Keep Denmark Tidy’, which is listed as the organiser of measure M053, has pointed out tourism/recreational activities as a main source of beach litter, while measure M052 focuses on shipping activities. In the North Sea, all Member States apart from Denmark also point out fishing as an important activity generating pressure in terms of litter. It has been covered, to a certain extent, by measure M052 addressing shipping activities. Fishermen are also mentioned as a target group for the indirect measure concerning information and raising awareness (M015). 

At the regional level, the measures for D10 contribute to addressing OSPAR’s objective of substantially reducing ‘marine litter in the OSPAR maritime area to levels where properties and quantities do not cause harm to the marine environment’. The measures focus both on sea-based and land-based sources of litter, developing removal actions and raising awareness of the effects of marine litter. HELCOM and OSPAR have both developed a regional action plan against marine litter, the aim of which is to significantly decrease marine litter. Therefore, Denmark contributes to HELCOM’s and OSPAR’s actions through its PoM.";The measures address relevant pressures in both (sub)regions. Although Denmark did not identify any pressures or activities related to marine litter in its Article 8 reporting, measures address marine litter coming from several activities such as shipping, tourism, fisheries.

DK ;BAL ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Denmark reports different definitions of GES in its reporting sheet and its text-based report. Nevertheless, the definition provided in the reporting sheets seems to correspond to the second part of the GES definition provided in the text-based report. This assessment will therefore use the text-based report GES definition.The GES definition entails that marine litter and its degradation products do not have negative impacts on either the marine ecosystems or species (and does not support the proliferation of NIS), or on marine industries/professions related to the marine area (including tourism). 

The GES definition is quite broad and is partly addressed by some of the measures, which mainly aim to reduce the amount of marine (macro-)litter entering the marine environment via the different channels (land-based, such as tourism, and sea-based, such as shipping). Even though the aspects of NIS and socioeconomic impacts on industries are not specifically covered by the measures reported for D10, the reduction of levels of litter in the marine environment and the beach clean ups will contribute to address them.

Denmark lists three specific targets for D10, each of which is explicitly linked to measures. Target 41, concerning the mapping of the occurrence of litter in the water column and on the sea-floor, has been linked to M051; target 42, on collecting the scientific data available on marine litter to establish reference levels for 2015 and concrete measures for its reduction by 2020, is linked to M014 (Denmark also reports several supplementary initiatives that focus on collecting knowledge and data on marine litter in general, including micro-plastics and ghost nets); and target 43, on decreasing the proportion of litter on Danish beaches originating from beach visitors has been linked to M053.

DK ;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Under Article 8 for both the North and Baltic Seas, Denmark reported marine-based renewable energy generation operations, as well as marine research, survey and educational activities as activities responsible for underwater noise. Denmark covers these activities through its direct measures, and it also addresses defence operations, shipping and marine hydrocarbon extraction. In its Article 8, Denmark also mentions ‘detonation of dumped munition at sea’ as a potential source of noise. Denmark further explained, during the review process of this technical assessment, that it is a member of Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and therefore does not dump munitions. Also, some measures cover the effects of military activities (M056). Denmark also reports several supplementary initiatives that indirectly contribute to address these pressures and activities through research and monitoring efforts (mapping underwater noise to observe its effects on seals, whales and fish; contribution to a regional register for impulsive noise; monitoring the presence of mammals near offshore oil and gas structures; see details below in the ‘gaps, justifications and timeline’ section).

Other Member States in the Baltic Sea mainly report shipping, defence operations and renewable energy generation as the principle sources of underwater noise, while in the North Sea marine research is also pointed out (in both areas, other activities are also mentioned, albeit to a lesser extent). Denmark covers all of these activities through its measures. Shipping is, however, solely covered by the IMO’s voluntary guidelines.

At the regional level, the HELCOM Experts Network on Underwater Noise has been created to work on underwater noise in the Baltic Sea, and a Regional Baltic Underwater Noise Roadmap 2015-2017 has been adopted. This roadmap recognises the potentially-harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on the marine environment and its species, and highlights piling (for impulsive noise) and shipping (for continuous noise) as the two main sources of underwater noise in the Baltic. In the North-East Atlantic region, OSPAR adopted an Ambient Noise Monitoring Strategy in 2015 and undertook its first regional assessment of the pressure of impulsive noise in 2017. Denmark focuses on impulsive noise in its PoM, and only has one direct measure relating to continuous noise. The PoM states that the available data are insufficient to assess the extent of continuous noise.  

The measures therefore address pressures and activities.";"The measures address the pressure and activities reported in Article 8. They cover activities related to marine-based renewable energy generation operations, as well as marine research, survey and educational activities (even though ‘detonation of dumped munition at sea’ is reported under Article 8, Denmark ensures that it does not dump munitions; besides, some measures focus on military activities). Four additional activities, not reported under Article 8, are also addressed.";3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/88b3669e-7f69-4ddc-a0f4-f62187d3d1bc/details
DK ;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Denmark’s GES definition follows the MSFD for this descriptor, which is very broad (‘the introduction of energy and noise is at levels that do not adversely affect the marine environment’). It is therefore addressed by most of the D11-specific measures.  

Denmark defined one target for underwater noise and energy under Article 10. It focuses on activities that are sources of impulsive sound with a negative impact on the marine environment. It mentions the implementation of relevant mitigation measures, as well as the period and geographical areas of noise introduction (that should correspond to limited potential damage to marine organisms). The existing measures refer to already implemented legislation, such as the requirement of conditional permits, and mandatory SEA for activities causing noise disturbance. One new measure requires operators to restrict the amount of noise they generate. These regulations, as well as the existing measure demanding a ‘soft start’ when performing seismic surveys and construction work (impulsive noise), should have the potential to assure compliance with target 44. Thus, target 44 is addressed by the PoM. Denmark also contributed to ICES’s register for impulse noise through the provision of noise data related to seismic surveys and major construction projects at sea. This could also contribute to address this target, to some extent.

It should be noted that there is no target for continuous noise, although this type of noise is likely to be included in the GES definition.";"The measures address GES and the target. The PoM aims to limit the impact of the introduction of underwater noise from several sources (such as shipping for continuous noise and seismic surveys for impulsive noise for example) on the marine environment. It should still be noted that the GES definition is very broad and that no targets have been set for continuous noise.

Denmark analysed the likelihood of achieving the set targets on time, rather than providing a timeline to achieve GES. However, the PoM as a whole, states the ambition is to achieve GES by 2020. This assessment assumed that this also applied to D11, although only to impulsive noise, given the knowledge gaps and lack of targets relating to continuous noise.

Timeline for implementation of the PoM

EE;BAL ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Estonia identified the introduction of NIS as a relevant pressure on its marine environment, pointing to shipping as contributor to the introduction and spread of NIS in its waters. Estonia directly addresses shipping (ballast water) in its PoM and, in addition to it, indirectly covers tourism and fishing by means of a measure on awareness-raising efforts. However, biofouling does not seem to be covered by any measure defined for D2. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the pressures and activities.

At the regional level in the Baltic Sea, the majority of the neighbouring Member States have identified aquaculture and shipping as key pathways of NIS introduction. Estonia covers shipping activities (ballast water) in its measures defined for D2 but not aquaculture, which, as further clarified by Estonia, does not take place in its territory. 

HELCOM identifies NIS as a pressure on the Baltic Sea, with the most important vectors being aquaculture, recreational activities/tourism, port activities (industrial and ferry), shipping and mooring/anchoring all contributing to the input or spread of NIS. While either directly or indirectly most of these activities are covered by the PoM, aquaculture is not. Regarding shipping, only ballast water is mentioned but not biofouling.";The measures partially address the pressure of introduction of NIS. Indeed, only shipping in terms of ballast water is covered. No measure seems to address bio-fouling. Other activities, such as fishing and tourism, are covered by measures with indirect effects on the pressures.

EE;BAL ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets ;"GES defined by Estonia aims to maintain NIS abundance below a certain threshold for pelagic and benthic invertebrates, zooplankton and macrozoobenthos communities. The reported measures address this definition by reducing new NIS introductions from some activities (either directly or indirectly), helping to prevent an increase of NIS population or even to reduce the number of already present NIS. 

Estonia’s two targets for NIS (8 and 9 in Art.10) aim to avoid new NIS introduction through primary invasions and to prevent a significant long-term threat for native species, populations and ecosystems. While the reported measures help to reduce NIS introductions and even though the new measures have been linked to all targets, the reduction of the long-term impact of NIS will only be indirectly addressed via monitoring, research and awareness-raising, potentially improving early detection of NIS.

Overall, the PoM partially addresses progress towards GES and targets for NIS. ";The measures partially address GES and targets.

EE;BAL ;13;D3 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Estonia reported the pressure ‘extraction of species, fish and shellfish’ to be relevant for its waters, listing fisheries as the only related activity. Fisheries are directly addressed by several measures tackling both technical restrictions but also wider management plans. Estonia also reported the pressure ‘extraction of species, seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting’; however, no measure seems to address it. It is not clear either, whether the PoM fully addresses recreational fishing (it is only mentioned to some extent in measures M008 and M005). Measure M006, while it does not have direct impacts, could in the long-term have an indirect effect by lifting some pressure from species more popular with consumers. Therefore, the measures partially address the pressure.

At the regional level in the Baltic Sea, all neighbouring Member States reported fisheries as a relevant source of the pressure 'extraction of species'. Most of them did not report anything regarding the extraction of seaweed. Estonia addresses fisheries through its measures.

At the regional level, one of HELCOM’s action areas relates to fisheries. HELCOM acknowledges the fact that fishing can have an adverse effect on the marine environment (stocks for example). Indeed, fishing concerns both commercial and non-commercial species and bottom trawling may damage species such as thin-shelled bivalves and starfish as well as seabed habitats. Thus, HELCOM considers that fisheries can have an environmental impact on species in the region. Estonia addresses this concern, although it tackles fisheries in a broad manner.";The measures partially address the reported pressures and activities. Even though commercial fisheries are covered, seaweed harvesting is not addressed and it is not clear whether recreational fishing is fully covered.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/444be744-bb88-4898-90fb-80af5f0a1f63/details
EE;BAL ;13;D3 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Estonia based its GES definition on different indicators: fishing mortality for the Baltic herring and the Baltic sprat, NIS by-catch per fishing effort unit, smolt production of Baltic salmon versus the level of natural production capacity, and some population-related variables for perch (e.g. abundance and length). Spawning stock biomass and age/size distribution (separately for males and females) are also considered. Threshold values are not provided for most of the indicators. Fishing mortality for Baltic herring, sprat and salmon are addressed through the existing measures of the CFP and data collection through the Data Collection Framework. For perch, Estonia’s Fishing Act and new measures M005 and M007 can help to manage exploitation of these and other non-CFP stocks. Age/size distribution can be addressed through new measure M005 to update the size limits of commercial fish. NIS by-catch is also mentioned in new measure M006. However, it is not clear whether the impact of recreational fishing on achieving GES is fully addressed.

Three targets are provided by Estonia. Target 10 aims to keep fishing mortality within the levels that ensure the long-term survival of fish populations, target 11 tackles the maintenance of the reproductive capacity of the fish stocks (SSB) to ensure long-term population survival, and target 12 deals with the age and size of commercial fish populations regarding long-term survival. Targets refer to the same species as GES. Measure M005, if implemented across all relevant species, will contribute to the management of the exploitation of fish stocks (targets 10 and 11), including age/size distribution (target 12). Measures M007 and M008 will also help to control fishing effort, especially regarding targets 10 and 11. Measure M006 may reduce the pressure on other commercially-exploited species, but is less directly relevant than the other measures. Finally, a link between the new measures and all targets has been provided by Estonia. The measures therefore address the targets. 

The PoM addresses GES and targets for D3.";The measures address the D3 GES and targets. The PoM relies heavily on CFP-related measures. Still, new measures are reported in order to directly address age/size structure, reduce pressure on certain stocks and mortality due to ghost fishing, as well as adapting fleet capacity to help achieve GES. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/444be744-bb88-4898-90fb-80af5f0a1f63/details

EE;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"Nutrient / organic enrichment is identified as the only pressure driving eutrophication in the Baltic Sea, with Estonia recognising inputs from agriculture and forestry, shipping and urban sources as being major contributors to the pressure. Estonia’s existing measures are aimed directly at these three activities: changes to intensive pig and poultry husbandry in the IED appear to be being dealt with through the livestock farming components of an updated code of good agricultural practice (Nitrates Directive), and the promotion of on-farm nutrient budgeting is a logical step forward to reducing pressure from this activity. Urban wastewater has largely been addressed under the UWWT Directive, with smaller discharges handled under HELCOM recommendation 28E/6. Implementation of the two EU Detergent Regulations could potentially reduce the total land-derived phosphorus pressure, as well as the phosphorus load derived from urban activities. Estonia’s two new measures are intended to fill gaps in the existing measures, and are well matched to those activities identified as being substantial contributors to pressures. Presumably shipping has been identified as an important contributor to atmospheric deposition of NOx, but the uptake of LNG-fuelled ship engines is dependent on economic factors which could complicate matters greatly. Improved storm-water treatment, including larger tanks to reduce the frequency and overall period of operation of coastal combined sewer overflows, should result in a larger decrease in organic loads to the sea than nutrient discharges. Agricultural organic emissions are probably reduced (naturally) to a greater extent than nutrients in rivers (before reaching the sea), so tackling storm-water treatment at coastal waste water treatment plants makes particularly good sense for reducing organic loads. Overall, existing, planned and new measures address the reported pressures and activities. 

At the regional level in the Baltic Sea, nutrient enrichment is identified as a pressure by all neighbouring Member States. The majority of them reported specifically industrial, agricultural and urban activities as relevant. These are addressed by the measures reported in the Estonian PoM. Indeed, even though no measure specifically addresses industry, it is very likely to be covered by general measures listed in the PoM, and especially through the implementation of the IED as one of its existing measures.

At regional level, HELCOM identifies land-based activities (agriculture and forestry, urban areas, industry, aquaculture, transport and energy production) and sea-based activities (shipping and aquaculture) as the main sources contributing to nutrient and organic enrichment. These are addressed by the Estonian PoM.";"The measures reported by Estonia address nutrient emissions from urban, agricultural and forestry and shipping activities. The implementation of the UWWT and Nitrates Directives, together with regulations on detergent phosphorus content, are expected to reduce nutrient enrichment of the sea; shipping-derived nutrient and organic loads are currently regulated through IMO legislation. Three new measures are proposed to help further reduce emissions from shipping, land-based and aquaculture sources. Other activities are also covered by the measures such as port operations or industry.";3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/444be744-bb88-4898-90fb-80af5f0a1f63/details
EE;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Estonia defines eutrophication in terms of threshold values. These are expressed through the following environmental quality ratios, for which reference conditions must be known: concentration of nutrient (N and P in summer, inorganic nitrogen and phosphates (DIN and DIP) in winter, in seawater), summer concentration of chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton wet weight biomass and secchi depth, proportion of annual and perennial species in benthic vegetation, depth distribution of phytobenthos and the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus.

Estonia has set three eutrophication-related targets:
•	Target 16 (in Art.10): Increasing nutrient content in water column does not cause either direct or indirect negative impact to ecosystem and biodiversity. 
•	Target 17 (in Art.10): Increased phytoplankton and filamentous macroalgae biomass does not affect water quality, sea water transparency or cause indirect negative impacts to the ecosystem and biodiversity. 
•	Target 18 (in Art.10): Amount of nutrients in marine water does not cause significant deviation from species natural distribution patterns. 

All of the existing and new measures are designed to reduce nutrient loads from point and diffuse sources from various sectors to the sea and thus, nutrient concentrations in the water column. Impacts of nutrient enrichment are also considered in the measures. More specifically, the new measures M009 and M010 enable a reduction in the input of nitrogen and phosphorous from the air, reduce DIN and DIP concentrations, the chlorophyll-a concentration and the oxygen deficiency at bottom layers and should lead to increased water transparency.

EE;BAL ;14;D5 ;Exceptions ;"Estonia applies an exception for D5. The PoM, in an introduction for the exceptions, mentions MSFD Article 14 (1) but it does not further explain which point of this Article is used for the D5-related exception. However, the Member State further clarified that Article 14 (1)(e) ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’ has been used for this exception. Estonia reports that the achievement of environmental targets is largely dependent on the efficiency of the implementation of the PoM of Water Management Plan 2015-2021. However, it is noted that the natural specificities of the Baltic Sea as a very enclosed marine area should be taken into account (limited water exchange with the North Sea and accumulation of nutrients in the seabed sediments over the past decades). Existing research on potential climate change impacts on the Baltic Sea demonstrates that the extent of oxygen-deficient areas in its deeper basins may expand in the future, possibly leading to the release of nutrients from sediments and increased levels of dissolved nutrients in the water column. The Member State concludes that, against this background, the environmental targets and GES for eutrophication are unlikely to be achieved by 2020.

This assessment finds the justification of the exception grounded. Natural conditions of the Baltic Sea would indeed not allow for GES to be achieved by 2020 and historically-enriched sediment may continue to be a net source of nutrients for decades after nutrient loads to both fresh and marine surface waters have been sufficiently reduced.

EE;BAL ;13;D7;Coverage of pressures ;"Estonia reports hydrographical changes as a pressure in its marine waters and identifies land claim and coastal defence, industry discharges and emissions, port operations, as well as submarine cable and pipeline operations as the main activities contributing to this pressure. Out of these activities, only coastal defence and land claim are targeted by specific measures. Other activities identified as contributors to hydrographical changes in Estonia’s Article 8 report appear not to be explicitly covered by any of the detailed measures, both existing and planned. However, it can be reasonably assumed that they are covered by the measures related to MSP and integrated marine and coastal management outlined by the Member State. Estonia did not identify sediment extraction as a relevant activity but has defined a dedicated measure covering this issue, highlighting its relevance for this pressure in Estonia’s marine waters. Also, it is not clear whether or not the PoM covers cumulative impacts. 

At the regional level in the Baltic Sea, most neighbouring Member States report the (disturbance of) hydrological processes as a pressure on their marine environment (except Latvia and Sweden). In general, the human activities reported as relevant regionally are industry, land claim/coastal defence, port operations, placement/operation of offshore structures and tourism/recreational activities. Nevertheless, no activity has been reported by a majority of Member States in the region to cause the pressure. The measures reported only partially cover the pressures identified. 

The maritime activities identified by HELCOM as relevant for D7, such as aquaculture, marine-based renewable energy, extraction of minerals, oil and gas, all types of physical restructuring of the coastline or seabed, tourism infrastructure, transport infrastructure and military operations are only partially addressed by the measures reported by Estonia.

At the regional level in the Baltic Sea, the majority of the neighbouring Member States reported industry and urban activities as the main sources of hazardous compounds, while port operations and shipping have especially been reported as sources of accidental pollution. Estonia covers these activities through its PoM. 

The Estonian measures for D8 and D9 are in line with HELCOM’s objective regarding hazardous substances: concentrations of hazardous substances close to natural levels, all fish are safe to eat, healthy wildlife and radioactivity at the pre-Chernobyl level. Indeed, the measures focus on both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. They also target several human activities and topics that contribute to the release of these compounds in the Baltic Sea.";The measures address the reported pressures and activities. For the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, industry, urban and shipping activities are covered. For acute pollution events, Estonia’s PoM addresses marine-based renewable energy generation, dredging, industry, port operations, submarine cable/pipeline operations and shipping (even though no measure specifically addresses marine-based renewable energy generation as well as submarine cable/pipeline operations, they are very likely to be covered by general measures targeting various activities). ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/444be744-bb88-4898-90fb-80af5f0a1f63/details

EE;BAL ;14;D8 ;Exceptions ;"Estonia applies an exception for D8. The PoM, in an introduction for the exceptions, mentions Article 14 (1) but it does not further explain which point of this Article is used for the D8-related exception. Natural conditions are mentioned and Estonia further clarified that  Art.14 (1)(e) ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’ has been used. Estonia reports that the achievement of environmental targets is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the implementation of the PoM for the Water Management Plan 2015-2021. The specificities of the Baltic Sea should be taken into account: a very closed basin and the accumulation of contaminants in sediments. Due to the lack of knowledge about the contaminants in the marine environment exceeding the EQS (their origin, spread, and biogeochemical processes releasing them from the sediments), it is not possible to define targeted measures to control the pressure. Therefore, it is very likely that GES, for all contaminants, will not be achieved by 2020, especially due to natural conditions in the Baltic Sea. In order to clarify the problem and implement possible measures, a number of studies have been proposed that would need to be carried out in the near future (including geological studies in the Estonian marine area). The environmental targets for managing environmental pollution risk (including monitoring and pollution response) under D8 can be achieved by implementing the measures defined under the Interior Security Development Plan and measures in this PoM. Sufficient anti-pollution capability is ensured in cooperation with neighbouring countries.

This assessment finds the justification of the exception grounded. Some contaminants are indeed persistent and take a long time to break down in the marine environment, depending on natural conditions, and therefore accumulate in sediments. The Member State also did not specify when GES is expected to be achieved (in relation to Article 14(1)(e)).";Estonia applies an exception for D8 under Article 14 (1).

EE;BAL ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Estonia identified marine litter as a pressure in its marine waters due to tourism and recreational activities including yachting as well as shipping. The measures address these activities. Additional activities are also covered. One specific measure addresses abandoned fishing gear and several measures address marine litter coming from both land-based (waste management on land) and sea-based sources. In this way, the PoM addresses the pressures and activities identified in Article 8. Estonia reported that there is a lack of data and knowledge on micro-litter and its impact on marine organisms. In the Baltic Sea, the impact of micro-plastic in the ecosystem has not been thoroughly investigated. However, HELCOM's Baltic Sea marine litter action plan considers the necessary research to determine the main sources of micro-plastics, their routes into the marine environment and assess the impacts of micro-plastics on the marine environment. Estonia reports that one of the first steps would be the development of monitoring methods and pilot monitoring in the Estonian marine area. Based on the study results, it will be possible to propose a micro-plastic monitoring plan for the future, assess the quantities and characteristics of the micro-plastics in the water column, and indicate possible sources (entry through rivers, wastewater outlets). Even though micro-litter is not covered yet by any measure in the PoM, it is recognised as an important source of pressure by Estonia, which has set up a pilot monitoring about it.

At the regional level in the Baltic Sea, the majority of the Member States highlight tourism/recreational activities and shipping as important causes of marine litter in the Baltic Sea region. Estonia has put in place measures to cover these activities. 

Estonia’s measures for D10 will contribute to HELCOM’s regional action plan on litter, as evidenced by all its planned actions, especially under an existing but not yet implemented measure (HELCOM recommendation 29/2).";The measures address the reported pressure and cover the reported activities. Estonia has defined measures tackling marine litter that comes from the two activities identified in Article 8: shipping and tourism/recreation. New measures also cover fisheries and port operations, as well as awareness raising efforts for the public and waste management plans (that include land-based sources of litter).

It should be noted that the targets as defined in the PoM have been updated compared to the definitions provided under Article 10 in 2013. This assessment therefore relies on the definitions provided in the PoM text-based report, since the targets in the PoM are indeed the most recent ones. Existing and new measures will contribute to a reduction in marine litter and thus contribute towards the target for D10. All three new measures are linked in a general way to both target 26 (beach, micro-litter, seabed) and target 27 (condition of marine biota and habitat). However, it is not clear to what extent they will contribute to a reduction of a particular type of litter (especially in water column, seabed and/or micro/macro-litter; while litter found on the beach may be covered by measures focusing on coastal waste management (e.g. M015), no measure addresses micro-litter, as explained above, for example).

EE;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Under Article 8, Estonia reported port and defence operations as well as shipping as responsible for introducing underwater noise. Estonia addresses the reported pressures and activities through its measures. It should be noted that Estonia defined a measure about the development of a registry for impulsive noise that will cover several activities generating underwater noise such as pile-driving, explosions, use of low frequency sonars (however this measure focuses on gathering data and information and therefore only has an indirect impact on the pressures).

At the regional level, in the Baltic Sea, the Member States mainly mention marine-based renewable energy generation, defence operations and shipping as the principle sources of underwater noise (other activities are mentioned to a lesser extent). Estonia covers defence operations and shipping activities through its measures. As clarified by Estonia, there is currently no marine-based renewable energy generation activity in its territorial waters, although if in the future such activity is developed, it will be covered by the measure reported by Estonia about SEA and EIA. 

A HELCOM Experts Network on Underwater Noise (EN-Noise) has been created to work on underwater noise in the short term (2015-2017) and the HELCOM 37 (2016) meeting has adopted the Regional Baltic Underwater Noise Roadmap 2015-2017. The roadmap recognises the potentially harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on the marine environment and its species. It also highlights piling (for impulsive noise) and shipping (for continuous noise) as the two main sources of underwater noise in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM also mentions other sources). Estonia focuses on this pressure and some of these activities in its PoM.";Estonia’s PoM addresses the pressures and covers activities identified in the Article 8 reporting (port operations, defence operations, shipping).

EE;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Estonia has not defined GES for underwater noise (D11). Therefore, it cannot be concluded whether the PoM addresses the GES definition.

Estonia has reported three targets under Article 10: 
•	Target 2. Abundance of populations of key species is at levels which assure long term preservation/ conservation of the populations.
•	Target 28. Loud, low and medium frequency impulse sounds do not cause remarkable deviations in habitat quality of marine life.
•	Target 29. Permanent low frequency sound does not cause remarkable negative deviations.
The PoM mentions target/indicator 11.1: The absence of a negative trend in the number of days in a year exceeding specific fixed level of impulsive noise (dB) per 20 * 20 nautical miles (can also be determined by water bodies) in Estonian coastal waters. This can be associated to target 28 above.

New measure M016 focuses on the establishment of a registry of impulsive sounds. This is very much in line with target 28. However, targets 2 and 29 are not covered by the new measure. It can be argued that the existing (1a and 1b) measures contribute to target 2 as it will most likely work towards the protection of marine life. However, target 29, dealing with continuous low frequency sounds is not specifically covered, except, potentially, through very general measures about SEA and EIA. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses environmental targets.";GES has not been defined yet, hence no conclusion can be made on the achievement of GES. The measures partially address targets.

EL ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Greece identified NIS introductions as a relevant pressure on its marine environment, pointing to aquaculture and shipping as activities which contribute to the introduction and spread of NIS in its waters. Aquaculture and shipping are directly addressed by the reported measures, including ballast water management and restrictions on the use of certain species for aquaculture. Biofouling on vessels, however, does not seem to be addressed. It is also likely that Greece’s PoM addresses tourism, as well as professional and amateur fishing through information programmes. It therefore partially addresses the pressures relevant for D2 since, despite directly covering shipping and aquaculture, there is still some uncertainty as to whether or not biofouling on vessels is covered by the measures.

At the subregional level in the Adriatic Sea, all Member States reported aquaculture and shipping as causes of NIS introduction. In the Aegean-Levantine Sea, shipping is mentioned by both Member States (Greece and Cyprus). In the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, aquaculture and shipping, as well as tourism and recreation, including yachting, are identified as relevant activities by the neighbouring Member States. While Greece did not report this last activity as relevant for D2, some of the measures included in its PoM might indirectly cover tourism/recreation.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s priorities is to monitor the spread of invasive species: ‘Non‐indigenous species introduced by human activities are, to the maximum extent possible, at levels that do not adversely alter the ecosystem’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators). Greece’s measures contribute to addressing this issue.";The measures partially address introductions of NIS.

EL ;MED ;13;D3 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Greece reported the pressure ‘extraction of species, fish and shellfish’ as relevant for its marine waters (Adriatic Sea, Ionian and Central Mediterranean Sea, and Aegean-Levantine Sea), listing the activities of fisheries (including recreational fishing) and, more specifically, vessels larger than 12m with mobile gears, as contributors to the pressure. Greece’s PoM addresses these activities. Recreational fisheries are addressed by two measures. The PoM thus addresses the reported pressures and activities.
  
At the subregional level, all neighbouring countries also identified fisheries as an underlying cause of the pressure ‘extraction of species’. Malta also pointed to vessels larger than 12m with mobile gears which may affect the seabed (i.e. trawlers). 

At the regional level, UNEP/MAP has defined an ecological objective for commercially-exploited fish: ‘Populations of selected commercially exploited fish and shellfish are within safe biological limits, exhibiting a population age and size distribution that is indicative of a healthy stock’  (with associated operational objectives and indicators). Commercial fishing is one of the main human activities responsible for the extraction of species.

EL ;MED ;13;D3 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"GES, as defined by Greece, relates to fishing pressure (mortality) and spawning stock biomass (SSB). 
Since the Total Allowable Catch and quota management mechanisms of the CFP are not used in the Mediterranean Sea, the reported measures address fishing effort via spatio-temporal, minimum landing sizes and gear restrictions. However, it is likely that some overall reduction of fishing effort is also necessary to completely achieve sustainable exploitation levels, which does not appear to be included in the PoM. There is no mention of national stocks in the PoM, although these are likely to be addressed by the reported measures tackling temporal, spatial or gear restrictions (such as ‘Implementation of technical measures regulating fishing gear’, ‘Fishing restrictions in five Artificial Reefs’, ‘Banning specific fishing gear and practices’), CFP data collection schemes (such as ‘Implementation of the National Programme for Fisheries Data Collection’, and minimum size of the catch (such as ‘Determination of minimum size for 55 commercial species’).

Greece’s targets relate to the same criteria as their GES determination (fishing mortality and SSB). The reported measures address the targets, including fishing restrictions (gear or spatio-temporal restrictions). As in the case of the GES, targets to contain the pressure of fishing activity would be more effective if they address the fishing effort of the fleet as a whole.

EL ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Greece stated that aquaculture, industry, agriculture, and urban waste water discharge represent the main sources of nutrients in its marine waters. The reported measures, both the general measures (not focusing on a specific activity) and those directed at specific activities, address the pressures and activities reported by Greece for D5. Good operating practices and monitoring are established for aquaculture activities through a dedicated new measure. Agricultural practices are extensively addressed through three existing measures, all of which relate to the implementation of the Nitrates Directive. Cross-cutting existing and new measures planned or already carried out under the WFD and the UWWT Directives address industry and urban activities.  

At the subregional level, the activities identified by Greece as the main contributors to nutrient enrichment in its marine waters correspond to those reported by the other Member States in the subregions. It can therefore be concluded that Greece’s recognition and reporting of eutrophication activities broadly addresses the same activities as the neighbouring Member States. 

At the regional level, UNEP/MAP identified pollution from land-based sources, urbanisation of coastal areas and mass tourism as sources of nutrient enrichment in the Mediterranean Sea. Greece’s measures are likely to tackle these pressures and activities in its waters.";The reported measures, both the general measures (not focusing on a specific activity) and those directed at specific activities, address the key activities causing nutrient enrichment identified in Greece’s Article 8 reporting, i.e. aquaculture, industry, agriculture and urban waste water discharge. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/49ab027b-8dd7-468a-a4f2-64dd7da37530/details
EL ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Under Article 9, Greece stated that its marine environment will be considered to have achieved GES when the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the water column are at levels which do not accelerate primary production, and the direct and indirect impacts of elevated nutrient levels are minimised/eliminated. Greece further specifies GES by defining fixed thresholds for nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a levels, Secchi depth, toxic algal status, and dissolved oxygen concentration/saturation.

All of the D5-specific measures are concerned with reduction of nutrient loads into the marine environment, and the D5 GES definition is concerned with achieving either nutrient level thresholds in the marine environment or minimising the direct and indirect impacts of elevated nutrient levels. Therefore, the measures reported in the PoM address the GES definition for D5.

Greece defined two targets for D5:
•	Reduction in nutrients and organic matter loads entering the marine environment from point and diffuse sources. 
•	Reduction in nitrate pollution caused by agricultural activities, by using good agricultural practice to reduce the amounts of nutrients entering coastal waters. 

Both targets are concerned with a reduction in nutrient loading into the marine environment, particularly from agricultural sources, and are thus closely linked to the GES definition presented above. All existing and new direct measures aim to decrease nutrient export from land, with four specifically targeting agricultural activities as a nutrient source. Thus, the targets defined for D5 are addressed by the PoM. ";The measures address the D5 GES and target definitions. New and existing measures aim to decrease nutrient export from land to the sea to minimise the direct and indirect impacts of elevated nutrient levels on the marine environment, which is in line with the GES and target definitions. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/49ab027b-8dd7-468a-a4f2-64dd7da37530/details

EL ;MED ;13;D7;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Greece’s Article 8 report, the main sources of hydrographical changes are desalination, industry, agriculture and forestry, and coastal defence, as well as urban waste water discharge. Two measures reported for D7, EL_D7_EX_01 and EL_D7_NE_02, address warm/salt water discharges into coastal areas. Discharges from desalination plants are highly concentrated brine solutions (and, depending on the type of desalination plant, sometimes also have elevated temperatures), which influence coastal water quality in terms of the salinity profile, and warm water impacts (influencing density), and in turn oxygen solubility and availability. These may have negative impacts on benthic as well as pelagic habitats are. According to clarification provided by the Member State, the two new cross-cutting measures EL_D7_NE_01 and EL_D7_NE_03, which target waste water (from a broad set of activities), and various offshore projects respectively, cover the other relevant activities identified by Greece. For each of the listed activities, measures to protect the marine environment from hydrographical changes will be developed. According to clarification from Greece, this will be related to environmental licensing and the implementation of an electronic register for better impact assessment. Given the lack of detail provided in the measures’ descriptions, there is still some uncertainties on whether and how discharges from activities such as agriculture or industry are covered; therefore, the PoM partially addresses the pressures.

At the subregional level, Cyprus, the other Member State in the Aegean-Levantine subregion, refers to industrial activities, desalination and coastal defence but also to port operations. In the Adriatic Sea and Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, only Slovenia and Malta also report hydrographical changes as a relevant pressure (due to land claim/coastal defence and port operations for Slovenia, and dredging, desalination (locally), industry, land claim/coastal defence and port operations for Malta). These activities are likely to be covered by Greece’s measures.

By definition, the measures reported cover all pressures, as all projects which could adversely impact hydrological conditions are subject to the existing regulatory procedures. They thus address the pressures identified by UNEP/MAP as relevant for D7 (urbanisation of coastal areas, land reclamation, etc.).";The measures partially address the relevant pressures and activities reported under Greece’s Article 8 (i.e. desalination, industry, agriculture and forestry, and coastal defence, as well as urban waste water discharge). While most of these activities are covered by the reported measures, there is still uncertainty regarding other relevant activities that may be covered through two new cross-cutting measures (e.g. agriculture or industry). In the absence of detailed information on these cross-cutting measures, the extent to which all relevant pressures and activities are addressed by the PoM is unclear. The addressing of cumulative impacts is similarly unclear.  ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/49ab027b-8dd7-468a-a4f2-64dd7da37530/details
EL ;MED ;13;D7;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Greece’s GES definition for D7 permits permanent changes to hydrographical conditions where the impacts do not adversely affect marine ecosystems. This definition appears to be modelled after the definition provided by the MSFD and remains at this very general level. The PoM covers several activities identified by Greece as altering hydrographical conditions, preventing possible long-term effects of the pressures on ecosystems. It thus addresses the GES definition for D7. 

Greece has reported one target for D7, the prevention of environmental impact of permanent alterations in hydrographical conditions caused by local human activities. In addition, several indicators are provided, although not further described in terms of thresholds, time or spatial scales. As explained above, the existing measures reported only address a sub-set of relevant activities, mostly those related to the discharge of heat or salt into the marine environment. Even though, new measures reported in the PoM mainly aim to improve the effectiveness of the existing measures by updating regulations or providing guidance, they do cover additional activities such as coastal or dredging projects.

EL ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Greece identified the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds as an issue for its waters, pointing to marine hydrocarbon extraction, industry, agriculture, aquaculture, shipping and urban activities as underlying causes of these pressures in all three subregions. It also reported marine mining as a source of hazardous compounds in the Aegean-Levantine Sea. Some of these activities are covered by specific measures. Agriculture, aquaculture and urban activities are likely to be covered by WFD-related measures. Marine mining does not seem to be covered by any measure, although it is not clear whether or not this is a relevant activity in Greece, even though it has been reported in Article 8. Greece’s Article 8 report also identified shipping as a source of accidental pollution. Shipping is covered by existing and new measures reported for D8. In addition to the activities identified under Article 8, Greece also includes fisheries and port operations in its measures. The PoM thus partially addresses the reported pressures and activities.

At the subregional level in the Adriatic Sea, the majority of the Member States reported industry, shipping and urban activities as sources of hazardous compounds. In the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, neighbouring Member States highlighted aquaculture, industry and urban activities. In the Aegean-Levantine Sea, Cyprus also reported industry, agriculture, urban activities and shipping as sources of hazardous compounds. Greece covers these activities in its PoM. In all subregions, shipping has been particularly noted as the activity responsible for accidental pollution, and this is covered by Greece in its PoM.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is associated with contaminants: ‘Contaminants cause no significant impact on coastal and marine ecosystems and human health’ (with associated operational objectives and indicators). Greece, therefore, contributes to meeting this objective.";The measures partially address the reported pressures and activities. For the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, marine hydrocarbon extraction, industry, agriculture, aquaculture, shipping and urban activities are covered either by measures specifically addressing these activities or by general measures. However, marine mining (reported in Article 8) does not seem to be covered by any measure. For acute pollution events, Greece’s PoM addresses shipping, as well as marine hydrocarbon extraction, fisheries and port operations. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/49ab027b-8dd7-468a-a4f2-64dd7da37530/details
EL ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Greece’s GES definition for D8 aims to gradually reduce the concentrations of hazardous substances and restrict their adverse impacts to ensure no major risks will ensue. The definition is further divided in two. The first part explains that hazardous substances should be kept at low levels and ultimately reach background values or zero. Therefore, the concentrations and impacts of hazardous substances are evaluated according to threshold values (limit reference points) suggested. The second part lists the concentration of contaminants in seabed habitat/biota.
Risks and impacts of pollution are likely to be covered by measures focusing on the implementation of various policies and targeting specific human activities. However, the lack of detail about Greece’s measures creates uncertainty about whether or not the impacts of pollution are fully covered, and the biological effects of contaminants are fully addressed. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the GES definition for D8.

Greece defined one target for D8: investigation of impacts and determination of dominant trends of contaminant concentrations in the water column, sediments, marine organisms and ecosystems.

GES is however not achieved in areas adjacent to industrial zones, although the implementation of various EU policies after EU accession has significantly reduced chemical pollution in areas defined as hot spots in the 1970s.

EL ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Greece identified marine litter as a pressure on its marine waters, due to fisheries (including recreational fishing), urban activities, tourism and recreational activities (including yachting), and shipping. The measures reported address these activities, with additional issues also covered (such as port operations and solid waste disposal). Existing measures address litter coming from land-based sources and help reducing beach litter by regular and voluntary clean-up actions/campaigns. New measures include actions to reduce litter from sea-based sources as well, including shipping, fisheries and tourism. By covering both land-based and sea-based sources of marine litter, Greece addresses the pressures and activities reported in Article 8. Greece did not identify the pressure of micro-plastics (and related activities) in its Article 8, despite general agreement that this issue (and its different sources) is a pressure on all European waters. However, one new measure - investment in projects aimed at reducing micro-waste entering the environment from sewage systems - specifically addresses micro-litter.

At the subregional level in the Adriatic Sea, the majority of the Member States report urban activities as the main source of marine litter, while most of the Member States of the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea point to tourism/recreational activities, shipping and fisheries. In the Aegean-Levantine subregion, Cyprus has identified not only tourism/recreational activities, shipping and fisheries, but industrial and urban activities as well. The measures reported by Greece address these activities.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives concerns litter: ‘Marine and coastal litter do not adversely affect coastal and marine environment’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators). UNEP/MAP also published a report on the assessment of marine litter in the Mediterranean Sea, in which it acknowledges that this pressure constitutes a serious threat for the marine environment and is due to densely populated coasts (urban activities), well-developed tourism and the passage of 30% of global maritime traffic (shipping). These human activities thus represent some of the main sources of marine litter in the Mediterranean Sea. The report also mentions the growing concern about micro-plastics. These activities, including micro-plastics, are covered by the Greek measures although the PoM does not refer to UNEP/MAP regional plan for marine litter, which is a significant gap in the PoM.";The measures address the reported pressures and cover the reported activities. The existing and new measures reported by Greece cover both land-based and sea-based sources of litter: fisheries, urban activities, tourism/recreational activities, shipping, as well as additional activities such as industry.

EL ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets;"The definition of GES for D10 is: ‘To achieve GES according to D10, it is desirable to reduce the quantities of marine litter in the coastal and marine environment to such an extent that they do not harm the environment or the organisms living in or depending on it. In the long-term, it is desirable to have totally litter-free coasts and seas. However, by 2020 the aim is to have achieved an important reduction in the amount of litter present’.
Greece has identified the following target as relevant for D10: ‘Reduction in litter of anthropogenic origin from the coastal and marine environment’.

The measures aim to reduce the amount of marine litter entering the marine environment from land-based (e.g. cleaning of beaches and riverbeds, in collaboration with local government) and sea-based sources (e.g. promotion of projects to improve port reception facilities for ship-generated waste).

The two new measures directly aim to reduce noise in the marine environment from three different sources, while the existing measure will serve as an indicator of the effectiveness of the new measures. Also, respectively all measures and the new measures have been linked to ACCOBAMS and IMO MEPC.1/Circ.833 (Guidelines for the Reduction of Underwater Noise from Commercial Shipping to Address Adverse Impacts on Marine Life). Therefore, the GES definition (in terms of managing human activities, impacts and low frequency sound) is considered as addressed, although uncertainties remain due to a lack of details regarding the description of the measures.

Greece has reported one environmental target: control of energy levels and noise so that they do not adversely affect the marine environment. The reported target is vague, as neither the type of noise nor the components of the marine environment affected are specified.

ES ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Spain identifies NIS introductions as a pressure in all five of its marine subdivisions. It highlights mostly shipping, fisheries and aquaculture activities as contributing to the spread of these species in the Bay of Biscay, Macaronesia and Western Mediterranean marine subregions. Spain also reports tourism/recreational activities as contributing to the spread of NIS in the Western Mediterranean marine subregion. Spain mentions solid waste disposal in its Article 8, but it is not clear what the Member State means by reporting this activity for this pressure (Spain is the only Member State that highlights this activity for NIS (D2)). This activity has not been considered for this assessment. 

Spain has reported measures dealing with aquaculture. The existing measure relates to Council Regulation (EC) No 708/2007 of 11 June 2007 but Spain has not provided information concerning specific actions or measures to meet the obligations of this regulation. Instead, it simply refers to the implementation of the regulation as a means of addressing the pressure. Concerning the new measures, this assessment considers that only four of the new measures reported by Spain as relevant to NIS introductions from aquaculture actually address this pressure. Measure EAl2 deals with the early detection and rapid eradication of NIS in at-risk areas such as ports and aquaculture areas, and should therefore directly address the pressure of NIS introductions. Measure EAI1 concerns improving knowledge on NIS which can indirectly lead to a better approach to addressing the pressure of NIS introductions through aquaculture. New measure H13 relates to supporting the development of the aquaculture sector through supporting innovation and entrepreneurship; these activities might indirectly help to address or prevent issues with NIS introductions through aquaculture activities. In addition to the existing and new measures specific to D2, Spain has reported an existing horizontal measure that addresses aquaculture and is related to D2, the M374 multi-annual Strategic Plan for Spanish Aquaculture 2014-2020.
In relation to shipping, five existing measures, one existing but not yet implemented measure and one new measure directly address NIS introductions by shipping activities. Measures M340 and M341 relate to guidance on the prevention of the spread of NIS through shipping by ballast water (M340) and fouling (M341 for the Mediterranean Sea, M343 for all regions). Measure M338 reports on the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments. Measure M339 refers to the UNEP/MAP Action Plan on the introduction of species and invasive species in the Mediterranean. Measure M342 refers to the UNEP / MAP Guide for risk analysis on the assessment of the impacts of introduction of non-indigenous species (2008) in the Mediterranean. Finally, measure M346 refers to the EU Strategy on invasive species (environmental policy) which includes prevention of NIS introductions through trade, as well as the early detection and eradication of NIS and actions to control and maintain established NIS. The new measures reported by Spain focus on increasing knowledge related to NIS (EAI1) or the rapid detection and eradication of NIS (EAI2).
For fisheries, Spain reports one new measure (BIO46) that addresses this activity. This measure concerns the development of guidelines on artificial reefs. Artificial reefs are used in Spain to enhance fishing resources. Nevertheless, they could give rise to a number of negative impacts, including creating habitats for invasive species to thrive in. The measure will update existing guidelines of where and how to set up these reefs in order to minimise negative impacts, including those from NIS. It will thus have a direct impact on NIS introduction.  
Lastly, tourism is addressed by one existing measure (M341), but in a very general manner that also targets other activities. Overall, Spain’s PoM addresses the relevant pressure and activities through a set of existing and new measures which directly or indirectly impact the marine environment. 

At the subregional level, in both cases (NEA and the Western Mediterranean), neighbouring Member States report NIS as a pressure. In the NEA, France and Portugal report aquaculture and shipping (France also reports tourism in the Bay of Biscay), while in the Western Mediterranean, France and Italy report fisheries, aquaculture, tourism and shipping as vectors of NIS. All these activities have been covered by the Spanish measures. 

At the regional level, in the Mediterranean Sea, UNEP/MAP’s priority is monitoring the spread of invasive species, with the objective of maintaining NIS introduced by human activities at levels that do not adversely alter the ecosystem. Both monitoring and controlling NIS are covered by Spain’s PoM. UNEP/MAP identifies shipping as the main source of NIS, and this activity is addressed by Spain’s PoM. In the Atlantic region, OSPAR identifies aquaculture, shipping and fishing as the main sources of NIS and has defined a list of NIS in the region. Spain has identified aquaculture and shipping as sources of NIS in this region, but not fishing.";The PoM addresses the pressure of introduction of NIS and relevant activities including aquaculture, fisheries and shipping (ballast water and bio-fouling). Spain has defined existing and new measures that target these activities.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/5d9d245e-2e94-4972-b335-b7ed783383db/details
ES ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The Spanish GES definition covers two aspects of NIS: the impact of NIS on biodiversity and native habitats, and the risk of NIS becoming established and spreading. As part of its NIS definition, Spain singles out the impact of non-indigenous macroalgae on native biota. 

Spain’s PoM has several measures that focus on the removal and/or eradication of NIS, covering both animal species such as mice, rats and mink (particularly on islands), as well as vegetation to protect or restore habitats (e.g. M353, M284). Spain does not specifically mention a marine NIS which is aimed to be eradicated through its measures. For the second part of the GES definition (addressing the establishment and spread of NIS) the PoM addresses activities that facilitate the spread of NIS (e.g. shipping), and includes monitoring of NIS to prevent new introductions, as well as rapid eradication. Spain’s PoM therefore addresses all components of the GES definition.

Spain has reported four targets as part of its Article 10 reporting (A1.2, A1.3, A1.5 and C3.6), each of which is addressed by its PoM. The targets deal with minimising introductions and the secondary expansion of NIS, NIS eradication, and improving knowledge on the presence, distribution, abundance and impacts of NIS. All of these aspects are addressed by various measures focused on regulating activities that act as NIS vectors (e.g. M340), on the rapid eradication of NIS (e.g. EAI3) and improving knowledge concerning NIS (e.g. M351).";The PoM addresses the GES and targets, as they cover controlling, monitoring, rapid detection and eradication of NIS and improving knowledge of NIS. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/5d9d245e-2e94-4972-b335-b7ed783383db/details

Based on this assessment, the competent authorities proposed new measures, which aim to support the achievement of GES. Nevertheless, no clear timelines are reported on whether or not GES is expected to be achieved by 2020.

ES ;MED ;13;D3 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting Spain identified fisheries - including recreational fishing - as a relevant factor for the pressure ‘extraction of species’ (fish and shellfish) in each of the relevant subdivisions. Additionally, it has reported seaweed harvesting as a relevant activity for the pressure ‘extraction of species’ (fish and shellfish) in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast, and the Western Mediterranean. Commercial fisheries are addressed in all regions through existing and new measures related to the CFP (e.g. M186, M333) and ICCAT (e.g. M488, M489), as well as local and national management measures (e.g. M195). Non-CFP stocks, including shellfish, are also addressed by various local/national measures. Recreational fisheries are addressed through the Royal Decree regulating recreational sea fishing in offshore waters (M197), the multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna (M180), regulation of activities in marine reserves (M174 and M175), recreational fishing legislation with an autonomous scope (M497) and by new measure BIO18 which modifies Royal Decree 347/2011 of 11 March regulating recreational marine fishing in international waters. Seaweed harvesting is addressed in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast by measure M205, but not in the Mediterranean where it was also indicated as relevant. 

In the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, Spain, France and Portugal all reported fisheries - including recreational fishing - as a relevant activity for the pressure ‘extraction of species’ (fish and shellfish). Only Spain has reported the activity ‘Seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting’ as relevant. In Macaronesia, both Spain and Portugal have reported fisheries, including recreational fishing, as relevant. Finally, in the Mediterranean, Spain, France and Italy all report fisheries - including recreational fishing - as a relevant activity for the pressure ‘extraction of species. Only Spain has reported ‘Seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting’ as a relevant activity related to this pressure. It is unclear if this activity is relevant in the Mediterranean, as Spain excludes it from the PoM. 

At a regional level, Spain refers to the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) GFCM and ICCAT. Also, it refers to several OSPAR recommendations and one UNEP/MAP Action Plan for protecting vulnerable species.

For example, ICCAT regulations are included in the following measures: 
•	M488 – recovery plan for bluefin tuna in Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, recommendation for management measures for Mediterranean swordfish.
•	M491 – ICCAT recommendations on research.
•	M489 – ICCAT recommendations for species recovery plans (blue marlin and white marlin, albacore).
•	M490 – regulation of fishing activity relative to sustainable conservation and exploitation of certain species – catch limits and temporary closures, including catch documentation programmes, catch control standards, reducing juvenile catches and discards of swordfish.

GFCM-related measures include: 
•	Fishing exclusion zones for recovery of fish stocks (M483), also mentions coordination with UNEP-MAP on protected areas.
•	Exploitation of red coral (M492).
•	Measures on mesh size (within M199).";The PoM partially addresses the activities of commercial and recreational fisheries, as well as seaweed harvesting in all Spanish subdivisions except the Western Mediterranean ones. CFP stocks and national/local (non-CFP) stocks are addressed through the measures, and both commercial and recreational fisheries are included in the measures. Harvesting of algae (Bay of Biscay and Macaronesia subregions) and of red coral (in the two Western Mediterranean subdivisions) are also included. However, given the state of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean, it is not clear whether the management measures represent a sufficient departure from the status quo to address the problem.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/5d9d245e-2e94-4972-b335-b7ed783383db/details
ES ;MED ;13;D3 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The GES components of fishing mortality (F) and spawning stock biomass (SSB) are addressed by Spain’s PoM through the various measures under the CFP, national legislation and regional (GFCM, OSPAR, UNEP/MAP) and international (ICCAT) measures. The PoM addresses not only CFP stocks but also non-CFP stocks and shellfish through various national measures. The Spanish PoM will contribute to achieve or maintain GES. 

Spain reported 12 targets as relevant to Descriptor 3 as part of its Article 10 reporting; however, not all of these targets are necessarily relevant to Descriptor 3 (A1.5, A1.6 C.1.1, C1.2). The measures relevant to D3 address size distribution, the large fish indicator, distribution and range, exploitation of stocks within safe biological limits and improved data collection. Each of these targets is addressed by the PoM. Size distribution and the large fish indicator are addressed through mesh size restrictions (e.g. M199) and minimum sizes for certain fish species (M198), as well as some measures related to marine reserves, which can offer protection for large size individuals of certain species. Targets A3.4 and C1.6 related to exploiting stocks within safe biological limits are addressed by the numerous existing measures that relate to the CFP and associated regulations, international (ICCAT) regulations, regional (GFCM) regulations and regulations for local/national stocks. Measure EC1 related to the decommissioning of fishing vessels for the purpose of reducing fleet excess capacity should also facilitate the exploitation of stocks within safe biological limits. Target C3.7 relating to the improved data collection of commercially exploited stocks in relation to GES is addressed by various measures, including BIO19 updating the current fisheries Electronic Logbook, BIO20 focusing on studies on specific artisanal fisheries, EC5 on improving cooperation between scientists and fishermen, and H5 ACTIONMED supporting integrated regional monitoring programmes. Lastly, target A3.4 on the distribution and range of species should also be addressed by the PoM for commercially exploited species through the various management measures even though this target is not addressed by any specific measure.

ES ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Spain, the main sources of eutrophication of its marine waters are urban discharge, aquaculture and industry (all subdivisions), agriculture (all except Macaronesia), and fisheries (the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic). 
Spain’s existing measures predominantly tackle the export of nutrients from urban and agricultural sources. Very few of these measures tackle aquaculture and industrial emissions of nutrients, and none tackle fishing. Nevertheless, under Article 8 Spain specified that aquaculture is an activity in its waters that causes important nutrient inputs. The Member State reports that it has implemented a multi-annual strategic plan for aquaculture, under which it addresses the issue directly but also indirectly by aiming to develop sustainable aquaculture methods. Furthermore, transport (terrestrial, shipping and aircraft) is covered to some extent through commitments under the Barcelona Convention. Spain’s new measures tackle urban and industrial emissions of nutrients but are likely to achieve only relatively minor reductions in nutrient export to sea, since the existing measures would have tackled the bulk of the problem. In Macaronesia, industry is likely to be addressed by measure CONT4. The contribution of fisheries activities to nutrient enrichment in the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic subdivisions does not appear to have been addressed and its importance as a nutrient source remains unclear. 
At the subregional level, in the Bay of Biscay, neighbouring Member States (France and Portugal) mainly report agriculture (although France also reports other activities such as industry, aquaculture and urban activities) as sources of nutrients. In Macaronesia, Portugal reports agriculture as the primary cause of eutrophication. In the Western Mediterranean, the neighbouring Member States mainly refer to agriculture, forestry, industry, recreational and urban uses as the primary causes of eutrophication. These activities are addressed by Spain’s PoM.
Spain’s measures are likely to tackle the pressures identified by OSPAR (urban discharges, agriculture and industry) and UNEP/MAP as relevant for D5 (pollution from land-based sources, urbanisation of coastal areas, mass tourism, etc.).";"The PoM addresses nutrient emissions from urban, aquaculture, industry and agricultural sources – presumably via implementations of the UWWTD and Nitrates Directive. However, fishing activities and their contribution to eutrophication do not seem to be fully addressed; and there is no mention of other related urban nutrient-related activities. Overall, the major nutrient sources have been tackled but there may still be some scope for further improvements and coverage of additional relevant human activities. Therefore, the D5 PoM partially addresses the relevant pressures and activities. ";2;Partially addresed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/5d9d245e-2e94-4972-b335-b7ed783383db/details
ES ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Spain defines GES as no increase in nutrient and chlorophyll levels in all of its marine waters, although a chlorophyll threshold is provided only for waters in the Levantine-Balearic marine area. Similarly, for all of its waters, it appears to commit to no changes in macrophyte communities attributable to nutrient enrichment (although this is not entirely clear for its Atlantic waters), and sets a dissolved oxygen saturation threshold in all of its marine subdivisions. For the North Atlantic subdivision, it also includes a clause on no changes in phytoplankton community composition. GES is therefore defined in terms of nutrient enrichment, together with its direct and indirect effects, and is presumed to be achieved in all subdivisions. 

Spain’s measures with direct effects for D5 are all concerned with reducing nutrient and organic emissions to the sea through tackling specific sources. Spain acknowledges that different activities contribute at different levels to the nutrient (and organic) pressure in individual subdivisions, but thresholds rather than trends - at least for nutrients - would have been useful to assess the achievement of GES, particularly in light of the level of variability in marine environmental data. Nutrient emissions can only be reduced so far, and a genuine ‘no change’ in status over a six-year period is as likely to be recorded as a declining trend as it is an increasing trend, even though Spain has tackled D5 relatively robustly.

When it comes to the Spanish environmental targets, direct and indirect discharges of nutrients are likely to be tackled, thereby reducing the volume of inadequately treated emissions (and nutrient/organic load) to the marine environment in all subdivisions (Target B1.1). However, based on the information presented, it cannot be determined whether any trend of increasing nutrient levels within the North Atlantic subdivision has been reduced or reversed (Target B1.3). Neither can it be determined if the OSPAR nutrient threshold values for certain areas within the South Atlantic subdivision are exceeded (Target B1.3); nor those of the other subdivisions (Target B1.3). Nevertheless, the reductions in nutrient emissions brought about by the measures will most likely assist in reaching these targets. In addition, reduced terrestrial nutrient emissions are likely to assist in achieving Target B1.4. For Target B3.1 (quantification of the impact of atmospheric deposition), the new measure AH1 appears to be particularly relevant. ";The PoM addresses all relevant components of GES and targets. However, with GES defined in terms of trends rather than thresholds, its achievement may prove difficult to determine, given hydrological/environmental variability. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/5d9d245e-2e94-4972-b335-b7ed783383db/details

ES ;MED ;13;D7;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Spain’s identified pressures under Article 8, the main source of hydrographical changes is the interference with hydrological processes caused by port operations (in Bay of Biscay and Western Mediterranean subregions), urban waste water discharge (all subdivisions), desalination and water abstraction (Canary, Levantine-Balearic and Strait of Gibraltar and Alboran), industry and land claim/coastal defence (Levantine-Balearic marine area and Strait of Gibraltar and Alboran, although industry could potentially be considered in the other subdivisions through thermal power stations, this information is less clear). Marine acidification is not reported as a source of hydrographical changes. The measures reported by Spain address all pressures reported for the marine subdivisions. The general measures relate to the implementation of EIA and SEA procedures, as well as the development of criteria to assess the compatibility of projects with marine strategies, and are likely to allow for the addressing of most pressures related to D7 (all works and activities likely to cause hydrological changes). In fact, the PoM goes beyond the pressures and activities reported as, in principle, these would be covered by the existing regulatory procedures for the authorisation of projects. No clear measure about desalination in the Mediterranean Sea has been reported (only Macaronesia is covered). No reference is made to cumulative impacts. 

At the subregional level, in the Bay of Biscay, neighbouring Member States mainly report land claim/coastal defence (France also mentions other activities such as industry, agriculture and aquaculture, while Portugal reports port operations and thermal power stations) as sources of changes in hydrological processes. In Macaronesia, Portugal reports land claim/coastal defence, and port operations as the primary causes of hydrographical changes (as well as thermal power stations). In the Western Mediterranean region, the neighbouring Member State (only France since Italy does not report hydrographical changes as relevant in its marine waters) mainly reports industry, agriculture and land claim/coastal defence as the primary causes of hydrographical changes. These activities are addressed by Spain’s PoM through the existing regulatory procedures for the authorisation of projects.

For the same reason, Spain’s measures also address the pressures relevant for D7 identified by OSPAR - related to the offshore economy - or in the Second State of the Mediterranean Marine and Coastal Environment Report (SoER-MED), and by UNEP/MAP (urbanisation of coastal areas, land reclamation, etc.).";The measures reported by Spain address all pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting, as well as the relevant pressures identified by OSPAR and UNEP/MAP. Only one aspect is not fully addressed in the Mediterranean Sea. By definition, the reported measures address all pressures since all projects which could adversely impact hydrological conditions are subject to the existing regulatory procedures. Nevertheless, no clear measure about desalination in the Mediterranean Sea has been reported. Therefore, the measures address the pressures and reported activities in the Atlantic region and partially address the pressures and reported activities in the Mediterranean region. Cumulative impacts are not explicitly referenced and it is not clear how or if they are addressed. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/5d9d245e-2e94-4972-b335-b7ed783383db/details
ES ;MED ;13;D7;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The Spanish definition of GES for all subdivisions, which is general and not at indicator level, admits only local changes in small areas that do not cause irreversible damage to biogenic or protected habitats. In addition, it provides that marine habitats should evolve in accordance with the prevailing climate conditions. The measures reported by Spain for D7 cover human activities likely to provoke permanent changes and therefore fully address the Spanish GES definition. They address all of the parameters, pressures, areas and habitats included in this definition, including the reference to hydrographical changes related to climate changes.

Spain defined six environmental targets for D7, common to all subdivisions: the proportion of the area affected (C.2.1); the effects for the achievement of GES of biogenic and/or protected habitats (C.2.2); the compatibility of changes with habitat conservation (C.2.3); the EIA for projects (C.2.4); ecological flows and their effects on marine ecosystems (C.2.5); and surveillance for hydrographical changes and ocean hydrodynamics (C.3.9). No link is provided between the measures and the targets. Nevertheless, the analysis of the measures reported shows that most of the targets (C2.1, C2.2, C2.3, C2.4, C2.5) are addressed through local/specific actions (as mentioned above, a full list is provided) and in general through the adaptation of EIA to take into account hydrographical changes within the environmental assessment regulatory procedures. However, no information is provided about the way in which cumulative impacts will be addressed. Concerning target C 3.9, the measure reported for this target (AH1) addresses it but covers only two of the subdivisions despite being relevant for all subdivisions. In spite of these reservations (cumulative impacts, coverage), the measures can be said to address the environmental targets for D7.";The measures address the Spanish definition of GES as they cover all of the relevant parameters, pressures, areas and habitats included in the definition, including the reference to hydrographical changes related to climate change.

ES ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"Spain reports four types of D8-related pressures in its marine waters. According to its Article 8 reporting, in the Bay of Biscay (North and South Atlantic) and Western Mediterranean Sea (Strait of Gibraltar, Alboran, Levantine-Balearic), the pressure associated with the introduction of synthetic compounds is due to industry, urban activities, port operations, shipping and agriculture, while in Macaronesia (Canary Islands), port operations, urban activities and shipping are responsible for this pressure. The pressure ‘introduction of non-synthetic compounds’ is reported to be caused by industry, urban activities, shipping and port operations in the Bay of Biscay (North and South Atlantic) and Western Mediterranean Sea (Strait of Gibraltar, Alboran, Levantine-Balearic), with port operations, urban activities and shipping responsible for this pressure in Macaronesia (Canary Islands). For these two pressures (introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds), the Member State also mentions dredging/solid waste disposal (including dredge material) as source of pollution. However, it is possible that this activity and port operations are combined. The introduction of radio-nuclides is only reported in the Western Mediterranean Sea (Strait of Gibraltar, Alboran, Levantine-Balearic). Still, Spain also explains that the contamination by radionuclides is estimated as practically non-existent. Finally, Spain reports industry, shipping and port operations as responsible for accidental pollution in the Bay of Biscay (North and South Atlantic), with port operation and shipping responsible for this pressure in Macaronesia (Canary Islands), as well as marine hydrocarbon extraction, industry, port operations and shipping in the Western Mediterranean Sea (Strait of Gibraltar, Alboran, Levantine-Balearic).
Therefore, Spain addresses all pressures and activities through its measures. It defines measures for each of these pressures and activities, with the exception of accidental pollution by industry. However, industrial activities are likely to be covered by some measures that address various activities (this is the case for M251 and CONT7). The PoM also addresses additional activities such as dredging, fishing and tourism.

At the subregional level, in the Bay of Biscay (North and South Atlantic) and Macaronesia (canary), neighbouring Member States did not always report the same activities causing these pressures: France reported various activities as sources of hazardous compounds (industry, agriculture, urban activities, port operations, shipping, solid waste disposal (including dredge material) and the dumping of munitions). France also reported accidental pollution due to the dumping of munitions and shipping. Portugal reported the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds due to shipping, while it reports marine hydrocarbon extraction as source of accidental pollution. In the Western Mediterranean Sea, Italy reports industry and offshore structures as sources of hazardous compounds (Italy does not report accidental pollution as relevant). France reported the same pressures and activities as those mentioned in the North and South Atlantic subdivisions. Spain’s PoM covers most of these activities.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is associated with contaminants: ‘Contaminants cause no significant impact on coastal and marine ecosystems and human health’ (with operational objectives and indicators). OSPAR’s objective for D8 is to ‘prevent pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions, and losses of hazardous substances, with the aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances’. The Spanish measures focus on both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, and target several human activities and topics that contribute to the release of these compounds. Therefore, Spain, through its D8-related PoM, contributes to meeting these aims.";The PoM addresses the reported pressures and activities in all Spanish marine subdivisions (introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds due to industry, agriculture, urban, port operations and shipping, and accidental pollution due to industry, port operations, shipping and marine hydrocarbon extraction). Radio-nuclides compounds are also covered although estimated as practically non-existent by the Member State. The PoM also targets additional activities such as dredging, fishing or tourism.;3;Addresed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/5d9d245e-2e94-4972-b335-b7ed783383db/details
ES ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Spain defined eight targets applicable to all its marine subdivisions, except the Canary (seven targets). 

The measures address point and diffuse pollution including atmospheric deposition and acute pollution events. D8 targets are to ensure that concentrations of hazardous substances in biota do not exceed “levels of pollutants in biota established by the competent authorities and by international bodies"". This implies that at least the EU’s Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) Directives (2008/105/EC, or as amended by 2013/39/EU) should be followed. These Directives are cited in some of the measures (i.e. MM269-SUD, BIO36, CONT4 and CONT5, the later three cover all five sub-regions). Another target for Spain is to have decreasing trends (or stable levels if the concentrations are low) that are assessed in sampling both biota and sediment.

Two targets focus on the reduction of wastewater discharges. Management of wastewater discharges and reducing related pollution is the focus of several measures such as M266, M282, M289 and CONT4, thus addressing these targets.
Spain also defined a target about the reduction in acute pollution events, which is also addressed by several existing (more than 18 of their measures listed under KTM32) and new measures (CONT1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -12, and -13). 
Spain also addresses the sources of contamination as a target. Several existing (e.g. M223, M232, M233, M240, M244 and M286) and new measures (CONT1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -12, and -13) aim to reduce the loads of hazardous substance via the atmosphere or via rivers. In addition, Spain has measures to address emissions from offshore installations of the North Atlantic subdivision (M236 and M237) and shipping (M239, M242 (in the Mediterranean only), M246 and M248). 
Spain also defined targets on filling knowledge gaps about marine pollution and its impacts. Spain reports several measures that have an indirect impact on the D8-related pressures, and address these targets. More specifically, four existing measures (M308, M299, M260, M336), two existing but not yet implemented measures (M281, M292), one new measure (H13) and one completely new measure (CONT14) address the target and will contribute to filling knowledge gaps.

GES, directly linked to the targets, is also addressed by the reported measures. It should be noted, that no GES is defined for Macaronesia. ";The PoM addresses GES and target definitions.

ES ;MED ;13;D9;Coverage of pressures ;"
Spain reports the introduction of hazardous compounds, including through accidental pollution as relevant for its marine waters. According to its Article 8 reporting, in the Bay of Biscay (North and South Atlantic) and Western Mediterranean Sea (Strait of Gibraltar, Alboran, Levantine-Balearic), this pressure is caused by industry, agriculture, shipping, marine hydrocarbon extraction, urban activities, and port operations, while, in Macaronesia (Canary Islands), port operations, urban activities and shipping are stated to be responsible.  

Spain’s D9 measures are similar to those of D8. Indeed, all but one of the measures listed above are also relevant for D8. The single D9-specific measure (M355) seems to cover various activities and aims to ensure good quality of seafood. Therefore, Spain addresses all pressures and activities through its measures. The PoM also targets additional activities such as dredging, fishing and tourism.

ES ;MED ;13;D9;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Spain defines two targets for D9: no exceedance, for any species intended for human consumption, of the maximum allowed content (MAC) established in the Community legislation or any other requirements for the protection of human health (i.e. Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006), as well as ensuring traceability of the fisheries products in order to use the information obtained at different official controls in the evaluation of GES regarding pollutants in the fisheries products. Spain does not define temporal trends as a target. 

The D8 and D9 PoM designed by Spain (in combination with the Spanish Monitoring Programmes for D8 and D9 reported in 2014) addresses the targets. The measures target a variety of sources of different types of contaminants entering the marine environment, linking to OSPAR and UNEP/MAP actions, as well as EU regulations (e.g. REACH) among many other actions all of which will indirectly contribute in reducing the level of contaminants that is found in biota, including seafood. The D9 specific measure M355 focuses on the implementation of a National Plan for the Official Control of the Food Chain, which has been created to comply with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and control the food chain to comply with rules on feed, food and animal health/welfare. It describes, under the principle of transparency of public administrations, official control activities to be carried out along the entire food chain, from primary production to points of sale to the final consumer.

ES ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"Spain reports marine litter as a pressure in all of its subdivisions under Article 8 (North and South Atlantic (Bay of Biscay), Strait of Gibraltar and Alboran, Levantine-Balearic (Western Mediterranean Sea) and Macaronesia (Canary Islands)) and highlights various contributing sources to marine litter for each subdivision. In all subdivisions, Spain reports urban activities, fisheries, shipping and tourism/recreational activities as the main human activities responsible for marine litter (Spain does not explicitly report tourism in Bay of Biscay, but it is likely that the shipping activity also includes recreational shipping). In Bay of Biscay, Spain also reports aquaculture. The Member State has established several measures to address macro and micro litter from all relevant human activities, as well as more general measures which will tackle the problem indirectly (awareness raising efforts, training and education, beach clean-up campaigns, studies to increase knowledge in some aspects of marine litter where there are still knowledge gaps, such as impacts on microliter on marine organisms). The PoM is extensive and therefore addresses pressures and human activities in all subdivisions.

At subregional level in the Western Mediterranean Sea, the main activities reported by France and Italy as responsible for marine litter are urban activities, tourism/recreational activities, shipping and fisheries. Spain covers these activities through the reported measures. In Bay of Biscay, the main activities reported by France are fisheries, urban activities, shipping, aquaculture, tourism/recreation, industry and port operations. Portugal mentions marine litter in its Article 8 (in Bay of Biscay and Macaronesia) but does not associate it with specific activities. The Spanish PoM for marine litter addresses the pressure and activities reported by the neighbouring Member States. 

At the regional level, Spain’s PoM refers, where relevant, to the OSPAR regional action plan (e.g. BM18, CONT5) and the regional action plan for the marine litter management in the Mediterranean (UNEP/MAP) (e.g. BM17, BM18, H5), showing an RSC-level coordination effort. ";The PoM addresses the relevant pressures. In its Article 8, Spain has reported marine litter as a pressure in all of its subdivisions, with varying causes identified as contributing sources (fisheries, shipping, tourism, aquaculture and urban activities). Spain has identified measures addressing both the reported pressure and activities, as well as more general measures (awareness raising, training and education, beach clean-ups). The PoM addresses the relevant pressures and activities and it also covers other activities (such as port operations) and micro-litter. Few existing measures also mention OSPAR’s and UNEP/MAP’s Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/5d9d245e-2e94-4972-b335-b7ed783383db/details
ES ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets;"GES has been defined by Spain as ‘The quantity of marine litter, including its degradation products, ashore and in the marine environment decreases (or is reduced) with time and is at a level that does not cause damage to the marine and coastal environment’. Spain has not defined associated indicators for GES, but the targets and its associated indicators are all connected to the GES definition. The measures address the two geographical areas (coastal and offshore areas) as mentioned in the GES definition as well as micro-litter (and the degradation products). The reported measures cover the GES definition. However, doubts exist as to the extent to which ‘not cause damage’ can be assessed within the PoM.  

Spain identifies seven targets across all of its subdivisions. The code given to a specific target depends on the subdivision to which it is assigned. However, the targets assigned are generally the same, with the exception of B.1.8/B.1.9 which are valid only for the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast – North (target number: B.1.9) and South sub-division (target number: B.1.8). Targets B.1.6/B. 1.7 and B.1.7/B.1.8 do not concern Macaronesia. In general, the targets relate to the reduction of marine litter on the coastline, beaches and continental shelf, the reduction or no increase in the quantity of marine litter derived from fisheries, improvement of knowledge on the characteristics and impacts of marine litter, and an increase in knowledge of the effect of human activities on habitats. As Spain has identified measures addressing both marine litter in general (i.e. through awareness, education, beach clean-ups), and specifically within fisheries, shipping, tourism and urban activities, its PoM addresses the defined targets. More specifically, all new measures that specifically link to marine litter (BM code), are clearly described and associated with the pressure marine litter and the targets of marine litter as stated above. Some of them are addressing maritime sources of marine litter like fisheries (BM3, BM5, BM7, BM18, BM23), aquaculture (BM3, BM7), ports/shipping (BM1, BM5, BM6). They will all contribute to the targets focused on reducing litter at the beach and on the seabed (B1.4/1.5, B1.5/B1.6, B1.6/B1.7, B1.7/B1.8, B1.8/ B1.9). Other measures address land-based activities such as for example the recycling industry (BM9) and will also help to reduce marine litter. Some new measures (BM11, BM13, BM14, BM21, BM25, BM26) will also enhance the knowledge on marine litter including marine litter hot spots, contributions of different sources, macro and microplastics. They should help identify possible measures to reduce litter at its source in the future. These measures are linked to target B3.3. The other new measures reported as relevant for D10 will help decreasing the pressure associated with marine litter but, the description of each one of these measures does not clearly link them to a specific D10 target. Overall, the PoM addresses the GES and targets definitions.";The PoM addresses the GES and target definitions. Spain presents a comprehensive PoM, covering fisheries, shipping, tourism and urban activities for example. The new D10-specific measures can all be directly linked to the targets.

ES ;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"In its five marine subdivisions (Bay of Biscay (North and South Atlantic), Macaronesia (Canary Islands), and Western Mediterranean Sea (Strait of Gibraltar, Alboran, Levantine-Balearic)), Spain reports underwater noise as a pressure, pointing to especially fisheries and shipping as the activities responsible. Other activities are mentioned in Spain’s Article 8 as potential sources of underwater noise: port operations, recreational shipping, submarine cables and pipelines, extraction activities /solid waste disposal, marine research and marine hydrocarbon extraction. Spain’s PoM addresses the reported pressures but only partially addresses the reported activities. While measures have been defined for shipping, recreational shipping, sub-marine cables and research, only one completely new measure relates to fisheries, among other activities, and even that only has an indirect effect on the pressure. No measure has been defined addressing marine hydrocarbon extraction, port operations and extraction activities /solid waste disposal.

At the subregional level in Bay of Biscay and Macaronesia (Canary Islands), only France also reports underwater noise as a pressure due to shipping, offshore activities, research, defence operations and the extraction of materials. Portugal does not. Spain addresses most of these activities. In the Western Mediterranean Sea, most of the Member States report marine research and shipping as responsible for underwater noise in their marine waters, and Spain addresses these activities as well.

At the regional level, one of UNEP / MAP’s objectives is associated with energy and noise: ‘Noise from human activities causes no significant impact on marine and coastal ecosystems’. Spain’s PoM contributes to addressing this aim.";The PoM partially addresses the reported pressures and activities. Shipping (both commercial and recreational), sub-marine cables/pipelines and research are the focus of several measures, but fisheries is only addressed by a measure that has an indirect effect on the pressure (its aim is to raise awareness).

ES ;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The Spanish GES definition for D11 is very broad: ‘The impulsive noise of high, medium and low frequency and continuous low frequency noise introduced in the marine environment by human activities have no adverse effects on the marine ecosystems’. It is somewhat in line with the D11 definition and includes the two main noise sources as identified by the MSFD (impulsive and continuous sound). Generally speaking, Spain’s PoM addresses GES for D11 (for example with M330, M359 and M325). However, some measures directly aimed at D11 focus on gathering information and knowledge transfer (indirect measures, such as M360 and M58) instead of managing the impacts of noise. Several regional measures do not directly target D11 but can indirectly affect noise (e.g. M356 and the traffic separation schemes, M317 on regulations for observation of cetaceans, etc.).

Spain defined two targets for D11. B.1.10 aims to prevent significant impacts of underwater noise on the marine environment. This target is rather a broad objective but implies management measures to ensure that noise levels are kept at or below the accepted level. B.3.4 focuses on improving knowledge of underwater noise and other energy inputs into the marine environment, as well as on their impacts on marine biodiversity. It is a very ‘soft’ target that can be achieved via information campaigns or background papers. Several existing and new measures reported for D11 address target B.3.4, such as MM360, M364, M365, M156, RS1 and H11.

While Finland is likely to address the pressure through existing measures, the information provided is insufficient to conclude this with certainty. The activity explicitly specified by Finland is shipping. Therefore, the measures partially address D2 pressures.

Neighbouring Member States have identified shipping as key pathways of NIS introductions. Finland broadly addresses this activity causing the pressure.

At the regional level, neighbouring Member States have identified shipping and aquaculture as key pathways of NIS introduction. HELCOM identifies NIS as a pressure on the Baltic Sea, with the most important vectors being aquaculture, recreational activities/tourism, port activities (industrial and ferry), shipping and mooring/anchoring all contributing to the input or spread of NIS. As above, apart from shipping, it is not clear what other relevant activities are addressed.";The measures partially address the key pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting.

FI ;BAL ;13;D3 ;Coverage of pressures ;"The pressure extraction of species, caused by fishing activities will be covered by all existing measures. Measures FISH 1 and FISH 2 will indirectly address the pressure (M011-FISH, M012-FISH). 

Under Article 8, all Baltic Sea Member States, including Finland, identified fisheries including recreational fishing (fish & shellfish) as a relevant activity causing the pressure ‘extraction of species - fish & shellfish’. Finland addresses this pressure (commercial and recreational fishing activities) through its existing and indirectly through its new measures, thus this pressure is addressed for both commercial and recreational fisheries. 

At the regional level, one of HELCOM’s action areas relates to fisheries. HELCOM acknowledges the fact that fishing can have an adverse effect on the marine environment (stocks for example). Indeed, fishing concerns both commercial and non-commercial stocks and bottom trawling may damage species such as thin-shelled bivalves and starfish.

It is not clear whether age/size structure is adequately addressed for other relevant species, either by CFP measures or additional national legislation. The three aspects of GES appear to be adequately covered for coastal and nationally important species, with various existing measures in place for sea trout, salmon and eel, respectively. 

Finland’s D3 targets are Target 3 which aims to protect marine species, including fish; Target 5, which aims to achieve a sustainable use of marine resources; and Target 6, which aims to implement MSP in Finnish waters to manage human activities and reduce harmful effects. The existing measures address all targets. The implementation of the CFP (measures relating to F and SSB for the species managed under total allowable catches (TACs), such as herring, sprat and cod) address Targets 3 and 5. Target 6 is addressed by a number of measures that specifically relate to the use of marine environment (hunting, fishing, aquaculture, etc.). ";The measures address the D3 GES and targets, as they link to the CFP and address fishing mortality (F), spawning stock biomass (SSB) and age/size distribution of coastal species.

Finland applies Article 14(1)(e) (‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’) to D3. Finland believes that the D3 measures are overall adequate to achieve sustainable fishing of the main commercial fish species covered by CFP quotas, such as herring, sprat and cod. In addition, sustainable levels of salmon will be achieved by 2020. However, it states that the achievement of GES for sea trout, pike, perch and other migratory whitefish species will be delayed because the effects of measures addressing these species will result in measurable changes at a later stage due to a time-lag in fish life-cycles (life-span and maturation). This assessment finds the justification to be grounded, as indeed time-lags for biomass of fish species to increase are likely to delay the achievement of GES.

FI ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"There are additional measures not directly targeting any particular pressure or activity but, rather, focused on the improvement of marine habitats, communication activities and others; these were not included in the table above. 

According to Finland’s initial assessment, eutrophication of its marine waters is caused by the input of nutrients and organic matter originating mainly from agriculture/forestry, urban discharges and industry. The reported measures address the pressures identified in its Article 8 reporting for D5, through the implementation of relevant EU Directives; through actions that are in line with the Baltic Sea Action Plan under the Helsinki Convention; and the adoption of new pressure-specific measures, targeting agriculture, aquaculture (mariculture) and shipping.

The measures also intend to target NOx emissions from ships (M007-EUTRO and M008-EUTRO). 

At the subregional level, for the Baltic Sea, nutrient enrichment is identified as a pressure by all of the neighbouring Member States. The key human activities reported as relevant subregionally mirror those reported by Finland, i.e. agriculture/forestry and urban areas. All of these are addressed in Finland’s PoM. 

At regional level, HELCOM identifies land-based activities (agriculture and forestry, urban areas, industry, aquaculture, transport and energy production) and sea-based activities (shipping and aquaculture). These are addressed by the Finnish PoM. ";The measures address all key pressures and activities identified in their Article 8 reporting – agriculture/forestry, urban areas and industry – and link to other pieces of EU legislation that are relevant to tackling eutrophication.

FI ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"In accordance with the Finnish definition, GES for D5 is achieved when the quantity and concentrations of nutrients and organic substances that end up in the sea due to human activities are at a level that does not cause direct or indirect harmful impacts to the marine environment. The GES definition refers specifically to water transparency, algal blooms, natural relationships between species and habitats, depth distributions and the concentrations of oxygen. All of these are either nutrient concentrations themselves, or direct/indirect indicators of the effects of changing nutrient levels. Finland has reported measures aimed at both reducing nutrient inputs to the marine environment (the large majority of the measures) and at mitigating the impacts of eutrophication (M004-EUTRO). They should therefore be able to address the GES definition, although internal loading of nutrients from sediment in the sea will almost certainly lengthen the time to achieve GES (this is indirectly addressed through M006-EUTRO).

Finland reported two targets for D5, of which one aims to reduce impacts of eutrophication on the marine environment and the second to implement MSP to reduce environmental impacts. Both targets are addressed by the reported measures. The measures reported by Finland are primarily concerned with reducing nutrient loads to the sea (and refer directly to the WFD and HELCOM), thereby reducing concentrations in the sea itself, and their impact(s). The targets are all concerned with reducing nutrient loads/concentrations in line with legislation and agreements currently in place.  By including NOx emissions from ships, Finland tackles an additional source of nutrient pollution. Furthermore, Finland reports Targets 3 and 4 as being indirectly relevant for D5. The targets link to protection of species and habitats and to the reduction of shipping impacts. These aspects are primarily addressed in the framework of D8 and D1, 4, 6.

FI ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Timelines ;"Timeline to achieve GES
Finland acknowledges that it is not likely that GES for D5 will be achieved by 2020, mainly due to the slow recovery of the Baltic Sea from historic nutrient and organic-enrichment. Finland estimates that it will be possible to achieve GES in certain areas of the Archipelago Sea by 2021 (which is beyond the required MSFD timeline of achieving GES by 2020), while in most parts of the Archipelago Sea, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia, achieving GES will be postponed until 2027.

Timeline for implementation of the PoM
Several of the reported measures under D5 are existing measures. All new measures will start to be implemented by 2016, one of them will be implemented until 2019, another one until 2025, and all others until 2021. The implementation period of a last new measure is ‘open’ without further details.";New measures are in place as of 2016, and while GES is not expected to be achieved by 2020, a grounded justification has been provided.;0;No conclusions ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/f4148616-5e09-44b9-ac1d-2b503a48bae0/details
FI ;BAL ;14;D5 ;Exceptions ;"Finland applies one exception for D5. It applies exception type Article 14(1)(e) (‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’). It acknowledges that it will not be possible to achieve the load reduction targets in Finland’s marine waters by 2020. This is a major exception, since its definition of GES refers to numerous impacts of elevated nutrient levels, and it is not clear whether thresholds for these are expected to be achieved.  

Finland states that a significant reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loads is expected, but in coastal waters this will not be sufficient to achieve the reduction targets. It justifies this delay by referring to a lag period between the implementation of measures to reduce nutrient emissions and observable positive effects in terms of reduced nutrient loads to and/or concentrations within the marine environment. Furthermore, it highlights that a major fraction of nutrient enrichment results from historically contaminated seabed sediments, which recover slowly. Finland states that phosphorus in particular has been stored in seabed sediments and will be released to the water column for a long time.

This assessment finds that the justification provided by Finland is grounded. Historically-enriched sediment may continue to be a net source of nutrients for decades after nutrient loads to both fresh and marine surface waters have been reduced, therefore it is reasonable for Finland to indicate that the benefits of measures undertaken in 2010 are not yet fully realised. The same would apply to deeper sediments in the Baltic.

It should be noted that the Member State does not specify when GES is expected to be achieved as per MSFD requirements (in relation to Article 14(1)(e)).

FI ;BAL ;13;D7;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Finland in its Article 8, the main sources of hydrographical changes are interference with hydrological processes and marine acidification. However, it has not pointed to specific human activities as the causes of pressure. The measures address the pressures reported in Article 8. There are three additional measures not directly targeting a particular pressure or activity but, rather, focused on improving local flow conditions in coastal areas, conservation measures and communication activities; these were not included in table 11.

The majority of Member States in the Baltic Sea reports the (disturbance of) hydrological processes as a pressure on their marine environment. In general, the human activities reported as relevant subregionally are renewable energy generation, industry, land claim/coastal defence, port operations, placement and operation of offshore structures, tourism/recreational activities, shipping, solid waste disposal and other marine uses and activities (all Member States report different activities associated to this pressure). Half of the Member States in the Baltic Sea also report marine acidification as a pressure on their marine environment, naming industry, agriculture/forestry, shipping and other uses as contributory factors. The reported measures address most of these activities. 

The measures reported cover all pressures since all projects which could adversely impact hydrological conditions are subject to the existing regulatory procedures (e.g. measures that link to EIA and SEA Directives). They thus also address the pressures identified by HELCOM and relevant for D7. With regard to acidification, HELCOM recognises the lack of knowledge in this area but notes that the acidification of the Baltic Sea has not progressed alarmingly.

Natural conditions are mentioned and Estonia further clarified that  Art.14 (1)(e) ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’ has been used. Estonia reports that the achievement of environmental targets is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the implementation of the PoM for the Water Management Plan 2015-2021. The specificities of the Baltic Sea should be taken into account: a very closed basin and the accumulation of contaminants in sediments. Due to the lack of knowledge about the contaminants in the marine environment exceeding the EQS (their origin, spread, and biogeochemical processes releasing them from the sediments), it is not possible to define targeted measures to control the pressure. Therefore, it is very likely that GES, for all contaminants, will not be achieved by 2020, especially due to natural conditions in the Baltic Sea. In order to clarify the problem and implement possible measures, a number of studies have been proposed that would need to be carried out in the near future (including geological studies in the Estonian marine area). The environmental targets for managing environmental pollution risk (including monitoring and pollution response) under D8 can be achieved by implementing the measures defined under the Interior Security Development Plan and measures in this PoM. Sufficient anti-pollution capability is ensured in cooperation with neighbouring countries.

It explains that GES is not completely achievable by the end of 2020, because of the slow degradation of several substances in the natural environment and the slow organic purification process taking place. As such, some compounds are expected to remain in nature for a long time, affecting its achievement of GES for pollutants. 

The concentration of dioxins and PCBs is high in large herring, Baltic salmon, sea trout and lamprey in all Finnish marine areas, especially in the Gulf of Bothnia for dioxins and in the Gulf of Finland for PCBs. Finland also highlights that it was granted an exception from the regulation EC/ 2375/2001 for the dioxin levels in its commercial fish species. This exception allows fish to be marketed in Finland even if their dioxin concentrations exceed the maximum limit for commercial fish as set out by the directive.

Furthermore, Finland states that the main sources of dioxins and PCBs are currently located mainly outside of Finland (hence the use of Article 14(1)(a)), as Finland states to be responsible for only 12% of dioxin concentrations in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, dioxin and PCB contamination from the Kymijoki river is considered a non-negligible source, this is due to historically contaminated seabed sediments and not current industrial activities. 

Finland states that considering current data, it is not possible to define dates for achieving GES. The applied exception relates to the timeline by which GES will be achieved (in this case beyond the deadline of 2020) and not to the full achievement of GES in the future. 

This assessment finds the justification provided for the application of exceptions grounded. ";Finland applied an exception for D9, based on Article 14(1)(a) ( ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’) and Article 14(1)(e) ( ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’), stating that GES will not be achieved by 2020 given the presence of persistent pollutants still found in high concentrations in sediments and biota, namely dioxins and PCBs. The sources of these are identified as being past pollution events in Finland and continuing pollution from other countries in the Baltic Sea (transboundary pollution). Current pollution from Finland is addressed through the D8/D9 measures. This assessment finds the justification provided by Finland for the exception applied as grounded. Nevertheless, the Member State does not specify when GES is expected to be achieved as per MSFD requirements (in relation to Article 14(1)(e)), due to data gaps.;3;Grounded ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/f4148616-5e09-44b9-ac1d-2b503a48bae0/details

Shipping waste is addressed by existing legislation, as well as by an indirect new measure (M029-INFO/C.2 raising awareness regarding shipping in protected and sensitive areas). In addition, the existing measures and one of the new indirect measures (M013-LITT) also target micro-litter, which has not been reported as a relevant pressure by Finland, despite its significant presence in the Baltic Sea. Finland therefore addresses the reported pressure and activities. It also covers shipping and micro-litter.. 

Neighbouring Member States have mainly identified tourism/recreational activities as source of litter. This is the case for Estonia and Sweden, for example, both of which also report shipping as a relevant human activity contributing to the pressure. Finland covers this activity through its reported measures.

At the regional level, Finland’s measures for D10 will contribute to HELCOM’s regional action plan on litter, as evidenced by its planned actions under the new measure M013-LITT.

FI ;BAL ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The GES for D10 states that marine litter properties and quantities should cause no harm to the marine environment. It thus refers to both macro- and micro-litter at sea and on the beach. GES has been formulated with descriptions related to chemical and physical harm to ecosystems and to the recreational use of the marine environment, and explicitly states that it may not lead to negative economic impacts on the marine industry. These aspects will be addressed by the existing measures, which aim to reduce waste, from shipping but also from waste packaging and other, non-specified activities. Finland proposes the new measure M013-LITT to consider these aspects. However, M013-LITT is set up as a survey to set targets and measures for reducing litter in the marine environment (or in other words to develop a PoM) and could not be considered as a concrete measure in itself. Its last phase however plans to define and implement measures. The existing measures and indirect new measure M029-INFO will contribute to achieving GES, but not all aspects of GES (e.g. chemical harm, micro-litter) are covered by these measures. 

Finland defines two targets for D10. Target 6, refers to the implementation of MSP. This target will be addressed through the implementation the Marine Spatial Planning Directive (Directive 2014/89/EU), as mentioned in the Finnish PoM.

Another indirect measure (i.e. M015-NOISE) also concerns offshore structures. Therefore, the measures partially address the reported pressures and activities.

It should be noted that Finland also refers to heat as an additional local pressure. It is not clear from which source this is from and where is it located. No measures seem to address heat.

Neighbouring Member States have mainly identified shipping as source of noise. Finland covers this activity in its reported measures.

At the regional level, noise is one of HELCOM’s action areas.

FI ;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Finland’s GES definition follows the D11 MSFD descriptor. The indicator 11.1 mentions both impulse and continuous sound and can thus be seen as incorporating both original MSFD indicators (Com decision 2010). Indicator 11.2 refers to temperature changes. Finland reports five measures, of which three are specific for noise. In general, the three ‘noise-specific’ measures address Finland’s GES definition, as they include construction and shipping noise which can be seen as impulse and continuous sources, respectively. All of these measures can be seen as first steps in any management of noise-related impacts (as required by the Finnish GES definition and targets) but do not go beyond that. The IMO guidelines on which M014 is based on are non-binding, M016 is very unspecific and it can be assumed that it will help in the further identification of pressures from shipping noise. M015 is quite comprehensive but it is not clear how much marine construction will take place in Finnish waters in the coming years. The measures do not address the part of the GES definition dealing with heat impacts and heat discharge. 

Finland reports two targets as relevant for D11. Target 6 aims to implement national and regionally coherent MSP plans to reduce harmful effects of human activities. This target is addressed through the implementation of the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (Directive 2014/89/EU). Furthermore, Finland links Target 4 indirectly to D11. This target aims to reduce harmful effects of shipping on marine species, including underwater noise. This target is addressed through the D11 measures.

It states that commercial fisheries are addressed by four measures (010-MED1a, 020-MED1a, 039-MED2, M008-NAT1b) and recreational fisheries by one measure (021-MED1a). Commercial fishing is regulated under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) (covered by measure 010-MED1a). Measure 020-MED1a includes the promotion of more selective fishing techniques and 008-Nat1b includes developing new practices to limit impacts on the marine environment (discards, bycatch, habitat impacts). However, the assessment concludes that it is unclear whether the management measures will be sufficient to address the pressure caused by commercial and recreational fishing. A number of fish stocks in the Mediterranean are significantly impacted by current fishing activities and the reported measures do not seem to go significantly beyond current measures to reduce the pressure and improve environmental conditions. Overall, measures do not seem to focus on controlling recreational fishing in the Mediterranean as, other than regulations for swordfish and tuna fisheries, recreational fishing is not subject to any register of practitioners, licences, or catch reporting. France limits only catches along the Corsica coastline. Although measure 039-MED2 will implement restrictions on both commercial and recreational fishing, it only addresses some of the most overexploited stocks.

FR ;ATL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"According to France’s initial assessment (Article 8), eutrophication of its marine waters is due to aquaculture, industry, agriculture, urban activities and shipping in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay, and due to industry, agriculture and shipping for the Celtic Seas. France has extensive PoMs with measures targeting industrial, agricultural and urban activities. France has clarified that shipping (relevant in all subregions) is addressed by measures reported for D8 which address targets D8-3, D8-4, for the reduction of contaminants including nitrogen. Nevertheless, aquaculture (relevant in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay) is not fully addressed by the D5 measures. As such, the measures partially address relevant pressures and activities.

At the subregional level, in all three subregions of the NEA, Member States concerned have consistently identified nutrient enrichment as a relevant pressure. In the Greater North Sea, nutrient enrichment is highlighted by all of the neighbouring Member States, which mainly report urban, agricultural and industrial activities as the relevant human activities. In the Celtic Seas, all Member States report industry and agriculture (Ireland and the UK both also report urban activities). In Bay of Biscay, the main reported activity responsible for nutrient is agriculture (more precisely, Spain also reports aquaculture, industry and urban activities, while Portugal reports only agriculture). With the exception of aquaculture, all human activities mentioned – agriculture, urban areas and industry – are specifically addressed by the French PoMs. 

At regional level, OSPAR refers mainly to the impacts of eutrophication, making a comparison with regional pressures and priorities impossible in the context of this descriptor. Eutrophication, as a result of nutrient enrichment, is a specific work area of OSPAR. According to the RSC, nutrient inputs contributing to eutrophication can come from point sources (such as industries) and diffuse sources (such as agriculture or households not connected to sewage systems). ";The measures partially address the pressures and activities reported by France under Article 8. They address the pressure associated with nutrient enrichment.

FR ;ATL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"In accordance with the French definition common to all four subregions, GES for D5 is achieved when the biological community is balanced and retains all of the necessary functions in the absence of adverse disturbances associated with eutrophication (e.g. excessive phytoplankton development, low oxygen concentrations, etc.) and when there is no impact from excessive water enrichment by nutrients on the sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services. The French GES for D5 thus refers to direct/indirect indicators of the effects of changing nutrient levels. As a result, given that the measures reported aim to reduce nutrient inputs to the marine environment and that these should minimise the adverse effects of eutrophication, they should therefore address the GES definition. 

North East Atlantic

France reported two environmental targets for D5 for the NEA subregions. Each target has further two operational targets associated to it (for a total of six operational targets). One target concerns the conservation of areas with little or no impact from eutrophication. The two operational targets aim to limit nutrient inputs and identify areas of eutrophication and watersheds that contribute the most to the major nutrient inputs. The other target concerns the reduction of excessive nutrient inputs in the marine environment. The two operational targets focus on various sources of nutrient, including agriculture, urban areas and industry, and also refer to the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen inputs through air pollution plans. The reported measures address the targets as they cover relevant sources of introduction of nutrients from agriculture, urban areas and industry. Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen to the sea from shipping is addressed by D8 measures. Nevertheless, aquaculture does not appear to be addressed.  

In addition, the spatial protection measure reported addressing eutrophication does not concern the Greater North Sea, Bay of Biscay or Celtic Seas, to which the target concerning the conservation of areas with little or no impact from eutrophication applies.

FR ;ATL ;13;D7 ;Coverage of pressures ;"According to its Article 8 reporting, France reports the interference with hydrological processes as relevant in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay. In the Celtic Seas, France states that interference with hydrological processes is either localised or non-existent. In the North Sea and Bay of Biscay, France reports aquaculture, industry, agriculture, land claim/coastal defence as having an impact on hydrological processes. Industrial activities especially refer to changes in thermal regimes due to discharges from powerplants. France addresses these activities through its measures in the NEA. Aquaculture is likely to be covered by the horizontal measures.  Therefore, the measures address the pressures.

At the subregional level, for the North Sea, interference with hydrological processes is mentioned by all relevant Member States, with the exception of Sweden. They name various activities as responsible for it and the most reported one is land claim and coastal defence. For the Bay of Biscay, the neighbouring Member States acknowledge interference with hydrological processes as a pressure, mainly referring to port operations as the contributing human activities. For the Celtic Seas, the Member States also mention various activities such as renewable energy, land claim and coastal defence, or port operations (the UK and Ireland report different activities for this pressure). The measures reported by France explicitly address pressures in the watershed, while specific activities such as wind farms and wind energy projects, and trawling are not explicitly addressed but would be covered by the existing regulatory regimes. 

By definition, the measures reported cover all pressures, as all projects which could adversely impact hydrological conditions are subject to the existing regulatory procedures. They thus also address the pressures identified by OSPAR on the offshore economy and relevant for D7.

Likewise, the PoMs do not address all relevant targets.

Industry, agriculture, urban, port operations, the dumping of munitions, shipping and solid waste disposal have been reported by France as activities responsible for the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay. In the Celtic Seas, France reports industry, urban and shipping as activities leading to the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. France also reports dumping of munitions and shipping as sources of accidental pollution in all marine subregions in the NEA. The existing and new measures address the reported activities.  Dumping of munitions is covered by the general measures which address several activities at the same time.  Therefore, the measures address the pressures and reported activities.

France has clarified that radio-nuclides are addressed outside the framework of the MSFD, and hence not reported in the PoMs.

At the subregional level, other Member States have identified the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds as relevant pressures. They mainly report industry and shipping for synthetic compounds, as well as industry, shipping, agriculture and urban activities for non-synthetic compounds as key sources of contaminants. They also mainly report shipping as the key source of accidental pollution. In the Celtic Seas, they point to these four pressures. Industry has been considered the main cause of introduction of synthetic compounds (although Ireland also reports urban activities and the UK also mentions shipping). Industry and shipping are the most reported activities for the introduction of non-synthetic compounds, while shipping seems to be the main source of accidental pollution. In the Bay of Biscay, shipping has been reported by all three Member States as a source of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds (Spain also reported other various activities).  In the case of accidental pollution, none of the Member States report the same pressure related activity. Spain mentions industry, shipping and port operations, while Portugal highlights marine hydrocarbon extraction. France’s measures for the NEA subregions tackle almost all these activities. 

At the regional level, the French measures for D8 are in line with OSPAR’s objective of ‘preventing pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions, and losses of hazardous substances, with the aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances’. Indeed, the measures focus on both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. They target several human activities and topics that contribute to the release of these compounds in the NEA.

Dumping of munitions is likely to be covered by the general measures which address several activities at the same time.

The GES definition is associated with two criteria and three indicators. Even though the measures will indirectly impact these indicators, GES is partially addressed by the measures. There is no clear link between the French targets (see below) and the GES definition (especially its indicators).

North East Atlantic 
France defines one general target for all subregions (reducing or eliminating the input of chemical contaminants to the marine environment, whether chronic or accidental) that has been developed in six sub-targets. They focus on the direct inputs or transfer of contaminants into the sea due to careening areas, dredging and shipping activities, the atmospheric input of marine-based and land-based contaminants, the land-based inputs of contaminants from industrial, urban and agricultural origin, and the transfer of contaminants to the marine environment. 

The measures, taken together, address the above targets. This is primarily accomplished by the focus on shipping, dredging, discharges and emissions inter alia through compliance with EU, OSPAR, and MARPOL Directives and agreements. France also has a number of control measures to reduce the risk of acute pollution events (accidental pollution), such as measure M234-NAT1a. Examples include:
•	Measures M232-NAT1a, M404-ATL1a or M013-NAT2 can address the sub-target related to direct inputs of contaminants into the sea from careening areas.
•	Measures M233-NAT1a, M305-MMN1a or M024-NAT1b can address the sub-target related to direct inputs of contaminants into the sea from dredging activities.
•	Measure M236-NAT1a can address the sub-target related to direct inputs of contaminants into the sea from shipping activities.
•	Measure M236-NAT1a also concerns the sub-target on atmospheric input of marine-based contaminants.
•	Measure M302-MMN1b covers the sub-target related to atmospheric input of land-based contaminants.
•	Measures M240-NAT1a and M237-NAT1a address the sub-target on land-based inputs of contaminants from industrial, urban and agricultural origin, and the transfer of contaminants to the marine environment.";The measures address the D8 targets but not the GES. So GES and targets are partially addressed. The measures are likely to control and reduce the input of a number of hazardous substances into the marine environment from several sources of pollution.

France defines two general targets that focus on the chemical contaminants from watersheds (target F) and the discharges of hydrocarbons and other pollutants from ships (Target H). Target F is ‘divided’ into five sub-targets (rainwater from coastal towns and municipalities (F1) and from industrial facilities and ports (F2), waste water systems of towns (F3), direct discharges or offshore discharges from areas of ship repair and maintenance (F4), input of major rivers and coastal streams (F5, MARPOL)). Target H includes six sub-targets (aerial surveillance and satellite detection of illegal discharge (H1), collection devices in ports (H2), pollution from potentially dangerous wrecks (H3), prevention and control mechanisms (H4), international cooperation and joint plans (H5), enforcement of marine pollution between France, Spain and Italy (H6)). 

The measures, taken together, address the above targets. This is primarily accomplished by addressing shipping, dredging, discharges and emissions through, for example, compliance with EU and MARPOL Directives and agreements. France also has a number of control measures to reduce the risk of acute pollution events (accidental pollution), such as measures M040-MED1a to M043-MED1a.";The measures address the D8 targets but not the GES. So GES and targets are partially addressed. The measures are likely to control and reduce the input of a number of hazardous substances into the marine environment from several sources of pollution.

Industry, agriculture, urban, port operations, solid waste disposal, shipping and the dumping of munition are the responsible activities in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay. In the Celtic Seas, France reports industry, urban and shipping. The measures proposed by France for D9 address this pressure and focus on many of these human activities, except solid waste disposal, shipping and the dumping of munitions. However, solid waste disposal, shipping and dumping of munitions are covered by D8 measures. Therefore, the D9measures, combined with those of D8, address the pressures. 

France has clarified that radio-nuclides are addressed outside the framework of the MSFD, and hence not reported in the PoMs. 

At the subregional level, in the North Sea, other Member States have identified the introduction of hazardous compounds as a relevant pressure. They mainly report industry, shipping, agriculture and urban activities as a key source of pollution. In the Celtic Seas, industry and shipping have been reported by all three Member States (Ireland, UK and France). In the Bay of Biscay, Spain and Portugal report the introduction of hazardous compounds as relevant and due to shipping (although Spain also reports industry, agriculture, urban and port operation). France’s D9 measures tackles almost all of these activities. 

At the regional level, the French PoMs for D9, together with the D8 PoMs, is in line with OSPAR’s objective of ‘preventing pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions, and losses of hazardous substances, with the aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances’. Indeed, the measures focus on diverse types of compounds. They also target several human activities and topics that contribute to the release of these compounds in the NEA.

The existing and new measures address this pressure and cover several activities as presented in the above table except solid waste disposal and the dumping of munitions. However, solid waste disposal and dumping of munitions are covered by D8 measures. France also refers to shipwrecks in its Article 8 as a potential source of contaminants. France reports a specific measure in the Western Mediterranean Sea subregion targeting shipwrecks (M041-MED1a). Therefore, the measures address the pressure.

At the subregional level, industry has been reported as a responsible activity by all neighbouring Member States (although Spain also reports agriculture, urban activities, port operations and shipping as relevant sources of hazardous compounds). France’s measures tackle these activities.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is related to the contaminants: ‘Contaminants cause no significant impact on coastal and marine ecosystems and human health’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators). Therefore, France, through its D9 and D8 measures, contributes to meeting this objective in the Mediterranean region.

FR ;ATL ;13;D9;Coverage of GES and targets ;"A common GES has been defined for all subregions. This aims to respect the levels defined by Union legislation and standards of contaminants in fish and seafood for human consumption. This definition is then ‘divided’ into two main points: 
•	Actual levels of contamination of fish and other seafood for human consumption by specific chemical contaminants and the number of contaminants with excessive concentrations in the marine environment are stable or decreasing, and the annual frequency of the maximum level does not exceed the defined threshold.
•	The quality criteria of marine waters and marine products intended for human consumption are respected for microbiological contaminants. 
The GES definition is associated with two indicators. The measures will indirectly impact these indicators. The measures are likely to address the GES definitions.

North East Atlantic 
France defined one general target for all subregions (improving the microbiological and chemical quality of water to limit the significant risk of impact on human health from the contamination of seafood). It has been further developed by three sub-targets: improving the microbiological quality of coastal and transitional waters by limiting transfers of microbiological pollutants linked to inadequate sanitation as well as agriculture. The D8 and D9 measures, taken together, address the above targets. This is primarily accomplished by addressing several human activities as listed above (including urban, agriculture and shipping, when combined with the D8 measures) through, for example, compliance with EU, OSPAR, and MARPOL Directives and agreements. For example, measure M238-NAT1a covers sanitation activities, while measure M237-NAT1a addresses agricultural activities.

FR ;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"France reports marine litter as a relevant pressure in all its subregional marine areas. In the North Sea and Bay of Biscay, France reports fisheries, aquaculture, industry, urban activities, port operations, tourism/recreational activities and shipping as the main sources of marine litter. In the Celtic Seas, France mentions fisheries and shipping. The existing and new measures address this pressure together with all activities reported in Article 8 and at least one additional activity (M014-NAT2 focuses on dredging and solid waste disposal). . France also explains that their D10 measures will contribute addressing microlitter from secondary sources (that derive from the degradation of products during their lifecycle or from the degradation of macro-litter). The main focus of the D10 measures is therefore on the reduction of (plastic) pollution of marine waters to limit the spreading of macro-litter. For the third cycle of the MSFD, France will develop further efforts to reduce micro-plastics directly. For that purpose, there is a need to collect data and increase information in relation to quantities and impacts of microlitter in French marine waters.

At the subregional level, in the North Sea, neighbouring Member States have identified fisheries, tourism and shipping as key activities contributing to marine litter. In the Celtic Seas, fisheries have also been reported by all three Member States (Ireland, UK and France), while Ireland and the UK also both report tourism/recreational activities. Finally, in the Bay of Biscay, only Spain reports specific activities as sources of marine litter (while Portugal does not), which are fisheries, aquaculture, shipping and urban activities. The French measures cover these activities. Micro-litter has never been reported as a pressure for the NEA marine region. 

At the regional level, the PoMs address OSPAR’s objective of substantially reducing ‘marine litter in the OSPAR maritime area to levels where properties and quantities do not cause harm to the marine environment’ as well as some of OSPAR’s indicators related to marine litter (e.g. beach litter). As such, the measures focus both on sea-based and land-based sources of litter, develop removal actions, and include outreach elements.

FR ;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"France provides a non-quantitative definition of GES for D10 (a quantitative definition of GES will be reported in the second cycle of the MSFD), i.e. marine litter and their decomposition products do not or no longer cause significant impacts (France lists five important impacts that should be avoided: risk to marine life, vector of NIS, risk to human health, economic consequences, risk for navigation). However, France has made its definition of GES more explicit by providing a priority list of the significant impacts.

The measures address the GES definition. All measures relate to macrolitter and are (operational) measures that directly contribute to the reduction of litter both on the coastlines and in the marine environment. The link to micro-litter is not made clear in the PoMs and, while no direct removal of micro-litter is envisaged by the proposed measures, it may be assumed that a reduction of macro-litter will indirectly lead to a reduction of micro-litter in the marine environment. In general terms, a reduction of litter on the coastlines and the marine environment contributes to the decrease over time. However, it is impossible to conclude that no significant risk is caused (non-quantitative). This explanation is applicable to all five impacts listed by France in its GES definition.

North East Atlantic 
France has defined two general targets applicable to all three subregions in the NEA marine region. The first (10.1) aims to reduce at source the quantity of waste at sea and on the coast. This target is then ‘divided’ into two operational sub-targets: reducing the quantities produced at source, and more specifically land-based sources (areas of high contribution) such as rivers, sewage networks, etc. The second target (10.2) focuses on the significant reduction of the amount of waste in the marine environment and its impact on species and habitats. This target includes two operational sub-targets:  reducing waste generation from uses and activities on the marine environment through assisting these activities, and significantly reduce the amount of litter in the marine environment by strengthening the collection, repurposing and treatment of different types of marine litter.

Targets have been formulated as trends, making it impossible to measure the actual contribution of the measures towards meeting the targets (lack of SMART target definitions with clear threshold values). France explains that quantification of GES will be provided for the second cycle of the MSFD; it will then define targets with clear threshold values. All existing measures address the targets, so they will contribute to the decreasing trends eventually. For example, measure M245-NAT1a addresses the reduction of the quantities produced at source, measure M016-NAT1b covers some of the land-based sources of litter (e.g. rivers), measures M020-NAT1b and M246-NAT1a contribute to address the operational target about assisting activities generating waste, and measures M247-NAT1a and M018-NAT1b focuses on collection of litter. As such, the measures address the targets. ";The measures address the D10 GES and targets in the NEA subregions.

France defines one general target (target G) that aims to reduce inputs and the presence of waste in marine waters (coastal waste, solid waste, micro particles). This target has been ‘divided’ into four sub-targets: reducing input of waste from coastal cities to the sea (G1), strengthening the management and disposal of coastal and marine waste for all coastal cities (G2), strengthening the collection of waste recovered in fishing gear, and its disposal on land by specialised companies (G3), promoting applied research programmes on micro particles (G4). These targets lack of SMART definitions with clear threshold values. France explains that quantification of GES will be provided for the second cycle of the MSFD; it will then define targets with clear threshold values.

The defined measures address almost all targets, but there is no measure to tackle the last target (G4 on microlitter). The measures do not specify in detail whether they target macro or microlitter. Some measures link to target G / G2 but no detailed information is provided on their effect on microlitter. It is assumed that the measures mainly contribute to the reduction of macrolitter.

In the North Sea and Bay of Biscay, France mentions marine mining, offshore structures, defence operations, seismic research and shipping as the key activities generating underwater noise, while defence operations, research and shipping are reported for the Celtic Seas. The existing and new measures address the pressures and activities reported in Article 8, as well as an additional source of noise: urban activities. In its Article 8, France mentions defence operations through their use of sonar. This activity can be addressed with measures covering shipping. It should be noted that, despite the presence of marine wind farms in the English Channel and its plans to build more, France does not report marine renewables as a potential source of noise. France has clarified that the completely new measure M021_NAT2 addresses all anthropogenic sources of noise in the marine environment, including the marine-based renewable energy generation. Therefore, the measures address the pressures.

At the subregional level, in the North Sea, Member States have identified marine-based renewable energy, research and defence operations (through the use of sonar for example) and shipping as key activities contributing to underwater noise (they do not report anything related to other forms of energy input). In the Celtic Seas, marine research and shipping are reported by all Member States. These activities are covered by some of the measures presented by France, which focus on various activities. Finally, in Bay of Biscay, only Spain also reports noise as a relevant pressure (Portugal does not) and mentions various relevant activities such as marine hydrocarbon extraction, fisheries, port operations, submarine cable and pipeline operations, tourism, research, shipping and solid waste disposal. France does not cover all of these activities through its measures (although some of them might not be relevant for France).

At the regional level, OSPAR aims to develop methods to assess the impact of sound on marine species and to address the cumulative effects of different sources of noise. OSPAR acknowledges the existence of many sources of underwater noise and, by focusing on a few of these, the French PoMs for D11 partly address OSPAR’s objective.

FR ;ATL ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"In France, GES is met when the communication abilities of whales are not affected by noise, when visits to ecologically functional areas by species that are sensitive to noise disturbance is preserved, and if the mortality (direct/indirect) due to noise disturbance is marginal. The two criteria defined for the D11 GES deal with impulse and continuous sounds, each of which is associated with an indicator. The two criterions defined for the D11 GES correspond to the indicators defined by the MSFD. The GES definition addresses impacts in the form of disruption and death, and also refers to habitats. The indicators are designed to map the pressure in respect of low frequency impulsive and ambient noise. It is not clear, however, how these are addressed by any of the measures listed above. In the case of NEA, the GES definitions are addressed by the three existing measures (M250-NAT1a, M251-NAT1a and M252-NAT1b). For the Mediterranean Sea, the GES is addressed by the measures dealing with protection areas (M004-MED1a or M006-MED2), while M041-MED2 probably relates to low-noise engines.

North East Atlantic 
France has identified one target to limit the pressures leading to physiological impacts on species or impairing their detection capabilities and acoustic communication. The protection of functional habitats from noise disturbance is also mentioned. This target is then divided into two sub-targets. D11-1 and D11-2 refer to the limitation of acoustic disturbances (impulsive and continuous noise) related to maritime activities taking into account the sensitivity of marine ecosystems, and influencing the organisation of the maritime space and the definition of the periods/intensity/duration of submarine noise emissions to take into account the sensitivity of marine ecosystems, and are relevant for all three subregions in the NEA marine area. 

The application of measures to the respective (sub-) target is clearly outlined. The existing measures (M250-NAT1a referring to regulatory frameworks, M251-NAT1a related to regulatory frameworks for noise in MPAs and M252-NAT1b the guidance document on noise management both for shipping and marine construction noise) address the target and sub-targets. The new measure M021-NAT2 (methodological guide for noise impact assessments) also addresses the target and the two sub-targets.

HR ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Croatia identified the introduction of NIS as a relevant pressure on its marine environment, pointing to aquaculture (fin-fish and shellfish), shipping, and tourism and recreation (including yachting), as contributors to the introduction and spread of NIS in its waters. While a new measure specifically addresses aquaculture, many measures cover shipping activities. Also, various measures with indirect effects on the NIS-related pressure cover these activities (monitoring or research activities). No measure seems to specifically target tourism and recreation. However, it is possible that the measures reported for shipping also cover yachting, thus addressing recreational activities to some extent. This cannot be confirmed from the information provided. The PoM thus only partially addresses the pressures and reported activities.

At the subregional level, the majority of neighbouring Member States reported aquaculture and shipping as the main pathways of NIS introduction. These are covered by Croatia’s measure. 

At the regional level, one of the UNEP / MAP priorities is to monitor the spread of invasive non-indigenous species: ‘Non-indigenous species introduced by human activities are, to the maximum extent possible, at levels that do not adversely alter the ecosystem’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators). Croatia’s D2 measures contribute to addressing this issue. ";The measures partially address the pressure of introduction of NIS and reported activities. Aquaculture and shipping (ballast water and fouling) are covered by the PoM but it is unclear whether or not tourism/recreational activities are covered (it could be the case through shipping-related measures, but this cannot be confirmed from the information provided). ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/bba54ea1-d487-4b25-b8b3-250443378327/details
HR ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Croatia’s GES definition states that the ‘entry of non-indigenous species as a result of human activities (anthropogenic influence) is under control, which contributes to reducing the risk’. In addition, it states that ‘non-indigenous (invasive) species introduced into the environment as a result of human activities (anthropogenic influence) have not caused significant changes in the ecosystem’. 

The PoM includes a measure establishing an ‘early warning’ system to prevent the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms through ballast water and fouling, as well as new measure M003-KTM34, on the establishment of a system on warning, early detection and rapid removal of invasive non-indigenous species. These measures enable the reduction of the risk of NIS introduction and spread. Various other measures can contribute to addressing the GES definition, such as:
•	Declare the Adriatic Sea a PSSA – this will contribute to reducing the risk of introduction of NIS through international shipping transportation, or via ship ballast water and fouling; 
•	Develop energy efficient eco-shipping, encouraging incorporating technology on ships for the treatment of ballast water; 
•	Establish a system of ‘early warning’ to prevent the transfer of NIS through ballast water and fouling;
•	Strengthen the monitoring of ballast water management, contributing to reducing the risk of NIS introduction by international shipping;
•	Measure M003-KTM36 (Ordinance on the regulating the transfer of cultivated species, farming tools and farming cages) reducing the risk of NIS inflows;
•	Measure M001-KTM34 on the development and implementation of subregional - Adriatic protocol on the implementation of the ballast water management system, minimising the introduction and transfer of NIS;
•	Measure M002-KTM34 on the implementation of a regular survey of port areas, minimising the risk of NIS spread.

Croatia reports one target that includes several elements: establish regular monitoring in areas of particular risk (ports, harbours, farms) in order to obtain information on the occurrence of new NIS (invasive) species, and to acquire new knowledge (biology, ecology) of NIS (particularly invasive species); develop action plans for the management of key high-risk species; reduce the risks of introduction associated with international shipping, one of the key pathways of NIS introduction; reduce the risk of introduction and spread from other key pathways and implement action plans to control the spread of high-risk species; reduce the number of some NIS by commercial fishing. The first element is covered by measure M001-KTM35 on monitoring the recovery of the living resources of the Adriatic in critical areas. The three latter elements are covered by various measures focusing on shipping activities (e.g., M001-KTM34), aquaculture (e.g. M003-KTM36) and fisheries (e.g. M002-KTM39), respectively. Finally, the second element is addressed by the PoM as a whole, as the reduction of NIS introduction through several pathways enables high-risk species to be managed. Also, measure M003-KTM35 aiming to develop a plan to reduce bycatch of protected vertebrate species (marine mammals, seabirds, sea turtles, sharks, rays) by fishing gear could contribute to meeting this target, even though Croatia does not clearly explain how it links to D2.

Therefore, GES and targets are addressed.";The measures address the GES and targets. The measures aim to reduce the distribution, dispersal and abundance of NIS and the potential risks of NIS introduction from various sources (shipping, fisheries, and other key pathways), as well as their impact on the marine ecosystem.

HR ;MED ;13;D3;Coverage of pressures ;"The PoM includes various measures covering fishing activities, addressing the main pressure, extraction of species due to fisheries. It should also be noted that Croatia reports many measures under D3 that focus on other pressures (e.g. NIS). These measures could also have indirect effects on D3.
  
At the subregional level, all neighbouring countries identified ‘fisheries, including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish)’ as the main source of pressure. Commercial fishing is addressed by the measures reported by Croatia. This is not the case for recreational fishing, however, and the measures thus only partially address the relevant activities.

At regional level, the UNEP/MAP has defined an ecological objective for commercially exploited fish: ‘Populations of selected commercially exploited fish and shellfish are within biologically safe limits, exhibiting a population age and size distribution that is indicative of a healthy stock’  (with associated operational objectives and indicators). Commercial fishing is one of the main human activities responsible for the extraction of species. Croatia’s D3 measures contribute to addressing this issue. ";The measures partially address the relevant pressures. The measures cover the most relevant activity, i.e. fisheries. Even though commercial fisheries are indeed covered, it is however unclear whether or not recreational fishing is addressed.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/bba54ea1-d487-4b25-b8b3-250443378327/details
HR ;MED ;13;D3;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Croatia reports five elements in its GES definition for D3: population of commercial fish and shellfish species are exploited within safe biological limits (their age and size distribution is indicative of a healthy stock), population of harvested species are at Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) levels, the reproductive capacity of the stock is maintained at levels that ensure an exploitation of stocks at fishing mortality consistent with maximum sustainable yield (Fmsy), high rate of old and large individuals, no undesirable genetic consequences of exploitation. 

Croatia has defined six targets for D3, of which three (targets 12, 13 and 14) are for types of fish (e.g. demersal, pelagic or shellfish). The objectives include long-term stability, unchanged demographic structure and non-disturbance of the food web, among others. These targets have been reported in the reporting sheets. In the text-based report of Article 10, the other three targets have been defined and are more generally formulated, requiring, for example, that the exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species at levels that can produce MSY. Overall, the targets relate to fishing mortality (F), SSB and age/size structure.

Some measures can be considered to be connected to the control of fish mortality, which in turn will contribute to the SSB (e.g. protect and restore marine biodiversity; permanently or temporarily suspend fishing activities). Where fishing regulations are developed to reduce bycatch of undersized fish of commercially exploited stocks (e.g. M004-KTM35), this could contribute to controlling mortality, as well as contributing to age/size structure. This measure, as well as measure M002-KTM39 (conducting adjustments related to changing fishing technology for fishing of non-native potentially economically important species) could contribute to keeping populations within safe biological limits. Measure M001-KTM38 (identify priority areas for the protection of renewable marine resources) could be used to protect nursery/spawning grounds, which would contribute to supporting stocks. Measure M002-KTM26, on the prohibition of fishing (trawl nets, trawlers, pelagic trawl nets and similar) and other activities above the coralligenous area and in its vicinity, could contribute to specific targets in relation to demersal fish. The CFP is not frequently mentioned in the measures. Finally, even though some measures could be relevant to cover all aspects of the GES and targets definition, it is not clear whether they are sufficient to fully address the definitions.

HR ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Croatia highlighted that the pressure ‘nutrient enrichment’ was relevant for its waters, pointing to aquaculture, industry, agriculture and urban activities (including municipal waste water discharge) as relevant activities causing the pressure. All of these activities are covered by measures in Croatia’s PoM, which also includes specific measures for shipping and fisheries.
At the subregional level, Croatia’s neighbouring Member States identified the same activities as contributors to nutrient enrichment. Pressures are therefore addressed at a subregional level. 
At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s activities focuses on land-based sources. Industry, urban areas and agriculture represent the biggest polluters in the Mediterranean Sea. For example, untreated waste water and agriculture can leach many nutrients into the sea, causing eutrophication. According to UNEP/MAP, 66 million m3 of untreated industrial waste water containing nutrients (as well as other elements such as heavy metals) enter the sea directly every year. The agricultural sector is an important contributor to pollution in the Mediterranean Sea, with more and more fertilisers being used in the catchment basins and coastal areas. These pollutants can get into the sea through run-off water, groundwater, wetlands and rivers . 48% of urban centres lack sewage treatment facilities . MEDPOL, the UNEP/MAP Secretariat and the Programme on Pollution have developed pollution indicators for elements such as chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen . One of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives targets eutrophication: ‘Human‐induced eutrophication is prevented, especially adverse effects thereof, such as losses in biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, harmful algal blooms and oxygen deficiency in bottom waters’ (with associated operational objectives and indicators) . All of the key pressures identified by UNEP/MAP (i.e. industry, agriculture and urban activities) are addressed by Croatia’s PoM.";The measures address all key pressures and activities identified in its Article 8 reporting, i.e. aquaculture, agriculture, urban activities and industry.

HR ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Croatia’s GES definition for D5, the biological community should remain well-balanced and retain all necessary functions in the absence of undesirable disturbance associated with eutrophication (e.g. excessive algal blooms, low dissolved oxygen, declines in seagrasses, kills of benthic organisms and/or fish) and/or no nutrient-related impacts on sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services should exist.

Croatia has defined 11 environmental (qualitative) targets for D5, all of which are dependent on nutrient and/or organic loads to the marine environment being sufficiently low to prevent direct or indirect effects of nutrient/organic enrichment from occurring. These concern: the distribution of photophilic algal community (target 6); Posidonica oceanica density and abundance and plankton biomass (target 9); the good status (WFD of upper infralittoral algal communities and other species (target 8); the maintenance of existing levels of nutrients in the water column and encouraging proper use of fertilisers (target 17); chlorophyll-a concentrations (that should not increase) (target 18); abundance of opportunistic macroalgae (target 19); distribution of seagrass and biocenosis (target 20); oxygen load from anthropogenic sources and occurrence of anoxia (target 21);  distributions and ecological quality of Posidonica oceanica (targets 22 and 24); and cumulative effects at the appropriate spatial scales (target 26).

GES and targets both refer to controlling nutrient levels and reducing direct/indirect effects of nutrient enrichment. For instance, the group of existing measures to reduce the input of nutrients through point and diffuse sources directly addresses targets 18 and 21; new measure M001-KTM26 aiming to prevent coastal silting and construction in algal communities and meadows of Posidonia directly addresses targets 8 and 9. Thus the measures, particularly those focusing on reducing the nutrient input from the key activities (listed in the table above), address GES and targets. ";The measures address GES and targets, despite most of them having only indirect effects for D5, since the measures having direct impacts aim to reduce nutrient inputs to the marine environment from all relevant sources, thereby decreasing concentrations in the sea itself and direct/indirect effects of nutrient enrichment (including impacts on biological communities). ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/bba54ea1-d487-4b25-b8b3-250443378327/details

HR ;MED ;13;D7;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Croatia did not report any activities as the source of hydrographical changes. Nevertheless, the measures reported by Croatia (under D7, as horizontal measures, or reported under the ICZM protocol) are mainly related to planning, permitting and licensing regimes, e.g. EIA, SEA, MSP and ICZM, and would address any activities that could interfere with hydrological processes. Some of the legal regimes applicable (e.g. SEA, MSP, ICZM) would allow for cumulative impacts to be addressed. The spatial scopes of the measures are not specified but some refer only to the WFD and it is unclear if they apply beyond coastal and transitional waters. The measures therefore address the pressures.

At the subregional level, in the Adriatic Sea, only Greece and Slovenia have reported pressures and activities relevant under D7. Greece reports desalination, industry, agriculture, urban and land claim, while Slovenia reports land claim and port operations. These activities are likely to be covered by Croatia’s D7 measures, as explained above. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives concerns hydrographic conditions: ‘Alteration of hydrographic conditions does not adversely affect marine ecosystems’  (with associated operational objectives and indicators). UNEP/MAP’s guideline document on desalination explains that these plants always release brine, whose salinity has an important impact on the marine environment. Desalination plants can thus have a significant impact on the marine environment . Generally speaking, any industry or plant releasing compounds that could change the characteristics of the marine water (its salinity, for example) is likely to disturb the hydrological processes and thus industry can be expected to have an impact on hydrological processes as well. As explained above, the measures set out by Croatia would cover any activities with impact in the marine environment.";The measures address the pressures and relevant activities. Although Croatia has not identified any pressures and activities under Article 8, the reported measures– namely those linking to EIA, SEA, MSP and ICZM – address all activities that could have an impact on hydrological processes.

HR ;MED ;13;D7;Coverage of GES and targets ;"In accordance with Croatia’s definition, GES is achieved when permanent changes of hydrographical conditions do not alter the ecosystem (changes in circulation, low oxygen in the bottom layer, red tide, habitat degradation, changes in biodiversity) or these changes are minimal. The reported measures will contribute to the maintenance of GES by preventing and reducing impacts of various risky anthropogenic activities.  

Croatia defines two environmental targets, which aim to: (i) ensure that all developments take into full consideration any potential impacts, including cumulative effects, at the most appropriate spatial scales; and (ii) maintain current state for non-impacted areas and define GES for Heavily Modified Water Bodies (HMWB). The first target is addressed by existing measures concerning planning, permitting and licensing (including EIA, SEA, MSP and ICZM) for all projects likely to have effects related to hydrographical changes.  No measure specifically addresses HMWB, although one of the measures refers to ‘revitalisation’ and links to the RBMP and WFD, so it may be relevant.

In addition to the activities identified under Article 8, Croatia also includes fisheries, aquaculture, tourism and recreational activities in its measures. 
Croatia, however, does not report accidental pollution under Article 8. Nevertheless, a measure has been put in place to address this pressure. Therefore, Croatia addresses the relevant pressures.

At the subregional level in the Adriatic Sea, the majority of the Member States report industry, urban and shipping as the main sources of contaminants. Croatia covers these activities through its PoM. Also, Greece and Slovenia reported shipping as the main source of accidental pollution, and Croatia covers accidental pollution from shipping in its measures defined for D8.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is associated with contaminants: ‘Contaminants cause no significant impact on coastal and marine ecosystems and human health’ (with associated operational objectives and indicators). Croatia, therefore, contributes to meeting this objective.";The measures address the reported pressures and activities.

HR ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Croatia provided the following GES definition for D8: ‘Concentrations of contaminants are at levels not giving rise to pollution effects’. Several measures state that they will address ‘pollution effects’, but it is not clear how this will be accomplished, for example with respect to the impact tributyltin might have on organisms.

Croatia defined three targets for D8. Target 27 focuses on concentrations of chlorinated pesticides, metals and synthetic contaminants, and data collection on the state of pollution by other priority substances. Target 28 aims to maintain current state for non-impacted areas and define GES for HMWB. Target 29 aims to achieve GES. The descriptions of the measures are quite vague, and the information provided suggests that they should be able to address GES and targets. Whether or not this is sufficient depends on how the measures are carried out in practice. Measures should indeed cover agricultural activities, other sources of contaminants (e.g. reduce and eliminate pollution caused by priority substances through point and diffuse sources) and data collection (through monitoring efforts, e.g. measure M001-KTM36). Target 27 should therefore be addressed. The other two targets are less specific yet are also likely to be covered by the existing measures. If Croatia’s commitment to the WFD is successful, this should reduce the impact of hazardous substances. Croatia also reported at least one existing measure to address the impact of an acute pollution event. It does, however, need to be more precise with regard to its targets, as it is not clear whether or not all targets are fully addressed (especially target 28).

Target 31 should be addressed by the two new measures that focus on monitoring efforts (shellfish, fin-fish and tuna farms, changes in the species composition and the abundance of certain species especially in port areas).

It should be noted that Croatia is the only Member State in the Mediterranean region that do not report litter as a pressure under Article 8. This can be considered as a gap in its marine strategy. The measures reported by Croatia cover the following activities: fisheries, port operations and shipping.

Croatia did not identify the pressure of microplastics (and related activities) on its marine waters but still reports a measure addressing microplastics.

At the subregional level, all neighbouring Member States reported urban discharge as a relevant source of marine litter. The measures reported by Croatia only indirectly cover urban activities. Also, Greece and Italy report shipping activities, while Greece and Slovenia report fisheries, as sources of litter. Croatia cover these activities through its measures. However, Greece and Italy also report tourism/recreational activities as important sources of marine litter, which is not addressed by Croatia’s measures.

Indeed, even though Croatia does not report marine litter as a relevant pressure in its marine waters, the measures still cover fisheries, port operations and shipping. Microlitter is covered by one specific measure.

HR ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Croatia considers that GES for D10 is achieved when the amount of marine litter is reduced and does not threaten marine flora, fauna and habitats. The measures included in Croatia’s PoM chiefly aim to reduce the amount of marine litter (especially macrolitter, and microlitter to some extent) entering the marine environment from land-based sources (waste management) and sea-based sources (shipping and fisheries). One measure aims to collect litter using divers and fishermen, and this includes litter from fishing and tourism as well. Therefore, the PoM will contribute to the achievement of GES for litter.

The environmental targets reported by Croatia are:
•	Target 32: Reducing the total amount of visible marine litter on the shores and in the sea.
•	Target 33: Developing indicators for monitoring marine litter. 
•	Target 34: Developing indicators for monitoring microplastics found in the water column and on the coast.
•	Target 35: Developing indicators for monitoring microplastics found in the stomachs of marine organisms.

Both the micro and macro fractions of marine litter are considered in the targets. While not all measures are explicitly associated with individual targets, the PoM establishes clear links for some measures: measures M001-KTM29 (2), M002-KTM29 (2), M003-KTM29 (2) are associated with targets 32, 33, 34 and 35 to some extent. Through filling knowledge gaps and monitoring efforts, measure M002-KTM29 could help develop indicators on litter (target 33) and its impacts on ecosystems (target 34 and 35). However, target 32 can be fully addressed only if all important sources of litter are covered by the measures. Even though shipping and fisheries are covered, it is not clear whether or not the measures also directly cover urban and tourism/recreational activities, as explained above. Also, no litter removal activities on beaches have been reported among the measures for D10, which could have helped addressing this target. The measures therefore partially address all targets.";The measures partially address the GES and target definitions.

•	Target 37: Monitor trends in the ambient noise level within the 1/3 octave bands 63 and 125 Hz, following JRC recommendations.

Ireland updated its environmental targets in 2016 and eight of the new targets relate to D5. The new targets are all concerned with achieving specified nutrient concentrations or reducing/maintaining direct and indirect impacts of elevated nutrient levels. Almost all targets aim to achieve WFD thresholds in coastal waters, with three addressing the achievement of OSPAR thresholds in both coastal and offshore waters. A final target is the reinstatement of the GES definition. Given that the measures proposed are primarily concerned with reducing nutrient inputs to the marine environment, they address the targets. Nevertheless, this is provided that the WFD measures are assessed as covering the relevant issues in the context of the WFD PoM assessments. 

The measures are likely to go beyond the targets, as they also address cost-recovery of pollution events (M066), education (M015 and M136) and ensuring adequate administrative supervision/ management processes (M125 and M126).";The measures address the D5 GES definition and targets since they aim to reduce nutrient inputs to the marine environment, which should allow for achievement of the relevant WFD and OSPAR thresholds included in the targets and, ultimately, achieve GES.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/75bfb361-3d00-4b5a-afa0-d5286511f6d1/details

IE ;ATL ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Ireland has three D8 targets which make explicit reference to the WFD and OSPAR.

The measures address the Irish targets, particularly through the attention paid to discharges and emissions, e.g. compliance with EU, OSPAR, Stockholm Convention and MARPOL Directives and agreements. Ireland also has a number of control measures to reduce the risk of acute pollution events, such as the implementation of Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) or the measure to ‘ensure operators take all necessary measures to prevent major accidents and limit their consequences for human health and the environment’ (M157). Ireland has a number of measures that do not directly relate to D8 but which could nonetheless indirectly impact the D8 targets and GES (the 10 horizontal measures described in Section 4.1).

It also states that harmful effects on the coastal and marine environment should be avoided. 

Based on the reported information, it is likely that the measures contribute to the reduction of macro-litter both on- and offshore (water column and seabed) and also contribute to the reduction of micro-particles via the implementation of the UWWTD. From the limited information available, it seems unlikely that impacts on marine biota are addressed by the measures. Ireland justifies it by explaining that there is currently a lack of knowledge on the relationship in between the types/amounts of marine litter and its impact on the environment. Research is however ongoing on this subject.

Targets have been formulated as trends (e.g. reduction in the number of visible litter items) with no quantified definition with clear target values to be achieved, making it impossible to assess the real effect of the contribution of the measures to meeting the targets. Only a general statement can be made, to the effect that the link between the measures and the target suggests that they will contribute to the decreasing trends.

IT ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Italy identified the introduction of NIS as a relevant pressure on its marine environment in the Western Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, pointing to aquaculture, shipping, as well as tourism and recreational activities, and fisheries as the corresponding activities responsible for such introductions. The D2 measures reported by Italy address these pressures and activities. It should be noted that measures about shipping activities especially concern ballast water management. Biofouling issues will be indirectly addressed by measure MADIT-M044-NEW8, which is linked to biofouling guidelines.

At the subregional level in the Western Mediterranean Sea, France and Spain point to fisheries, aquaculture, tourism and shipping as underlying causes for the introduction of NIS. In the Adriatic and Ionian/Central Mediterranean Seas, the Member States mainly report aquaculture and shipping as sources of the introduction of NIS in their marine waters. Italy covers these activities.

At the regional level, one of UNEP / MAP’s priorities is to monitor the spread of invasive species: ‘Non‐indigenous species introduced by human activities are, to the maximum extent possible, at levels that do not adversely alter the ecosystem’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators).

IT ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The Italian definition of GES for D2 comprises two parts: minimisation of the increase in the abundance and frequency of discovery of NIS introduced by human activities, in areas at risk (abundance and state characterisation of NIS); and no decrease in the abundance of native species, no deterioration of habitats and no change in the functionality of the ecosystem generated by NIS (environmental impact). The existing measures address specific issues such as those related to the use of NIS in aquaculture, controlling invasive alien species and reducing its population (first part of the GES definition), and also the mitigation of the adverse effects on biodiversity caused by the introduction and spread of NIS (second part of the GES definition). The establishment of a National Focal Point proposed by the new measure will also contribute to addressing GES. The measures therefore address GES.

Italy defined four targets associated with D2: early detection and warning system for NIS in ports (target 2.1), traceability systems for all imports/translocations/displacements of NIS in aquaculture (as required by Regulation 708/2007) (target 2.2), activation of response systems following reports of NIS in ports and aquaculture areas (target 2.3), close knowledge gaps about the impact of specific NIS on the marine ecosystem, as well as the main pathways of introduction and carriers in the Mediterranean Sea (target 2.4).

IT ;MED ;13;D3;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Italy identified fisheries’ activities, including recreational fishing as a relevant factor in the pressure ‘extraction of species’ (fish and shellfish) in all three subregions. Most D3 measures address both pressures and the associated activities, as the measures aim to regulate and reduce environmental impact from both commercial and recreational fishing activities. 

In addition, Italy reported urban areas, agriculture and forestry, their run-off and emissions, as other causes of the pressure ‘extraction of species’. This activity might relate to the influence of land-based activities on the productivity of fisheries’ resources (localized anoxic events) and thus indirectly impact extraction levels. However, the PoM does not link these activities directly to extraction levels and is thus not considered relevant for D3.  
  
At the subregional level, other neighbouring countries also identified fisheries as an underlying cause of the pressure ‘extraction of species’ in all three subregions. In the Ionian and Central Mediterranean Sea, both Greece and Malta specifically highlighted the problem of vessels larger than 12m with mobile gears, which affect the seabed (i.e. trawls, dredges).

IT ;MED ;13;D3;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The GES components fishing mortality (F) and spawning stock biomass (SSB) are addressed by Italy’s PoM through the various measures under the CFP, national legislation and regional (GFCM) and international (ICCAT) measures. National fish stocks are also covered by the existing measures, through various national legislation and management plans, e.g., local management plans, the national management plan for fisheries with hydraulic dredges and rakes, measures on rationalisation of small pelagic fisheries in the Adriatic Sea, 24 local management plans in the Ionian, Central and Western Mediterranean Sea, and fisheries management measures of bivalve molluscs through national legislation. The GES component age/size structure of fish populations is generally not a focus of the CFP, and national measures do not explicitly mention age/size structure. While this may be addressed in the detail of the management plans and national legislation, it cannot be clearly identified from the limited information provided on existing measures. The large number of measures establishing spatial protection areas - and associated management measures within these - will also contribute to addressing the requirements for age/size structure of populations. GES is, overall, addressed.

Italy’s targets for D3 cover four different aspects. Firstly, the targets aim to reduce fishing mortality in line with management plans, through CFP-related measures and other national legislation. Italy’s inclusion of these types of measures suggests that this target is addressed. Secondly, Italy aims to reduce the impact of IUU fishing through the implementation of the EU IUU Regulation. Again, this implementation is included in the PoM, thus the target is addressed. Two of Italy’s targets require the adoption of new legislation for the regulation of recreational fisheries and the setting of minimum landing size of commercial Selachii (i.e. sharks). Even though recreational fishing and shark fishing are both covered in the PoM, they are covered by existing measures and based on existing legislation. Italy has not reported new measures for sharks or recreational fishing in respect of new legislation, therefore these targets are deemed to be partially addressed by the measures.

IT ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Italy, eutrophication of its marine waters is caused by nutrient inputs from agriculture, forestry and urban use in all three subregions, in addition to tourism activities and industry in the Western Mediterranean Sea subregion. The reported measures address the pressures identified for D5 in Italy’s Article 8 reporting, mainly through the implementation of the relevant EU Directives (i.e. the Nitrates Directive and the UWWTD), The measures actually go beyond the pressures reported in Article 8, as they also tackle aquaculture (MADIT-M057/MICIT-M056/MWEIT-M059) as well as atmospheric deposition and sub-marine groundwater inputs (these are dealt with through the implementation of the National Emission Ceilings Directive and the Groundwater Directive, respectively).
At the subregional level, in general, the other Member States in the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea and the Western Mediterranean Sea refer to the same activities as Italy – agriculture, forestry and urban use. Industry has also been frequently reported in the Western Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea, while aquaculture has especially been highlighted in the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea. These activities are likely to be addressed by Italy’s measures; while aquaculture is the object of measure MADIT-M057/MICIT-M056/MWEIT-M059, industry and tourism would be covered by the more general measures.
The Italian measures are likely to tackle the pressures identified by UNEP/MAP as relevant for D5 (pollution from land-based sources, urbanisation of coastal areas, mass tourism, etc.).";The measures address all key pressures and activities identified in their Article 8 reporting – agriculture, forestry and urban use.

IT ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Italy’s GES definition for D5, nutrients and chlorophyll-a levels should remain below certain threshold values in open sea waters, WFD coastal waterbodies should be at least in 'Good Ecological Status’ as defined under the WFD for phytoplankton, and there should be no hypoxia or anoxia in bottom waters.

Italy has defined six environmental targets for D5. These targets are: achieving compliance with the UWWT Directive standards; reducing marine nutrient loads from diffuse sources; reducing total nutrient loads to coastal marine macrophytes I and II from all sources, with an associated reduction in chlorophyll-a concentrations; preventing any increase in total nutrient concentrations in coastal marine macrophytes III, with no increase in associated chlorophyll-a concentrations; and reducing the frequency/severity and extent of hypoxic/anoxic events in bottom waters.

All GES thresholds and environmental targets focus on the management of nutrient loads to the marine environment, nutrient levels within the marine environment, or direct and indirect impacts of elevated nutrient levels. All of the measures are concerned with reducing nutrient loads to the marine environment, meaning that the measures are fully in line with both D5 GES definitions and targets.";The measures address D5 GES and targets since they aim to reduce nutrient inputs to the marine environment from all relevant sources, thereby reducing concentrations in the sea itself and the associated harmful impact(s). ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/ec2fc134-5564-47ec-9983-fa893dd1d78e/details

However, these will be covered by the existing regulatory procedures for the authorisation of projects as described in the existing measures. Therefore, the pressures are addressed. However, no reference is made to cumulative impacts. 

At the subregional level, in general, the other Member States in the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea and the Western Mediterranean Sea point to desalination, industry, agriculture, forestry, land claim and coastal defence, and port operations as the primary causes of hydrographical changes. Although the human activities reported to be as relevant subregionally have not been reported by Italy, they are nonetheless addressed by Italy’s PoM through the existing regulatory procedures for the authorisation of projects.

For the same reason, Italy’s measures will address the pressures identified by UNEP/MAP as relevant for D7 (urbanisation of coastal areas, land reclamation, etc.).";Even though Italy did not report changes to hydrological processes as a relevant pressure under Article 8, the measures reported cover all possible pressures, since all projects which could adversely impact hydrological conditions are subject to the existing regulatory procedures.

IT ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"Italy reports the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds as relevant in its three marine subregions under Article 8. Industry and offshore structures are responsible for this pollution. Italy’s PoM includes several measures that address the pressures ‘the introduction of hazardous compounds’ and ‘accidental pollution’. These measures also tackle diverse activities such as agriculture, industry or shipping. Activities associated with offshore structures are likely to be covered by measure MADIT-M072. Indeed, although this measure concerns accidental pollution, it is likely to have an impact on the introduction of hazardous compounds due to hydrocarbon-related activities, which could include offshore platforms. Therefore, the measures cover all relevant pressures and activities.

At the subregional level in the Western Mediterranean Sea, France and Spain mainly report industry, urban activities, port operations and shipping as being responsible for the introduction of hazardous compounds (they also mention agriculture for the introduction of synthetic compounds). In the Adriatic Sea, the neighbouring Member States mainly report industry and shipping as responsible for the release of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds (urban activities are also mentioned for non-synthetic compounds). Finally, in the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, industry and urban activities have been especially reported for the introduction of contaminants (aquaculture is also reported for non-synthetic compounds). Accidental pollution has been reported as relevant in the Western Mediterranean Sea, as well as in the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, due mainly to shipping. Some of these activities, notably agriculture, industry, aquaculture and shipping as sources of hazardous compounds and shipping as responsible for accidental pollution, are covered by the measures. It is observed that urban activities are often mentioned as a source of hazardous compounds in all three subregions, while port operations are especially reported in the Western Mediterranean Sea. Italy does not seem to cover these activities in these subregions.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is associated with contaminants: ‘Contaminants cause no significant impact on coastal and marine ecosystems and human health’ (with operational objectives and indicators). Therefore, Italy, through its D8 measures in the Mediterranean region, contributes to meeting this objective.";The measures partially address the reported pressures. Italy covers both activities reported in its Article 8 as responsible for the introduction of hazardous compounds in its three marine subregions: industry and offshore structures. However, other sources of contaminants such as urban activities and port operations (reported by neighbouring Member States) do not appear to be covered. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/ec2fc134-5564-47ec-9983-fa893dd1d78e/details
IT ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Italy’s D8 GES definition comprises three elements: the concentrations of each of the regulated contaminants (except radio-nuclides) are lower than the environmental quality standards ; for each of these contaminants, changes in terms of biological effects should not be significant (as explained by Italy, although this part of the GES definition is unclear); the events of serious pollution are prevented and their possible impacts are minimised. 

Italy refers to the WFD in three of its measures (MADIT-M056/MICIT-M055/MWEIT-M058, MADIT-M068/MICIT-M067/MWEIT-M070 and MADIT-M069/MICIT-M068/MWEIT-M071). Therefore, the first part of the GES definition concerning the concentration of contaminants (that refers to the WFD) is likely to be addressed. However, the second part of the GES definition, which aims at ensuring a non-significant change in terms of biological effects compared to their respective controls and thresholds, is partially addressed by the measures. Italy reports one measure that aims to cover the sampling and control of contaminants in the water and in marine species (MADIT-M070/MICIT-M069/MWEIT-M072). As this is an existing measure, the reported detail of information on this measure is limited and it is not clear to what extent contaminant levels in biota and their effects are being addressed. The two measures targeting shipping and accidental discharge (MADIT-M071/MICIT-M070/MWEIT-M073 and MADIT-M072/MICIT-M071/MWEIT-M074) target accidental pollution, thus addressing the third part of the GES definition. Therefore, the GES definition is partially addressed. 

Italy defines three D8 targets. Target 8.1 aims to decrease the concentration of contaminants with a value above the environmental quality standards (by 2020). Target 8.2 focuses on the reduction of knowledge gaps in relation to biological effects of contaminants. Finally, target 8.3 refers to ensuring a lower occurrence of significant events of acute pollution (with a reduction of their impact). 

As explained above, three of the measures are directly linked to the WFD (MADIT-M056/MICIT-M055/MWEIT-M058, MADIT-M068/MICIT-M067/MWEIT-M070 and MADIT-M069/MICIT-M068/MWEIT-M071), which, if successful, will reduce the concentration of hazardous substances, thereby addressing target 8.1. Two other measures will help to reduce the risk of accidental discharge (target 8.3) and are directly linked to IMO and EU Directives concerning, inter alia, the transport of ‘dangerous goods’ and the safety of operations at sea (e.g REACH Regulation and Directive 2013/30/EU on the safety of offshore oil and gas operations) (MADIT-M071/MICIT-M070/MWEIT-M073 and MADIT-M072/MICIT-M071/MWEIT-M074). Italy also defines several national initiatives directly linked to the measures mentioned above. However, it does not report any specific measure for target 8.2 (enhancing the knowledge related to biological effects) and this represents a gap. It may, however be addressed by MADIT-M069/MICIT-M068/MWEIT-M071. Italy’s PoM can be said to partially address the targets.";The measures partially address GES and targets. The second part of the GES definition related to the non-significant change in terms of biological effects is partially addressed by the measures.

IT ;MED ;13;D9;Coverage of GES and targets ;"
Italy’s D9 GES definition comprises two elements: the concentration of contaminants in fisheries’ products are within the legal limits for human consumption; and the frequency of exceedances is within the limits set under the legislation. All three D9-specific measures (MADIT-M074/MICIT-M073/MWEIT-M076 on the control, marketing and labelling of products, but also MADIT-M073/MICIT-M072/MWEIT-M075 on the management of harmful substances and MADIT-M075/MICIT-M074/MWEIT-M077 on the management of diseases in animals) address the GES definition for D9.

Italy defined two targets associated with D9. Target 9.1 is associated with the first part of the D9 GES definition and aims to ensure that the concentration of contaminants in samples of non-compliant fisheries’ products tends to decrease. Target 9.2 relates to the second part of the D9 GES definition, and its objective is to ensure that the frequency of cases of non-compliance tends to decrease in accordance with the limits set by the current legislation. Italy defines three D9-specific measures based on EU legal acts, such as Regulation (EU) No 1881/2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 laying down general principles and requirements of food law, Directive 2006/88/EC on health requirements for aquaculture animals and products. The D9 measures focus on the management and safeguarding of aquaculture, and the marketing and labelling of products. All of which address both D9 targets. ";"The D9 measures, combined with those of D8, address GES and targets.

IT ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Italy reports marine litter as an issue in its three subregions (Western Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea, Ionian and Central Mediterranean), pointing to tourism, recreational activities, urban areas and shipping, as well as fisheries (in Western Mediterranean subregion only) as contributory factors in each case. Microplastics have been mentioned in Italy’s Article 8, without further information and covered by a measure. Italy’s PoM partially addresses these activities. Indeed, tourism/recreational activities are covered by indirect measures.

At the subregional level, in the Adriatic Sea Italy, Greece and Slovenia identify urban activities as an activity causing marine litter. Several major cities are located on the Italian Adriatic coast, such as Venice and Trieste, which are likely causing major urban water discharges into the sea. Also, the Po river discharges into the Adriatic Sea, after passing through Italy’s most populated regions. Italy covers urban activities through an existing measure in its PoM, as indicated in the table above.

In the Ionian and Central Mediterranean, neighbouring countries such as Greece and Malta have both highlighted fishing as an activity contributing to marine litter, as well as tourism and shipping. Italian fishing ships are present in the Ionian and Central Mediterranean Seas, hence, it is likely that Italian fisheries play a role in the production of marine litter in this marine subregion. Fisheries activities in regard to litter production are addressed by Italy’s measures. 

In the Western Mediterranean, both France and Spain identify, as does Italy, fisheries, urban activities, tourism/recreation and shipping as major litter causing activities. 

At the regional level, Italy’s measures refer to the regional action plan for the marine litter management in the Mediterranean (UNEP/MAP), showing an RSC level coordination effort.";The measures partially address pressures. Italy has reported marine litter as a pressure, with shipping, tourism, fisheries and urban areas activities identified as contributing sources. Italy has identified direct measures addressing marine litter (e.g. beach clean-ups), indirect measures focusing on awareness raising, as well as measures which specifically target fisheries, shipping, and urban activities. Tourism and recreational activities are however covered by indirect measures. Microplastics are mentioned in Article 8 (without further information) and addressed by a measure.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/ec2fc134-5564-47ec-9983-fa893dd1d78e/details
IT ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Italy has not defined associated indicators for GES, but indicates that the targets and its associated indicators are all connected to the GES 10.1 (D10-related GES definition provided by Italy). The reported measures address the different compartments: coast, sea bottom and water column as mentioned in the GES definition. It is however unclear to which extent the degradation products (and micro-litter) will be tackled by the PoM. Still, the PoM should contribute to a reduction of marine litter in all compartments and thus to the achievement of GES as defined by Italy. Doubt exist to which extent ‘no significant impacts’ can be assessed with the PoMs.

The existing and new measures have been linked to Target 10.1 (decreasing trends in the amount of litter on the coasts, bottom water and water column, including those floating on the sea surface) and 10.2 (decreasing trend in the amount of waste ingested by marine animals). Although no measure has been directly linked to target 10.3 on reducing knowledge gaps, it should also be addressed, to some extent, by M083 (part of the measure focuses on providing information on marine litter) but also by M084 (Fishing for Litter project).

The awareness-raising measures, covering also beach cleaning activities, indirectly contribute to achieving Target 10.1 which focuses on reducing the amount of litter on coasts. 

The measure related to waste collected by fishermen linked to ‘Fishing for litter’ type projects will also contribute to Target 10.1, directly addressing the marine litter pressure. A reduction of litter (target 10.1) will further contribute to a decreasing trend in the amount of waste ingested by marine animals (target 10.2). Some doubt exists in relation to whether the associated indicator for target 10.2 will both consider the macro and micro-fraction, but it may be assumed that this will be the case.";GES and targets are addressed, as the measures will address litter on the coast, seafloor and in the water column. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/ec2fc134-5564-47ec-9983-fa893dd1d78e/details

Italy does not provide a timeline for the achievement of GES. However, it has carried out a gap analysis on the status of the descriptors that were not covered by the law or by existing arrangements, and which it deemed insufficient to achieve GES and the environmental targets.

IT ;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Italy reports marine hydrocarbon extraction as well as marine research and shipping as a source of underwater noise in its three marine subregions. Italy reports two measures for D11. One will address noise from projects and offshore structures. The second focuses on developing guidelines about impact assessment and mitigation of the effect of underwater noise, especially due to marine research and shipping, on marine mammals. It is specifically explained, in the measures descriptions, that both impulsive and continuous noise are covered. As such, pressures and reported activities will be addressed. 

At the subregional level in the Western Mediterranean Sea, neighbouring Member States (Spain and France) have identified shipping, port operations and marine research as key activities contributing to underwater noise. In the Adriatic Sea, Croatia, Greece and Slovenia report shipping as a source of noise. In addition, Slovenia and Greece mention defence operations as relevant, and Greece and Croatia both highlight marine research. Finally, in the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, marine hydrocarbon extraction and shipping are the main activities highlighted as sources of noise. These Member States do not report anything related to other forms of energy input. Italy’s PoM is likely to address these activities. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP / MAP’s objectives is associated with energy and noise: ‘Noise from human activities causes no significant impact on marine and coastal ecosystems’. Italy’s D11 PoM partially contributes to addressing this objective.";The measures address the reported pressures and activities. The measures will address the noise pressure, as they cover marine hydrocarbon extraction, marine research and shipping, which have been reported in Italy’s Article 8. It is specifically explained, in the measures descriptions, that both impulsive and continuous noise are covered. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/ec2fc134-5564-47ec-9983-fa893dd1d78e/details
IT ;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Italy’s D11 GES definition includes impulsive and continuous sounds introduced in the marine environment through human activities. Both elements aim to ensure that the levels do not cause long-term adverse effects on marine ecosystems and have no significant impact on marine species. The definition mentions both input levels and effects. 

The reported PoM includes measures that provide background information on noise and aim to produce guidance on how noise can be monitored or even reduced (EIA, TG Noise document, IMO guidelines). The PoM therefore does not directly address the GES definition. Nevertheless, the first part (input/level) of the GES definition will be better understood through the set-up of a registry and by measuring and mapping noise, which Italy proposed to put in place in 2014 through its monitoring programmes, in addition to what is reported in their PoM. The reported measures do not currently address impacts of noise, thus partially covering its GES definition. Yet, through the research and data collection efforts, the pressures and effect of noise will be better understood, which is positive. 

Italy defines two targets, each associated with one part of the GES definition. Target 11.1 aims to create a National Register of impulsive sounds, which takes into account all human activities that introduce impulsive sounds in the range 10 Hz - 10 kHz to the marine environment. Target 11.2 focuses on the creation of a ‘baseline level’ for continuous sounds at low frequency (‘ambient noise’) in the three marine subregions. These targets are very operational and limited to monitoring and a baseline study. The measures reported by Italy include supporting documents for ongoing actions/measures and can be viewed as providing input to actions, rather than constituting actions in themselves. However, Italy includes the noise register and a background noise measurement campaign in its monitoring programme for the MSFD, making the programme suitable to address its targets (the measures/actions already in place in Italy in respect of underwater noise address the D11 targets). ";The measures partially address the D11 GES and targets. The reported measures do not currently address impacts of noise, thus partially covering its GES definition.

LT ;BAL ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"Under Article 8, Lithuania has reported port operations, tourism and recreation (including yachting), as well as shipping, as activities contributing to NIS. Shipping (ballast waters and anti-fouling) is covered by various measures. No measures in Lithuania’s PoM specifically address port operations or tourism and recreation (including yachting). These activities might nevertheless be covered by measures with more general applications and for which no specific activity has been reported. Even though these activities could be considered as a less significant contributor to the pressure from NIS introduction than shipping activities, the measures only partially address the reported pressures and activities.

Lithuania is one of the few Member States in the Baltic Sea that did not identify aquaculture as relevant activity. However, as explained in the measure related to ‘Regulation (EU) No 708/2007 concerning use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture’, marine aquaculture does not yet exist in Lithuania. All neighbouring Member States also report shipping as a source of NIS, which is covered by Lithuania’s measures.

At the regional level, HELCOM identifies NIS as a pressure on the marine environment. According to the HELCOM matrix presenting the human activities associated with the pressures, aquaculture, recreational activities/tourism, port activities (industrial and ferry), shipping and mooring/anchoring all contribute to the input or spread of NIS. Lithuania covers shipping activities through its measures. ";The measures partially address the pressure of NIS and the activities reported under Article 8. Shipping (ballast waters and bio-fouling) is addressed, but no measures specifically cover port operations and tourism/recreation. They could be covered by some very general measures covering various activities (not specified by Lithuania), but based on the information provided, this cannot be confirmed.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/141e1335-a7c3-4f7a-8c62-6f399ba1be01/details
LT ;BAL ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets ;"GES for D2 is reached when trends of newly introduced NIS show that no new NIS introductions occur every 10-20 years and when the index of bio-pollution shows that, in comparison to the initial assessment, there is no increase in the bio-pollution index for the region and individual species.

The PoM addresses the GES definition reported by Lithuania. The first part of the GES definition (trends of newly introduced NIS) is addressed by Resolution No 315 ‘on the approval of the State Environmental Monitoring Programme 2011–2017’, as well as the new measure M009-T4PR2 on the inclusion of the State Environmental Monitoring Programme as part of HELCOM’s monitoring of NIS in the Baltic Sea. 

The second part of the GES definition (index on bio-pollution) is addressed by the following measures: 
•	International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (BWMC).
•	HELCOM plan for harmonised implementation and ratification of the Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments.
•	Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species.
•	Order No D1-934 ‘on the approval of action plan 2010–2015 for the Baltic Sea Environmental Protection Strategy’.
•	Order No 352 ‘on the approval of the procedure for introduction, re-introduction and relocation, the procedure for the control and extermination of organisms of invasive species, structure and provisions of the board on control of invasive species, and the introduction, reintroduction and relocation programme’.
•	M008-T4PR1, on ratifying the IMO BWMC and ensuring its implementation. 

The target reported in relation to the second GES definition (bio-pollution index) aims ‘to implement measures decreasing the risk of new NIS occurrence in Lithuanian marine water’, which is similar to the definition of Objective 4 ‘Reduce the risk of introduction of non-indigenous species locally absent in the Baltic Sea into the marine area of the Republic of Lithuania’. As such, all measures listed above, especially those addressing the second part of the GES definition, can address this target.

Overall, GES and targets definitions are addressed.

LT ;BAL ;14;D2;Exceptions ;"Lithuania applies an exception for D2 under Article 14(1)(e) ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’. Lithuania explains that NIS from other Baltic Sea countries may naturally spread to Lithuanian waters and cause environmental issues. However, Lithuania did not report detailed justifications for the exception. Transboundary impact is indeed a very relevant problem in the case of NIS, for which international and regional cooperation is required. This justification could also correspond to Article 14(1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’, although Lithuania only applies Article 1(e) in this case.

The justification provided by Lithuania is found to be only partially grounded. ";Lithuania applies an exception for D2 based on Article 14(1)(e) ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’. It states that NIS from other Baltic Sea countries may naturally spread to Lithuanian waters and cause environmental issues. This assessment finds the justification of the exception only partially grounded. Lithuania has not reported detailed justifications for the exception. Nor does Lithuania report an alternative date for the achievement of GES.;2;Partially grounded ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/141e1335-a7c3-4f7a-8c62-6f399ba1be01/details
LT ;BAL ;13;D3;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Lithuania reported the pressure ‘extraction of species, fish and shellfish’ as relevant for its waters, listing fisheries (including recreational fishing), tourism and recreation (including yachting) and shipping as contributors to this pressure. 
Lithuania’s PoM addresses commercial fisheries through the measures listed in Table 8 above. The existing measures address commercial fishing via the management, conservation and recovery of fish stocks to ensure sustainable fishing, the reduction of discards, multiannual plans for cod stocks, and enforcement (logbook requirements and appointments of supervisors on fishing vessels, although these only have indirect effects), the establishment of requirements for commercial fishing and small-scale fishing. Many existing and new measures foresee monitoring and research. The new measure (M018-T6PR4) aims to improve the licensing system for fishing in the Baltic Sea, ensuring that licensed fishermen receive full and relevant information about the specific area for which the license has been issued. However, the PoM does not provide enough detail to determine whether or not recreational fisheries (or tourism) is fully addressed. It should be noted that Lithuania is the only Member State (all regions considered) that reported shipping as a source of pressure for D3 but no measure addresses it. It is not clear how this activity will lead to the extraction of fish, unless Lithuania considers fisheries a form of shipping activity. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the pressure and reported activities.

In the Baltic Sea, all neighbouring Member States also reported fisheries as the main source of pressure for D3 in the Baltic Sea. Lithuania coverers commercial fisheries in its measures. 

In the Baltic Sea, one of HELCOM’s action areas relates to fisheries. HELCOM acknowledges that fishing can have an adverse effect on the marine environment (stocks, for example). Indeed, fishing concerns both commercial and non-commercial stocks and bottom-trawling may damage species such as thin-shelled bivalves and starfish. Thus, HELCOM considers that fisheries can have an environmental impact on species in the region. Lithuania addresses this concern, and the measures reported as relevant for D3 refer to the HELCOM BSAP. ";The measures partially address the pressure on fish stocks. Measures (e.g. the Order No 3D-20) address fisheries in a general manner, while it is notable that the CFP itself is not listed among the measures. The PoM does not provide enough detail to determine whether or not recreational fisheries and tourism will be fully addressed. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/141e1335-a7c3-4f7a-8c62-6f399ba1be01/details
LT ;BAL ;13;D3;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Lithuania’s definition of GES incorporates the level of fishing mortality (F), and the age and size structure of the population (based on the proportion of fish larger than the mean size of first sexual maturation and the 95th percentile of fish length distribution from research surveys). GES relates to what Lithuania defines as the ‘main commercial fish species’ without further specifying these. The targets (see below) mention cod, sprat, and Baltic herring. Measures do not include spawning stock biomass (SSB), although the achievement of the GES definition in relation to F should lead to recovery of SSB.

Overall, the measures broadly address the GES definition. CFP-regulated stocks and nationally-managed (e.g. coastal) stocks are both addressed (e.g. HELCOM BSAP). However, only cod is specifically addressed by measures, while the GES definition also includes sprat, flounder and herring. Controlling fishing mortality is addressed by a number of measures, e.g. the Law on Fisheries. Age/size structure is not specifically mentioned by any of the measures. While the PoM identifies various measures and existing efforts to regulate fisheries (e.g. Order No 3D-94 relating to the issue, registration, cancellation, suspension and renewal of commercial fishing permits), it remains unclear exactly how these will be used to manage fisheries to achieve GES. Thus, GES is partially addressed. 

The target established in relation to D3 requires the coordination of ‘international fisheries agreements in order to combine efforts to ensure the survival and rebuilt of cod, sprat and Baltic herring populations (in a sustainable way)’. This definition is similar to the definition reported for Objective 1 in the PoM: ‘Ensure that the intensity of exploitation of the populations of commercially exploited fish is within safe biological limits’, under which the D3-relevant measures have been reported. This is addressed via various measures, e.g. HELCOM BSAP, although the target species are not explicitly mentioned.";The measures partially address the GES and targets. CFP-regulated stocks and nationally-managed (e.g. coastal) stocks are both addressed. Several measures also contribute to controlling fishing mortality.

LT ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Lithuania includes nutrient enrichment as a pressure in its marine waters and identifies industry, agriculture and urban activities as the relevant sources of pressures. Urban and agricultural activities are clearly addressed by the measures reported for D5. Even though industrial activities do not seem to be covered by any specific measure, they are likely to be addressed by more general measures targeting various activities or by the national implementation of the Baltic Sea Environmental Protection Strategy (that focuses on urban waste water treatment plants and is also likely to cover industrial activities). Another activity, dredging, is covered by a specific measure. However, it should be noted that this measure aims to develop dredging activities to promote denitrification, which raises questions regarding the sustainability of such measures. As such, the PoM addresses the reported pressures and activities.

In the Baltic Sea, all neighbouring Member States reported agriculture and urban activities as sources of nutrients. Lithuania addresses these activities. Most of the neighbouring Member States also report industry, which is likely to be covered by Lithuania’s measures as explained above, although this cannot be confirmed.

At regional level, HELCOM identifies land-based activities (agriculture and forestry, urban areas, industry, aquaculture, transport and energy production) and sea-based activities (shipping and aquaculture) as the main sources contributing to nutrient and organic enrichment. Some of these activities are addressed by Lithuania’s measures. Lithuania states that it has no aquaculture.";The measures address nutrient emissions from the main sources identified in Article 8. Urban activities and agriculture are covered by several specific measures. Industry does not seem to be covered by specific measures but is likely to be addressed by general measures targeting various activities or by the national implementation of the Baltic Sea Environmental Protection Strategy (that focuses on urban waste water treatment plants and is also likely to cover industrial activities).

LT ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Lithuania defines GES and targets in the same way, with thresholds for:
•	Salinity-related nutrient thresholds in the water column (phosphorus and nitrogen);
•	Chlorophyll-a threshold in the water column;
•	Maximum depth of macrophyte distribution; 
•	Secchi depth related to the increase in phytoplankton (water transparency). 
Nutrient (and organic) enrichment is the cause of eutrophication, with increased chlorophyll-a levels causing decreased water transparency and a subsequent decrease in the maximum depth of macrophyte colonisation. Several measures (old and new) are expected to result in reduced nutrient inputs to the Baltic Sea from several sources. Although the targets are not considered adequate (mirroring the GES definition rather than assisting in its achievement), they are nevertheless covered by the measures.
Measures therefore address the defined GES and associated targets. ";The measures address the GES and target definitions.

LT ;BAL ;14;D5 ;Exceptions ;"Lithuania applies an exception for D5 under Article 14(1)(e) ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’. Considering that the relative increase in phosphorus content in the open sea is determined by flows, not from the land but from deep areas of the Baltic Sea (and this, in turn, depends on the intensity of inflow of North Sea waters into the Baltic Sea), the possibility of achieving GES in the open seas by applying the right management are limited. Lithuania explains (both in its PoM and during the review process of this technical assessment) that, during the preparation of the River Basin Management Plan draft (2015), it was estimated that, to achieve the pollution reduction targets established by HELCOM (2013), the total phosphorus load transported by rivers into the Baltic Sea must be reduced by approximately 20%. Given that the share of phosphorus load introduced from Lithuania amounts to approximately 60% (the remaining 40% of the load comes from Belarus), in order to achieve the objective provided in HELCOM (2013) the pollution load accumulating in Lithuania should be reduced by approximately 35%. As such, achieving HELCOM’s objectives without a contribution from Belarus is not considered possible because this would require big and not proportional cutting of phosphorus loads in Lithuania. It also indicates that approximately 16% of the phosphorus load attributable to Lithuania is produced by natural background; therefore, in order to achieve HELCOM’s objectives, anthropogenic pollution would need to be reduced by more than 50%. This is not technically feasible as currently waste waters in Lithuania are mostly treated to required standards and agriculture does not demonstrate significant pollution with phosphorus.

This assessment finds the justification of the exception to be partially grounded. It will take a significant amount of time before positive results can be measured and effects become noticeable, due to the natural conditions of the Baltic Sea (historical contamination). However, the HELCOM nutrient reduction scheme has been politically endorsed at Ministerial level in 2013. Also, an alternative date for the achievement of GES has not been reported. ";Lithuania applies an exception for D5 under Article 14(1)(e) ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’. It explains that the increase in phosphorus content in open sea is more determined by flows from deep areas of the Baltic Sea (which depends on the intensity of inflow of North Sea waters) than flows from continental part (e.g. riverine), which limits the possibilities to achieve GES. Also, the pollution load reduction that Lithuania should achieve to meet HELCOM’s requirements is too high (more than 50%), and, as such, not technically feasible as currently waste waters in Lithuania are mostly treated to standards and agriculture does not demonstrate significant pollution with phosphorus.

FI ;BAL ;14;D9;Exceptions ;"Finland applies an exception for D9. Finland applies Article 14(1)(a) and (e) ( ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’ and ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’) to D9. Finland states that the current natural state of the marine areas is improving slowly due to lack of national measures. It explains that GES is not completely achievable by the end of 2020, because of the slow degradation of several substances in the natural environment and the slow organic purification process taking place. As such, some compounds are expected to remain in nature for a long time, affecting its achievement of GES for pollutants. 

The concentration of dioxins and PCBs is high in large herring, Baltic salmon, sea trout and lamprey in all Finnish marine areas, especially in the Gulf of Bothnia for dioxins and in the Gulf of Finland for PCBs. Finland also highlights that it was granted an exception from the regulation EC/ 2375/2001 for the dioxin levels in its commercial fish species. This exception allows fish to be marketed in Finland even if their dioxin concentrations exceed the maximum limit for commercial fish as set out by the directive.

Furthermore, Finland states that the main sources of dioxins and PCBs are currently located mainly outside of Finland (hence the use of Article 14(1)(a)), as Finland states to be responsible for only 12% of dioxin concentrations in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, dioxin and PCB contamination from the Kymijoki river is considered a non-negligible source, this is due to historically contaminated seabed sediments and not current industrial activities. 

Finland states that considering current data, it is not possible to define dates for achieving GES. The applied exception relates to the timeline by which GES will be achieved (in this case beyond the deadline of 2020) and not to the full achievement of GES in the future. 

This assessment finds the justification provided for the application of exceptions grounded. ";Finland applied an exception for D9, based on Article 14(1)(a) ( ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’) and Article 14(1)(e) ( ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’), stating that GES will not be achieved by 2020 given the presence of persistent pollutants still found in high concentrations in sediments and biota, namely dioxins and PCBs. The sources of these are identified as being past pollution events in Finland and continuing pollution from other countries in the Baltic Sea (transboundary pollution). Current pollution from Finland is addressed through the D8/D9 measures. This assessment finds the justification provided by Finland for the exception applied as grounded. Nevertheless, the Member State does not specify when GES is expected to be achieved as per MSFD requirements (in relation to Article 14(1)(e)), due to data gaps.;3;Grounded ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/f4148616-5e09-44b9-ac1d-2b503a48bae0/details

LT ;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Under Article 8, Lithuania reported marine-based renewable energy generation, fisheries, dredging, port operations, submarine cable/pipeline operations, defence operations and shipping as activities causing underwater noise. While shipping is covered by specific measures, dredging and port operations are also covered by measures with more general application but for which Lithuania provides examples of actions with direct impact on these activities. Defence operations are only covered by indirect measures (monitoring efforts), but the Member State does not need to cover these activities, according to MSFD Article 2.2 . No specific measure seems to cover marine-based renewable energy generation, fisheries and submarine cable and pipeline operations. Several measures with direct effects on underwater noise include actions to reduce impacts on marine species from underwater noise and reduce noise energy into the marine environment. The measures will contribute to the reduction of underwater noise but are not tailored to the specific activities identified and reported by Lithuania. Therefore, the measures partially address the reported pressures and activities.

In the Baltic Sea, the Member States primarily highlight marine-based renewable energy generation, defence operations and shipping as the principle sources of underwater noise (other activities are mentioned to a lesser extent). Lithuania covers shipping activities through its measures, while defence operations are only mentioned in monitoring measures. Marine-based renewable energy generation is not mentioned by Lithuania. 

At the regional level, HELCOM Experts Network on Underwater Noise (EN-Noise) has been created to work on underwater noise in the short-term (2015-2017), and the HELCOM 37 (2016) meeting has adopted the Regional Baltic Underwater Noise Roadmap 2015-2017. The roadmap recognises the potentially harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on the marine environment and its species. It also highlights piling (for impulsive noise) and shipping (for continuous noise) as the two main sources of underwater noise in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM also mentions other sources). Although HELCOM (more specifically, the 2013 Ministerial Declaration) is reported by Lithuania among the existing legislation having an impact on underwater noise, it also specifies that it is not implemented, as it is not a mandatory measure.";The measures partially address the pressures and activities reported in Article 8. They cover shipping directly. The measures with broader impacts also cover dredging and port operations. Defence operations are only covered by indirect measures (monitoring efforts), but the Member State does not need to cover them (Article 2.2).

LV ;BAL ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Latvia identifies NIS as a pressure in its marine waters and highlights aquaculture (through the ‘replenishment of fish stocks - the release of new species in Latvian coastal waters, complementing existing fish resources’) and shipping as the responsible pathways. 

The Member State explains in its PoM that introductions of NIS from aquaculture are covered through existing measures; however, introductions from shipping are not yet covered. 

The new measure M002 links to IMO-BWC and Regulation (EC) 708/2007 covering the use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture. It aims to increase knowledge. 

Latvia reports two other monitoring, research and knowledge gathering actions to deal specifically with D2 (M001 and M017). As these are data collection and knowledge increase efforts, they do not contribute directly in reducing pressures from NIS. M001 is a monitoring effort, which would be better suited as part of the Article 11 Monitoring Programmes rather than the PoM, and M017 focuses on research and links with other descriptors. 

These measures are therefore considered to indirectly address NIS introductions, as they will contribute to better understanding the NIS problem in the marine waters and determine whether further new measures may be needed in the future; yet do not directly address pressures.

Measure M003 relates to preparations for the ratification and implementation of the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM). The implementation of this Convention will help to address NIS introductions from shipping, in the future 

The two horizontal measures (described in Section 4.1) do not directly address the NIS pressure either, as these are also associated with research activities (development of a database and methodologies for spatial cumulative impact assessment).  

Latvia notes that the specific NIS-reduction measures needed to fully achieve GES are currently unknown and are to be determined at a later stage, including those to be implemented in relation to the BWM Convention. Therefore, only aquaculture is currently covered, while shipping will be addressed in the future. The PoM therefore partially addresses NIS introductions, with shipping which is an important source of NIS introductions not being addressed.  

At the subregional level, all Member States report the introduction of NIS as relevant in their marine waters and most of them link this to shipping. This activity is indirectly covered by the Latvian PoM.

At the regional level, HELCOM identifies shipping and mooring, anchoring and aquaculture, as well as recreational activities, tourism and port activities (industrial and ferry), as contributing to the input or spread of NIS. Latvia has not reported the additional activities reported by HELCOM (e.g. recreational activities) as part of its Article 8 reporting, suggesting that these are not considered relevant for Latvia. ";The measures partially address the pressures. Aquaculture is addressed, yet shipping which is an important source of NIS introductions is addressed indirectly and in the future. Latvia reports that the specific measures to reduce NIS introductions through shipping will be determined once the BWM Convention is ratified and implemented. Several measures focus on monitoring activities. These are more relevant to the MSFD Monitoring Programmes (Article 11). ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/f887c60e-5427-43b5-8d01-4bfa6080451f/details
LV ;BAL ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The GES definition states that GES is achieved when the rate of introduction of NIS is reduced to zero. The existing measures address aquaculture. Measure M003 will indirectly contribute to the reduction of NIS introductions and relates to a single pressure (shipping). Overall, Latvia reports that the specific NIS reduction measures needed to achieve GES are currently unknown and will be determined at a later stage, including those to be implemented after the ratification of the BWM. Currently, the PoM does not address the GES definition.

Latvia has reported a target under Article 9, requiring that NIS introduced through human activities are not at numbers causing adverse effects on the ecosystem. The existing measures aim to reduce NIS introductions from aquaculture. None of the reported new measures relate to the reduction or management of NIS in the environment. M003 could potentially contribute to it in an indirect manner as it is a governance measure. Latvia reports that ‘at present, the knowledge base of the non-indigenous species is insufficient to assess its impact on the marine environment’, thus it remains unclear whether or not further measures are necessary to achieve this target. Measures M002 and M017 can contribute to closing this knowledge gap and determining whether further measures might be necessary to achieve the target. Furthermore, in its Monitoring Programmes (Article 11) reporting exercise Latvia reported a new target for D2, which aims to reduce the negative impact of anthropogenic activities on marine habitats and species. This target is also defined for biodiversity (D1, 4, 6). Both targets are not addressed by the reported measures. It is not clear how negative impacts can be reduced, if shipping is not covered.";The measures do not address GES and targets defined, as only aquaculture activities are currently covered. Other measures could indirectly contribute to decreasing future NIS introductions, as research and data collection efforts will allow for a better understanding of the problem, yet it is not clear how ‘impacts of NIS’ can be addressed via these measures. ;1;Not addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/f887c60e-5427-43b5-8d01-4bfa6080451f/details

LV ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Latvia, eutrophication of its marine waters is caused by nutrient inputs from agriculture/forestry and urban discharges. The measures address the pressures reported by Latvia in its Article 8 reporting for D5: urban discharges and agriculture are presumably directly addressed by measure M004. Furthermore, these activities are covered by the existing measures linking to the WFD, UWWTD, Nitrates Directive etc. Agriculture and forestry are also either tackled or assessed under the indirect measures M005 and M008, provided they are assessed as adequate under the WFD. These are pending the assessment results of the WFD PoM assessments. 

At the subregional level, all neighbouring Member States identified nutrient enrichment as a pressure in the Baltic Sea. Most of the Member States report industry, agriculture/forestry and urban activities as the main sources of nutrient in this marine region. Latvia covers these activities in its PoM.

At regional level, signatory parties to HELCOM defined specific targets for reductions in inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to the Baltic Sea (so-called MAI/CART targets), and indicators for measuring the progress in meeting these targets. According to the HELCOM matrix regarding human activities and pressures, the input of nutrients can be explained by agricultural, forestry and aquaculture activities, restructuring of seabed morphology (dredging for example), shipping and land transport, and urban/industrial uses. Latvia addresses some of these activities through its measures.";The measures broadly address pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting – discharges from urban areas, agriculture and forestry. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/f887c60e-5427-43b5-8d01-4bfa6080451f/details
LV ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Latvia had defined two GES definitions (in its Article 9 reporting and in the text-based report). The two definitions are similar, with the latter referring to threshold values for nutrient concentrations and Secchi depth (in the coastal and transitional waters of the Gulf of Riga; coastal and open Baltic Sea), chlorophyll-a levels, phytoplankton biomass, zoobenthos status and distribution depth of benthic vegetation (coastal waters). As the same thresholds are used as targets, these do not represent interim steps to achieving GES but are rather an iteration of GES. Latvia reported one new target as part of its MSFD reporting on the Monitoring Programmes (Article 11), which is an overarching target that aims to reduce negative impacts from eutrophication in Latvian waters. Based on the information presented in the PoM it is likely that Latvia addresses these GES and targets through its D5 measures, which cover different sources of nutrient enrichment.

LV ;BAL ;13;D7;Coverage of pressures ;"Latvia did not identify, hydrographical changes as a pressure under Article 8 due to a lack of existing data (marine acidification was considered irrelevant to Latvian waters). Furthermore, the Latvian measures do not specifically cover hydrographical changes.

At the subregional level, one of the neighbouring Member States, Sweden, also did not report changes in hydrographical processes as a relevant pressure in its marine waters. The other Member States in the Baltic Sea point to various activities as underlying causes of hydrographical changes, such as industry, land claim/coastal defence, port operations, the placement and operation of offshore structures, tourism and recreation activities. The reported measures are horizontal measures and do not appear to address these. Measure M016 refers in very general terms to EIA legislation and concerns the development of methodological tools. 

At the regional level, changes in hydrological processes in the Baltic Sea can be attributed to various activities such as aquaculture, marine-based renewable energy, extraction of minerals, oil and gas, all types of physical restructuring of coastline or seabed (such as land claim, dredging, offshore structures, coastal defence…), tourism infrastructure, transport infrastructure and military operations.

Latvia did not report underwater noise as a pressure in its marine waters in its initial assessment and thus did not include any associated activities in its Article 8 reporting. While the PoM includes a measure focusing - partly - on underwater noise, together with the two horizontal measures that could apply here, it remains very non-specific about underwater noise. It is not clear if for example a registry of underwater noise is established and how data relevant to D11 will be collected, and it thus does not fully address the pressure. Latvia explains that the new measure for D11 will aim to understand the scale of the pressure noise within its waters. 

At the subregional level in the Baltic Sea, other Member States have mainly identified marine-based renewable energy, defence operations and shipping as key activities contributing to underwater noise. Latvia does not address these activities through its measure (still, it should be noted that Latvia made a link between activities and pressures in its PoM).  

At the regional level, HELCOM Experts Network on Underwater Noise (EN-Noise) has been set-up to address underwater noise in the short-term (2015-2017) and the HELCOM 37 (2016) meeting has adopted the Regional Baltic Underwater Noise Roadmap 2015-2017. This roadmap recognises the potentially harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on the marine environment and its species. It also highlights piling (for impulsive noise) and shipping (for continuous noise) as the two main sources of underwater noise in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM also mentions other sources). Latvia states that measure M017 on research can be seen as an input to the implementation of HELCOM’s Regional Baltic Underwater Noise Roadmap.  ";Latvia does not report underwater noise as a pressure in its marine waters, and does not report measures that will directly contribute to decreasing the pressure. Nevertheless, the reported research measures will contribute to addressing knowledge gaps for this descriptor. Still, most of the neighbouring Member States report marine-based renewable energy, defence operations and shipping as key activities contributing to underwater noise. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses D11 pressures. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/f887c60e-5427-43b5-8d01-4bfa6080451f/details

MT ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Malta identified the introduction of NIS as a relevant pressure on its marine environment, pointing to shipping, followed by other sectors such as tourism and recreation (including yachting) and aquaculture as contributors to the introduction and spread of NIS in its waters. 

Aquaculture and shipping are covered by the PoM, as Malta reports measures that directly target these activities. When reporting tourism and recreation activities, Malta likely refers primarily to yachting, which is addressed by the measures covering shipping, i.e. addressing ballast water but also ships’ hull cleaning. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP / MAP’s priorities is to monitor the spread of invasive species: ‘Non‐indigenous species introduced by human activities are, to the maximum extent possible, at levels that do not adversely alter the ecosystem’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators). Malta’s D2 measures contribute to addressing this issue.

MT ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The D2 measures address the introduction and establishment of NIS from human activities by linking to EU and regional policies relating to shipping (ballast water, hull cleaning), trade in species, measures under nature policy, and aquaculture. These will support the achievement of GES by reducing and preventing NIS introductions as a result of human activities. 

Malta’s two targets (as defined under Articles 8 and 9) were linked to monitoring efforts, the closure of knowledge gaps and evaluation of the effectiveness of the current measures. In its PoM, Malta explains that knowledge gaps on NIS introduction vectors, together with the abundance and distribution of NIS in Maltese waters, made it impossible to set out its targets in the first MSFD implementation cycle. Instead, two interim targets were proposed. 

An early detection system and the closure of knowledge gaps are likely to be covered by measure M025, which contains a sub-set of measures put forward under the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which relate to the early detection of NIS and action to eradicate NIS. This ‘Nature Policy’ measure thus contributes to the interim targets for early detection and development of prevention/control options. It is likely that knowledge gaps will be filled by the monitoring programmes reported under Article 11.

An assessment of the effectiveness of existing measures will be addressed by Measure M024, which includes a technical feasibility assessment for the management of ballast water, as part of Malta’s preparations to comply with the incoming BWM Convention.

Overall, the targets are addressed. ";The measures address the GES and targets. GES is covered, as the measures address various introduction vectors of NIS caused by human activities.

MT ;MED ;13;D3;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Malta reported the pressure ‘extraction of species, fish and shellfish’ to be relevant for its waters, listing the activities fisheries (including recreational fishing) and vessels larger than 12m with movable, seabed-affecting gears as contributors to the pressure. Malta’s PoM addresses commercial fisheries, including vessels larger than 12m. Recreational fisheries are addressed by one measure, although it is uncertain if the actions undertaken will reduce the associated pressures due to its limited scope.   
  
At the subregional level, other neighbouring countries also identified fisheries as an underlying cause of the pressure ‘extraction of species’. Greece specifically highlighted the problem of vessels larger than 12m with mobile gears which affect the seabed (i.e. trawls, dredges). 

At regional level, the UNEP/MAP has defined an ecological objective for commercially exploited fish: ‘Populations of selected commercially exploited fish and shellfish are within biologically safe limits, exhibiting a population age and size distribution that is indicative of a healthy stock’  (with associated operational objectives and indicators). According to UNEP/MAP, the fishing effort increased until the mid-1980s in the Mediterranean Sea, reaching about one million tons, and has decreased since 2000, due to weak fisheries management. Since then, some fisheries have been rebuilding and expanding. However, many stocks are fully exploited, while others have collapsed entirely . Fishing is one of the main human activities responsible for the extraction of species.";The measures address the activities of commercial fisheries, including for vessels larger than 12m, as per its Article 8 reporting. Recreational fisheries are also addressed, although there is some uncertainty about the extent to which this measure addresses this activity as the scope of the measure is limited. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/21df4b49-2dc8-4836-aa4a-540ddd6b6d35/details
MT ;MED ;13;D3;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Malta’s definition of GES incorporates the concept of sustainable exploitation (which implies stock biomass and level of fishing mortality, although these are not explicitly stated) and the age and size structure of the population. Various measures address fishing effort, which should help to rebuild stock biomass, while gear restrictions support age/size structure. Existing measures under the CFP, ICCAT and national legislation address sustainable exploitation. Also, age and size structure can be addressed through technical measures such as fishing gear restrictions (mesh size, etc.) as per measure M033. Malta’s GES definition relates to ‘fish stocks’, specifically ‘selected commercial species’, therefore it does not apply to ‘all commercially-exploited fish and shellfish’ as specified in Descriptor 3 of MSFD.

The PoM covers both of its defined targets. Firstly, target 1 relates to achieving sustainable levels of fishing effort over time, with a view to ensuring sustainability of the stocks targeted by Maltese fisheries. This target is mainly addressed by existing European fisheries legislation (on capacity and effort management, catch limits, gear restrictions, discards, measures relating to elasmobranchs), which draws on regional measures through the GFCM, ICCAT and national legislation (M030, fisheries management plans for specific fisheries).

Target 2 relates to better use of independent data to analyse fish populations, which is largely addressed by M035. Although this measure is partly related to fisheries-dependent data (catches, effort, etc.), it also relates to improving information on dolphinfish fisheries to identify stock units and critical habitats, and to define growth parameters and maturity ogives, all of which requires fisheries-independent data. Malta did not link M035 to target 2 but, rather, linked the target to fisheries-dependent data (catches, etc.) instead of fisheries-independent data (e.g. research cruises). M035, however, addresses the target more directly. ";The measures address the D3 GES and targets.

MT ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Malta highlighted that the pressure ‘nutrient enrichment’ was relevant for its waters, pointing to aquaculture, agriculture, urban activities (including municipal waste water discharge) and shipping as relevant activities causing the pressure. All of these activities are covered by measures in Malta’s PoM. The measures address both discharges from industry and recreational boating activities. It should be noted, that in relation to measure M043, there is currently an open infringement case on the performance of the plants in the framework of the UWWTD. The contribution of this measure to the MSFD PoM and how it can address pressures on the marine environment directly depends on the outcome of this infringement case and if the acceptable performance of the said plants is ensured by Malta.
At the subregional level, Malta’s neighbouring Member States identified the same activities as contributors to nutrient enrichment. Pressures are therefore addressed at a subregional level. 
At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s activities focuses on land-based sources. Industry, urban areas and agriculture represent the biggest polluters in the Mediterranean Sea. For example, untreated waste water and agriculture can leach many nutrients into the sea, causing eutrophication. According to UNEP/MAP, 66 million m3 of untreated industrial waste water containing nutrients (as well as other elements such as heavy metals) enter the sea directly every year. The agricultural sector is an important contributor to pollution in the Mediterranean Sea, with more and more fertilisers being used in the catchment basins and coastal areas. These pollutants can get into the sea through run-off water, groundwater, wetlands and rivers . 48% of urban centres lack sewage treatment facilities . MEDPOL, UNEP/MAP Secretariat and the Programme on Pollution have developed pollution indicators for elements such as chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen . One of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives targets eutrophication: ‘Human‐induced eutrophication is prevented, especially adverse effects thereof, such as losses in biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, harmful algal blooms and oxygen deficiency in bottom waters’ (with associated operational objectives and indicators).

MT ;MED ;13;D5 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Malta’s GES definition for D5, nutrients and chlorophyll-a levels should not depart significantly from natural levels of the Mediterranean Sea, and biological communities should be indicative of either undisturbed conditions or of slight/localised changes associated with nutrient enrichment.

Malta has defined one environmental target for D5, which states that long-term data on nutrient levels in the marine environment or on direct/indirect effects of nutrient enrichment, in relation to the main sources of nutrient input, is indicative of the effectiveness of existing mechanisms addressing nutrient input in the marine environment.

GES and targets both refer to nutrient levels and direct/indirect effects of nutrient enrichment. Malta’s D5 measures focus exclusively on pressure control: reducing nutrient and organic inputs to the marine environment, thus the primary assessor of its effectiveness should be nutrient and organic levels in the water column. Chlorophyll-a levels are just a direct effect of these (nutrient levels at least) and should be considered a component of ‘biological communities’. Based on the information provided by Malta, it is likely that GES and targets are addressed for D5. This is conditional on the outcome of the infringement case against Malta in relation to the performance of its wastewater plans in the framework of the UWWTD. Malta added that links between the UWWTD infringement case and the achievement of MSFD GES still need to be demonstrated through the outcome of the monitoring programme.";"The measures address D5 GES and targets since they aim to reduce nutrient inputs to the marine environment from all relevant sources, thereby reducing concentrations in the sea itself and direct/indirect effects of nutrient enrichment (including impacts on biological communities).

MT ;MED ;13;D7;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Malta, the main source of hydrographical change is the interference with hydrological processes caused by land claim and coastal defence, port operations, industry and dredging. Malta added that desalination/water abstraction could also lead to slight interferences with hydrological processes through the discharge of brine, but the effect of such discharge is very localised and may not be significant within the broad marine areas under consideration. All these activities are addressed by the specific D7 measure, together with the horizontal measures reported by Malta (which cover EIA and SEA licensing schemes and aim to assess applications for development consent on a case-by-case basis). Nevertheless, cumulative impacts are not likely to be addressed by the reported measures.

At the subregional level, in the Ionian Sea, the Central Mediterranean Sea and the Western Mediterranean Sea, only Greece has reported pressures and activities relevant under D7. Greece reports activities similar to Malta as relevant (desalination, industry, agriculture, urban and land claim). These activities are likely to be covered by Malta’s D7 measures. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives concerns hydrographic conditions: ‘Alteration of hydrographic conditions does not adversely affect marine ecosystems’  (with associated operational objectives and indicators). UNEP/MAP’s guideline document on desalination explains that these plants always release brine, whose salinity has an important impact on the marine environment. Desalination plants can thus have a significant impact on the marine environment . Generally speaking, any industry or plant releasing compounds that could change the characteristics of the marine water (its salinity, for example) is likely to disturb the hydrological processes and thus industry can be expected to have an impact on hydrological processes as well.";The measures address the pressures identified in its Article 8 reporting, such as land claim and coastal defence, port operations, industry and dredging (as well as desalination/water abstraction to some extent), through EIA and SEA permitting processes.

Malta added that desalination and aquaculture can also lead to discharge of contaminants, but input loads of synthetic substances from these activities are very low. Most of these activities are covered by general measures for various industrial operations, including permitting processes and the control of priority substances. Aquaculture and urban activities are covered by specific measures. In addition to the activities identified under Article 8, Malta also includes marine hydrocarbon extraction, agriculture, shipping and dredging through its measures. 

Malta’s Article 8 also reported accidental pollution to be relevant, chiefly caused by industry, port operations and shipping. These activities are all addressed by activity-specific measures in its D8 measures. 

At the subregional level in the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, hydrocarbon offshore activities, shipping, exploitation, industry and urban activities are significant sources of contaminants (aquaculture is also reported for non-synthetic compounds). Malta covers these activities through its PoM. Also in the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, only Greece has reported accidental pollution from shipping as relevant.

MT ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Malta’s GES and targets for D8 can be divided in two: firstly, contaminant concentrations; and, secondly, acute pollution events. 

For contaminant concentrations, Malta’s GES aims to keep concentrations of selected contaminants under environmental quality standards. Given that its PoM covers various activities, and therefore substances, the reported measures will contribute towards the achievement of GES.  

One target for contaminant concentrations sets out that long-term monitoring of selected contaminants is indicative of acceptable levels of contaminants, with no deterioration trends for non-synthetic and synthetic contaminants in relevant matrices. The second target aims to improve knowledge of sea-based source pollution and risk assessments of activities of the maritime sectors. The PoM addresses both of these targets and should reduce contaminant inputs into the marine environment, thereby reducing concentrations. Malta complements its measures with monitoring activities to improve knowledge and understanding in this area.  

In its GES, Malta sets out that acute pollution events should be prevented (including for hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, shipping and land-based activities). The PoM includes various measures to address acute pollution events from different activities, thus working towards GES.  

The target defined for acute pollution events includes establishing a system for data collection and reporting on important pollution events in order to improve understanding of significant trends and develop the necessary responses.

UNEP/MAP also published a report on the assessment of marine litter in the Mediterranean Sea.

The pressures are therefore only partially covered. 

At the subregional level in the Ionian/Central Mediterranean Sea, marine hydrocarbon extraction and shipping are the main activities highlighted as sources of noise.

The measures cover the most important introduction pathways (shipping, through fouling and ballast water) and aquaculture (transport). Without knowing the detail of the measures, it can still be assumed that they should lead to fewer introductions of NIS, thereby supporting the achievement of the GES. The GES definition is therefore addressed by the reported PoM. 

The Netherlands defines one target for D2 on minimising the risk of new NIS introductions. This target is associated with three indicators (number of NIS present in the marine environment, number of new NIS in that year, the ratio between the biomass of NIS and indigenous species for a sample of specific species groups in the Natura 2000 areas). The measures enable the control of ballast water (M043 and M044) and ship hull fouling (M045). Transport for aquaculture is also covered by a licensing process (M006). This suggests that the main pathways for NIS introduction are controlled. Assuming that such control is sufficient, the Netherlands’ D2 measures address targets.

NL ;ATL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"There is one additional measure not directly targeting a particular pressure or activity but, rather, focusing on economic incentives and investment schemes; this was not included in the table above.

According to the Netherlands’ initial assessment, eutrophication of its marine waters is caused by nutrient enrichment originating from agriculture, forestry, urban areas, industry and shipping. The reported measures address the pressures and activities reported by the Netherlands under Article 8 for D5, mainly through the implementation of the relevant EU Directives (e.g. the UWWTD and the Nitrates Directives) but also comply with the IMO-MARPOL International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, namely the IMO Marine Engine Regulations and the entry into force of the NOx Emissions control area in the North Sea. There is no explicit reference to the Industrial Emissions Directive, but industrial emissions of nutrients would be addressed through improved waste water treatment. While acknowledging that about one-third of the nitrogen entering its marine waters comes from the atmosphere, the Netherlands states that national measures have little or no effect on such atmospheric deposition. The Netherlands has clarified that atmospheric deposition comes from all European countries and considers that measures to reduce emissions should be taken in a European context. 

At the subregional level, nutrient enrichment is identified as a pressure for the North Sea by the majority of neighbouring Member States. The human activities reported as relevant subregionally are agricultural and industrial activities, as well as urban areas. All of these are addressed by the Netherlands’ PoM. 

At regional level, OSPAR refers to point-source pollution from urban areas and diffuse-source pollution from farming areas. Both of these are covered through the reported measures above.

The Netherlands’ GES for D5 therefore refers to direct/indirect indicators of the effects of changing nutrient levels. Given that the measures reported aim to reduce nutrient inputs to the marine environment and that these should result in the minimisation of the adverse effects of eutrophication, they should be able to address the GES definition. No aspects of eutrophication are excluded. 

The Netherlands reports four environmental targets for D5 for the North Sea. The targets concern the reduction of nutrient concentrations to levels allowed by the WFD, ensuring that algae biomass and blooms and the concentration of chlorophyll a during the phytoplankton growth season do not exceed 50% above the background value, and that there is no increased occurrence of harmful algae blooms and no oxygen deficiency due to eutrophication.

As such, the timelines are partially appropriate.;2;Partially appropriate ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/ffa8f6c7-f2da-48fa-928d-0a87a1e33181/details
NL ;ATL ;14;D5 ;Exceptions ;"The Netherlands applies one exception for D5, for which they cite three Articles, namely;
•	Article 14(4) ‘No significant risks and disproportionality of costs’, 
•	Article 14(1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’,
•	Article 14(1)(b) ‘Natural causes’.

Several grounds are cited for this exception:
-	Between 1990 and 2013, the Dutch discharges of nitrogen and phosphorus decreased by 48 and 71% respectively. Cross-border river cargo discharges decreased in the same period by 20-40% for nitrogen and more than 50% for phosphorus. The main internationally-agreed measures for achieving the nutrient targets derive from the Nitrates Directive and the UWWT Directive, in addition to those from the WFD. Based on these measures, the River Basin Management Plans assume that the nitrogen concentrations will continue to decline in many places but possibly not in areas that receive extra manure from surplus areas. The Member State adds that assuming that the WFD objectives are achieved, the Netherlands estimates that GES for nutrients will be within reach in the years after 2020 in accordance with the Marine Strategy. The Netherlands adds that ‘the fact that very few eutrophication phenomena occur in the Dutch part of the North Sea indicates that actions taken are sufficient to achieve this result.’ 
-	Phosphate from the riverbed is released for some time after measures have been implemented (in some cases for up to 40 years), and is accelerated and intensified during high-volume river discharges due to climate change. This means that it is difficult to establish an exact link between observed eutrophication phenomena and the effects of policy and management measures. The dependence on emission-reducing efforts by upstream countries also figures in the eutrophication of transitional waters in the Dutch estuaries. MSFD targets are usually achieved at the area of Lobith, but the pressure caused by fertilisers originating in upstream countries is greater than the national contribution. Atmospheric deposition is also an issue on which national measures have no or very little effect. 

According to the Netherlands, the PoM is the maximum effort that can be made together with other countries to achieve GES for D5. No (additional) technical measures will be taken that can remove the presence of nutrients in the Dutch part of the North Sea. Nor is there any immediate urgency for doing so, given the limited eutrophication effects that still occur in the sea. 

The first part of the justification requires that high-volume river discharges can be attributed to climate change rather than natural variability, which may be the case, but this cannot be verified, especially since climate change effects as opposed to other more direct pressures cannot be segregated. This is also acknowledged by the Netherlands, so it is not clear how the Member State would be able to identify the contribution of climate change to eutrophication and thus decide on the measures that it needs to apply. As such, the justification is partially grounded.

Secondly, the Member State refers to pollution from upstream countries which cannot be controlled by the Netherlands. Indeed, pollution from upstream countries may be an issue. The application of Article 14(1)(a) links to the transboundary nature of the problem. The justification provided is found to be grounded. 

Thirdly, the Member State refers to riverbed sediments which may continue to be a net source of phosphate to overlying waters for up to 40 years. The internal loading from sediments to the sea itself is indeed an issue that cannot be pragmatically addressed via measures. The application of Article 14(1)(b) refers to natural causes. The justification is found to be grounded. 

Finally, the Netherlands states that ‘limited eutrophication effects still occur in the sea’, hence there is no risk of eutrophication. Yet, the Third OSPAR Integrated Report on the Eutrophication Status of the OSPAR Maritime Area, 2006-2014 showed large parts of the Dutch North Sea coast to be an eutrophication problem area . 

Overall, the justification provided for the D5 exception is found to be partially grounded. The Member State states that eutrophication is not issue in the North Sea, while the OSPAR assessment presented different results. Most arguments presented refer to climate change effects, upstream pollution, atmospheric deposition and to nutrient release from sediments, with varying degrees of grounded justifications provided.  ";"The Netherlands applies one exception and refers to Articles 14(1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’; 14(1)(b) ‘Natural causes’ and 14(4) ‘No significant risks and disproportionality of costs’. This exception covers nitrogen inputs during high-volume river discharges (due to climate change), sediment as a source of phosphorus, and nutrient emission reduction efforts by upstream countries. The Member State states that eutrophication is not an issue in the Dutch part of the North Sea, while the OSPAR assessment presented different results. Overall the justifications provided are assessed as partially grounded. Even though natural and transboundary effects reduce the likelihood of achieving GES for D5 for the Netherlands and the costs to remove historically contaminated sediments are high, the risk of eutrophication in the Dutch North Sea is important (according to OSPAR); in addition, effects of climate change cannot be clearly determined so the justification provided is not fully grounded.

NL ;ATL ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"All relevant pressures reported in Article 8 (introduction of hazardous compounds and accidental pollution) are addressed by the Netherlands’ PoM. Several measures address the pressures related to discharges and emissions (of several types of hazardous compounds), as well as acute pollution events (accidental pollution). The Netherlands reported shipping, industry, agriculture/forestry, urban activities (and ‘other marine uses’) as sources of (non-)synthetic products and radio-nuclides, together with shipping and marine hydrocarbon extraction, as factors contributing to accidental pollution. All of these activities have been covered by the Netherlands’ measures for D8. One measure also concerns recreational/tourism activities. Therefore, the Netherlands’ PoM addresses the relevant pressures and activities for D8.

At the subregional level, Member States have, broadly, identified ‘industry’ as having an impact on the introduction of synthetic, non-synthetic and radio-nuclide compounds, pointing to ‘shipping’ as a factor for accidental pollution, in particular. The Netherlands covers these activities through its existing measures.

At the regional level, the Netherlands’ measures for D8 is in line with OSPAR’s objective of ‘preventing pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions, and losses of hazardous substances, with the aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances’. To this end, the measures focus on diverse types of compounds, as well as targeting several human activities and areas that contribute to the release of such products in the North Sea (quality of the bathing waters, discharges from shipping, TBT ban, shipping incidents, industrial emissions, discharges from oil and gas installations, accidents, sustainable plant protection, cooperation during disasters or incidents, tax measures, agricultural water management, sewage treatment plants’ purification efficiency).

Therefore, despite registered downward trends, GES ‘is not expected to be within reach for most substances until after 2020’. In this respect, the Netherlands concludes that additional policy development is unlikely. The Netherlands notes that the current policies to address the discharge of pharmaceuticals and other new micro-pollutants may not provide a ‘total solution’ in the short term and states that this subject will require attention in the next couple of years.

NL ;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"The Netherlands reports tourism/recreational activities, fisheries and shipping as sources contributing to the pressure ‘marine litter’. It reports plastic products as a source contributing to the pressure ‘micro-litter’. The existing and new measures address all relevant pressures and activities, and also include measures focusing on micro-plastics and recreational activities or port operations. The Netherlands’ PoM thus addresses the relevant pressures and activities for D10. 

At the subregional level, neighbouring Member States have identified fisheries, tourism and shipping as key activities contributing to marine litter. Looking at the Netherlands’ immediate neighbours, Belgium has identified fisheries and tourism/recreational activities as sources of marine litter, while Germany mentions fisheries and shipping. No country at the subregional level reports micro-litter as being a relevant pressure for its marine environment in the North Sea. The Netherlands, however, covers these pressures/activities through its measures.  

At the regional level, the Netherlands’ measures for D10 address OSPAR’s objective of substantially reducing ‘marine litter in the OSPAR maritime area to levels where properties and quantities do not cause harm to the marine environment’. As such, the measures focus both on sea-based and land-based sources of litter, develop removal actions, and include educational and outreach elements.

NL ;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The Netherlands provides a general, non-quantitative definition of GES for D10, i.e. the properties and quantities of marine litter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment and their volume decreases over time. A reduction of litter found on the beach contributes to this decrease over time. However, it is not possible to conclude that this also actually means that no harm/damage is caused. The existing and new measures tackle both the problem of the macro (e.g clean up campaigns, waste management measures, etc.) and micro-litter (e.g. reduction of microbeads in cosmetics), and are (operational) measures that directly contribute to the reduction of litter mainly on beaches, but also in the marine environment through for example the ‘Fishing for Litter’ programme. Removal of micro-litter is targeted by two measures. In addition, the reduction of macro-litter should indirectly lead to a reduction of micro-litter in the environment, leading to the conclusion that the Netherlands’ D10 measures address its GES definition.

The Netherlands reports two D10 targets, formulated as trends (impossible to measure the actual contribution of the measures towards meeting the targets). The target 10a explicitly mentions visible beach litter, without including any definition of ‘visible ’. Target 10b, related to the decreasing trend in the quantity of litter, relies on an indicator that refers to the OSPAR-EcoQO Fulmar indicator, which considers plastics ≥ 1 mm. This target therefore includes both macro- and micro (< 5 mm) fractions. The measures have not been directly linked to the targets, but their description allows for them to be classified into six clusters: agenda-setting and awareness, beaches, river basins, shipping, fishing, and plastic products. A link can thus be made to the targets, as the clusters represent the link to potential sources and all contribute to the targets, to a certain extent. The Netherlands’ D10 measures can therefore be said to address its targets’ definitions. As an example, measures M024, M027, M031 and M056 contribute to addressing target 10a, while measures M033 and M071 address target 10b.";The measures address the GES and targets.

OSPAR acknowledges the existence of many sources of underwater noise and aims, at the regional level, to develop methods to assess the impacts of sound on marine species and to address the cumulative effects of different sources of noise. By focusing on several of these sources, the Netherlands’ measures for D11 partly address OSPAR’s objective.

•	Introduction of energy, including underwater noise that does not adversely affect marine environment.
•	Loud, low and mid-frequency sounds and continuous low-frequency sounds introduced into the marine environment through human activities do not have adverse effects on marine ecosystems.

The GES definition is extremely broad and is addressed by most of the D11-specific measures. It remains unclear how project specific regulations and codes of conduct as expressed in several measures (such as measure M035) could reduce ecosystem effects.  The Netherlands specify that it has explicitly committed to the implementation of these guidelines through the MSFD programmes of measures (M059).

The Netherlands lists two specific targets associated with D11. One concerns individual cases (target 11.a), such as pile-driving and seismic surveys and aims to prevent harmful effects of these activities on the ecosystem (particularly on marine fauna). The associated indicator is about the distribution of loud impulsive noise in space and time. The other target (11.b) is revisionary and as specified by the Netherlands, it will be applicable from 2018 onwards when more knowledge has been gathered (about background noise and accumulation of effects on populations or at the ecosystem level). The associated indicator is on continuous low-frequency noise. It is clear that the measures ‘licensing for offshore wind farms’ (M034) and ‘adjustment of regulation on seismic surveys’ (M037) directly address the formulated target 11a. The other measures address either non-noise sources or noise sources not mentioned in the environmental goal. This demonstrates that the Netherlands has provided measures that go beyond the targets.

PL ;BAL ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Poland reported aquaculture and shipping as relevant activities for causing the pressure introduction of NIS in its waters.  The activities are addressed in Poland’s PoM. There are a number of existing and new measures for D2 which directly address the effects of shipping (ballast water management and anti-fouling measures) and aquaculture on NIS introductions. Several measures can be expected to lower the risk of NIS introductions, such as measures taken in the context of implementing the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan. The programme of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, along with the action plan for the period 2015-2020, the project ‘Updated Programme Water and Environment’ and KTM34-3 focusing on educating aquarists. Several other measures focus on monitoring of alien species by entering them in the State Environmental Monitoring System by the Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection (CIEP), the pilot implementation of monitoring of species, and ‘the Green Paper on marine knowledge 2020: from seabed mapping to predicting the ocean’. While monitoring will not directly decrease the pressure from NIS introductions, it can nonetheless provide relevant data and have an indirect impact on the marine environment.

At the subregional level, all other Member States in the Baltic Sea identify shipping as a relevant activity for causing NIS introductions, and aquaculture is reported as relevant by three other Member States in the region. Poland therefore addresses the activities associated with NIS introductions considered relevant by the Baltic Member States generally. 

At the regional level, HELCOM identifies NIS as a pressure on the marine environment. According to the HELCOM matrix presenting the human activities associated with this pressure, aquaculture, recreational activities/tourism, port activities (industrial and ferry), shipping and mooring/anchoring all contribute to the input or spread of NIS. The Polish PoM focuses mainly on addressing aquaculture and shipping activities. However, shipping might also cover port activities and certain recreational activities (e.g. yachting), yet this cannot be fully verified.

Measures that address abundance and state characterisation of NIS include the measures taken under the Ballast Water Convention (development of tools for the control and management of water and sediment in ports), measure KTM34-3 (education of aquarists about the risks associated with the release of specimens of invasive alien species into the environment), and measure KTM34_8 on preventing the escape of alien species of fish from breeding facilities. These measures contribute to progress towards achieving GES, specifically addressing NIS introductions. 
The impact of NIS is addressed by measures such as the programme of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, along with measures taken in the context of implementing the action plan for the period 2015-2020, and also through measure KTM34_5, i.e. development of action plans to reduce the impact of invasive species, including the determination of the status of the current threat from alien species, which should involve the development of measures to address the impacts of NIS. 
Lastly, there are general measures which contribute to achieving GES for D2, such as the measures within the framework of the ‘Maritime policy of the Republic of Poland until 2020 (with outlook until 2030)’, which also aims to prevent the introduction of invasive alien species through ballast water. 
Poland has two main targets, similar to the GES definition. The first target is to understand the distribution vectors of invasive NIS and to minimise their introduction, aiming for zero introductions during the assessment period. The second target is to reduce the negative impacts of NIS on native species. The reported measures address all relevant aspects of the targets, such as understanding NIS vectors and pathways, NIS introductions and NIS impacts. Monitoring and research, such as monitoring of alien species into the State Environmental Monitoring System (CIEP) and measure KTM34_2 (identification and analysis of pathways of unintentional introduction or spreading of invasive alien species posing a threat to the EU on the territory of the country with regard to marine waters) will lead to a better understanding of the distribution vectors of invasive NIS. These are likely to have indirect impacts on the marine environment and indirectly contribute to achieving the targets. 

Measures taken in the context of the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan, and measure KTM34_3 (education of aquarists) to raise awareness of the risks associated with the release of invasive alien species into the environment is likely to also lead to reduced NIS introductions. Finally, measures such as KTM34_5 (development of action plans to reduce the impact of invasive species), including the determination of the status of the current threat from alien species, should reduce the impact of NIS on native species, again through increased knowledge (indirect impacts).

PL ;BAL ;14;D2;Exceptions ;Poland reports that the likelihood of achieving GES for D2 by 2020 is low, and it applies an exception under Article 14 (1)(a) (‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’). The justification provided for the application of the exception is that NIS introductions are of transboundary sources, with specific reference to NIS being introduced from bordering waters which are outside of EU control. The Member State has further clarified that approximately half of NIS recorded in the Baltic have been introduced through ballast water from shipping. Another quarter has reached the sea as a result of deliberate stocking of alien species in the Baltic Sea basin (mostly freshwater fish and crustaceans from the Black Sea basin). Poland generates only a certain portion of the shipping traffic and has deliberately stocked its waters with very few alien species, most of which do not thrive in the sea (e.g. Prussian carp). It is therefore highly likely that species that have entered the Baltic through other channels than Polish sea or inland waters will continue to expand into Polish marine waters. For example, of the 120 alien species listed in a HELCOM database, only 21 are known to occur in Polish waters and there are 13 NIS that occur in HOLAS areas adjacent to Polish HOLAS areas, but have not been reported from Polish HOLAS areas. This shows that the potential for migration of further NIS into Polish marine waters is high. The provided justification is grounded as indeed it is likely that already introduced NIS in the Baltic Sea could spread into Polish marine waters and it is very difficult to control this spread once these species have entered the marine environment. Furthermore, the Member State has defined relevant new measures to address NIS introduction from national sources. ;Poland applies an exception with Article 14(1)(a) stating that GES is unlikely to be achieved in light of impacts from transboundary sources from neighbouring countries.

PL ;BAL ;13;D3;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Poland identified the activities of fisheries - including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish) and seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting - as contributing to the pressure ‘extraction of species’ (fish and shellfish). Poland’s PoM addresses fisheries through both its existing and new measures. 

Commercial fisheries are addressed through the implementation of the CFP, which is referred to in several of the existing measures (e.g. Maritime Policy of the Republic of Poland), as well as other measures. Recreational fisheries are likely to be addressed through two existing measures (i.e. the restocking of the Vistula and Odra Basins) although this link is not explicitly stated. Lastly, although Poland identifies seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting as a pressure for D3, none of the existing or new measures are likely to address this pressure. 
At the subregional level, Poland reports fisheries - including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish) and seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting - as contributing to the pressure ‘extraction of species’, while the other Member States in the region report fisheries including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish) but not seaweed or other sea-based food harvesting. Poland’s PoM, however, does not address seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting despite reporting this activity as relevant in its Article 8 reporting. 

At regional level, Poland has one existing measure which relates directly to the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). ";The measures partially address the activities included in Poland's Article 8 reporting, as they address commercial fisheries and potentially recreational fisheries. It does not address the activities related to seaweed and other sea-based food harvesting despite Poland having reported these as a relevant activity causing the pressure ‘extraction of species’.  ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/3b819bdd-6dec-46b8-b2c4-e3bf7f254bf3/details
PL ;BAL ;13;D3;Coverage of GES and targets ;"As the PoM refers to the implementation of the CFP (referred to in the existing measures under ‘Maritime Policy of the Republic of Poland’ and the ‘OP FISH 2014-2020’), both fishing mortality and spawning stocks biomass, which are part of the GES definition for the main commercial species, are likely to be addressed, as these are covered under the CFP. 

The fish stocks listed among the indicators for the Polish GES and targets are: western cod, eastern cod, western flounder, sprat, western herring and the central herring stock. These are all covered by the CFP. Poland’s GES definition, however, states explicitly that it applies to all commercially exploited fish and invertebrates. Measures related to inland and coastal fisheries, including those within the framework of implementing the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan, are likely to address these criteria for non-CFP stocks. In particular, the new measure KTM14_3 on the promotion of the Polish Code of Responsible Fisheries (which appears to involve educating fishermen to promote compliance, help minimise by-catch, etc.), and the new measure KTM37_4, will contribute to improving the status of all stocks, including coastal stocks not otherwise addressed under the CFP. Nevertheless, it remains somewhat unclear whether or not the PoM addresses all populations of commercially exploited fish and shellfish. 

No measures directly address the age and size structure of stocks as this is not a focus of the CFP, which is the main means of delivering D3 for many stocks. However, measures to achieve the CFP objective of exploiting species at MSY are likely to support stocks to reach an age/size structure considered representative of a healthy stock. Additionally, the existing measure for the Operational Programme points to the possibility to support innovative projects such as the replacement of nets with more selective tools to reduce by-catch, which might also have a positive effect on the age/size structure of populations. These metrics are therefore likely to be addressed, even if they are not explicitly referred to in the PoM. Overall, this assessment finds that the PoM will help Poland to progress towards the achievement of GES, although uncertainties remain about the coverage of non-CFP stocks and age/size structure of stocks.

The targets mirror the structure of the GES definition and the same assessment therefore applies. The implementation of the CFP and its associated data collection and enforcement activities should address targets 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 in relation to achieving, or moving towards, Fmsy and Bmsy triggers for the main commercial species, while other national measures should contribute to achieving MSY objectives for non-CFP stocks. For target 3.3.1 on age/size structure, while there are no specific measures, the comprehensive set of targets should still allow for progress to be made.  ";The measures partially address GES and targets, as they tackle fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass and potentially (but not explicitly) the age and size distribution of commercially exploited species. Poland’s measures may benefit all exploited species, although it is unclear whether this is sufficient to achieve GES for all commercially exploited species.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/3b819bdd-6dec-46b8-b2c4-e3bf7f254bf3/details
PL ;BAL ;13;D3;Timelines ;"Timeline to achieve GES
Poland states that targets for reducing fishing mortality to levels in line with MSY can be achieved by 2020 with suitable TACs. It notes that the recovery of the spawning stock biomass (SSB) also depends on environmental conditions and not only fishing mortality. In the case of the Eastern Baltic cod stock, the environmental conditions have not been conducive to a good growth of cod and this stock might therefore be subject to an exception in accordance with Article 14(1). Poland does not report whether the SSB of other stocks will be at MSY levels in 2020, or if the TACs will be sufficient to reach Fmsy. Overall, it is unclear whether Poland expects to achieve GES by 2020.

PL ;BAL ;13;D5 ;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Poland, eutrophication of its marine waters is caused by nutrient inputs from fishing, industry, agriculture, forestry, urban areas and solid waste disposal including dredged material. Urban, agriculture and forestry nutrient discharges are targeted by the measures for improved nutrient control by both existing and new measures. Industry is mainly covered by the Implementation of the Industrial Emissions Directive. However, solid waste disposal (implementation of the Landfill Directive and EU targets to reduce disposal of solid waste to landfill should reduce the level of nutrients emitted, but this is not included in the PoM) and fishing do not appear to be tackled by either the existing or new measures. The measures also tackle shipping (four new measures) (existing measures, KTM1_2 and KTM4_1).

All neighbouring Member States identified nutrient enrichment as a pressure, and mostly identified the same activities as Poland, i.e. industry agriculture and urban activities. As explained above, these activities are covered by Poland’s measures. 

According to HELCOM, inputs of nutrients stem from agricultural, forestry and aquaculture activities, restructuring of seabed morphology (dredging), shipping, land transport, urban and industrial uses. Most of these activities are addressed by the Polish measures. No measures tackle aquaculture as a contributor to Polish marine nutrient export nor is any nutrient budget provided to indicate its relative importance. On balance, this is not considered an important omission from the PoM. Land transport is assumed to be tackled under existing measures through the implementation of existing EU legislation.";The measures partially address key activities identified in the Polish Article 8 reporting – agriculture/forestry, urban areas, industry, solid waste disposal and fishing.

The environmental targets are target thresholds for nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth, opportunistic macroalgal abundance, perennial benthic vegetation abundance and dissolved oxygen concentration. Thus, both GES and environmental targets are based on nutrient concentrations in the water column and their direct and indirect effects.

Poland states that full implementation of the suggested actions is likely to achieve the reduction levels for nitrogen set by HELCOM by 2020, but for phosphorus the gap between the 2012 status and GES will be reduced by only half, due to a lag period between control measures being put in place and the corresponding reductions in phosphorus loads to the sea. It is therefore likely that GES will be achieved after 2020. However, Poland also states that modelling results suggest the required thresholds should be achieved by 2020. No timeline is presented indicating a reasonable level of certainty that GES will be achieved.

The measures address these pressures and activities, as well as another non-reported pressure, i.e. accidental pollution (mainly due to shipping), and other diverse activities related to the release of contaminants, such as shipping, agriculture or work in defence/military-related facilities. Poland also addresses atmospheric (emissions) and riverine discharges. It therefore addresses the reported pressures and activities and goes beyond what has been reported. It should be noted that, although Poland does not report agriculture as a potential source of hazardous compounds in its Article 8, this activity is relevant and should have been reported. Indeed, almost all of the surface water flowing across Poland drains into the Baltic Sea. Poland does cover this activity through its D8 measures.

At the subregional level, Member States have mainly identified ‘industry’ and ‘urban activities’ as sources of contaminants. Also, the Baltic Sea countries report ‘shipping’ as the main source of accidental pollution and highlight several activities associated with the introduction of radio-nuclides (industry is also reported by Sweden and Denmark).

The D8 measures will all contribute to address this GES definition because they address the defined target (see below for full explanation).  

Poland defines one target for D8. This aims to control the current concentration and effects of pollutants in order to minimise the adverse effects of hazardous substances on marine organisms. It is associated with two criteria and three indicators (concentration of more than 20 different contaminants in water, sediments and species; effects; and acute pollution events/impacts). This list of contaminants corresponds to HELCOM’s list of core indicators, to which Poland is a party. The list of measures for D8 can collectively address the targets. A few measures name specific contaminants such as mercury, cadmium and dioxins (e.g. HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan), which is especially useful to address the two first indicators associated with the defined target. While no targets are directly related to riverine discharges or atmospheric deposition, several measures address these issues (e.g. discharging of industrial waste or ships’ emissions controls).

This assessment finds the justifications provided by Poland to be grounded as indeed some contaminants (heavy metals, dioxins and POCs) are persistent and take a long time to break down in the marine environment.;3;Grounded ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/3b819bdd-6dec-46b8-b2c4-e3bf7f254bf3/details

PL ;BAL ;13;D9;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Poland’s D9 GES definition relates to the levels of contaminants in fish and other seafood for human consumption (which should be below standard levels). This definition is associated with two indicators on the current detected level of contaminants and the frequency of the exceeded limits. The D9-related measures will contribute to addressing this GES definition by addressing the defined target (see below for full explanation). Poland’s D9 measures thus address the GES definition.  

Poland defines a target for D9 related to the control of the current concentrations and effects of pollutants to ensure that fish and other seafood are fit for human consumption. The concentrations should be below values established by the EU or other relevant standards, which implies that they adhere to Regulation 1881/2006 (even if this is not explicitly mentioned). The target is associated with a single criterion and two indicators (concentration above agreed level for about seven types of contaminants; frequency of exceeding these contaminants). Poland’s list of measures for D9 can collectively address the target. A few measures name specific contaminants, such as mercury, cadmium and dioxins (HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan), which is especially useful to address the two indicators associated with the defined target.

PL ;BAL ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Poland highlighted marine litter as an issue in its marine areas, mainly due to tourism/recreational activities. In its PoM, it identifies measures to address both marine litter in general (through measures on awareness, education and beach clean-up) and specifically targeting fisheries, shipping and tourism. Additionally, several existing measures relate to land-based sources and industrial activities. Micro-litter is also addressed through measure KTM29_7, though only indirectly as this measure focuses on research.

At the subregional level, the majority of the Member States highlights tourism/recreational activities and shipping as important causes of marine litter in the Baltic Sea region. Measures have been established on tourism/recreational activities by Poland – like beach cleaning - but there is also a new measure to phase out single-use packaging. Poland also puts in place measures on shipping. Despite indicating that other marine uses contribute to marine litter, Poland does not specify what these activities may be. 

At regional level, although fisheries, shipping, ports and industry seem to play a role (as identified by HELCOM), they have not been reported by Poland as causes of marine litter. However, these activities are addressed by measures (existing and new) for marine litter proposed by Poland, indicating their attempts to limit the negative effects caused by these activities.

PL ;BAL ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"
Poland defines GES as ensuring that ‘property and quantities of marine litter do not cause damage to the coastal and marine environment.’ The measures reported address the different aspects: coast, sea bottom and water column, while also addressing the issue of microplastics. It is likely that a continued trend to reduce marine litter will result in less damage, but it is currently difficult to state with certainty that such a reduction will prevent all damage to the coastal and marine environment. Therefore, the PoM will contribute to a reduction of marine litter in all matrices and for both the macro and micro-fractions, and thus to the achievement of GES as defined by Poland. It is not clear to what extent the GES requirement of ‘no caused damage’ can be covered by the reported measures. 

Poland states its overall environmental target for D10 as the reduction of the amount of emerging or solid waste deposited in the marine environment from various sources, to levels that guarantee the correct functioning of the ecosystem, taking into account its natural resistance, or to completely eliminate the emerging waste. Although Poland has adopted numerous measures addressing to this issue (the existing and new measure have all been linked to the overall target and its two criteria 10.1 and 10.2), the target to ‘completely eliminate the emerging waste’ sets an extremely high threshold, meaning that the measures will likely result in improvements and yet may fail to achieve such a target. Moreover, there seems to be a connection between GES and targets, but it has not been made clear by Poland.";The measures partially address GES and targets.

According to Poland, the measures associated with studies, research (monitoring, analysis), legal and administrative actions, have an effect that will be known only after completion of operations, making it difficult to predict the results of those actions. No timeline has been reported for achievement of GES.

PL ;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Poland report underwater noise (or other form of energy input) as a pressure in its marine waters under Article 8, and identifies the activities marine-based renewable energy, fisheries, defence operations, and shipping as relevant to cause this pressure. The D11measures reported by Poland address shipping and port operations by specific measures. The other activities are likely covered by licensing and EIA measures, but this cannot be verified based on the reported information. Furthermore, most new measures have indirect effects, therefore the measures are likely to partially address relevant pressures for D11. Research measures will positively contribute in characterising the pressure of noise better. 

At the subregional level, in the Baltic Sea, the Member States point to shipping as the principle source of underwater noise (other activities are also mentioned, such as defence operations or marine based renewable energy, but to a lesser extent). Poland covers these activities through its measures. 

At the regional level, HELCOM Experts Network on Underwater Noise (EN-Noise) has been created to work on underwater noise in the short term (2015-2017) and the HELCOM 37 (2016) meeting has adopted the Regional Baltic Underwater Noise Roadmap 2015-2017. This roadmap recognises the potentially harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on the marine environment and its species. It also highlights piling (for impulsive noise) and shipping (for continuous noise) as the two main sources of underwater noise in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM also mentions other sources). Poland focuses on this pressure and some of these activities in its PoM.";The measures partially address relevant pressures. Even though shipping and port operations are addressed by specific measures, other activities (i.e. marine-based renewable energy, fisheries, defence operations) will be covered by licensing and measures that relate to EIA assessments. Most new measures will have indirect impacts and will not directly contribute to a reduction of pressures. While the reported measures do not yet directly address any pressures, they contribute to better characterise pressures, understanding risks and to the work of defining thresholds at the EU/(sub)regional level.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/3b819bdd-6dec-46b8-b2c4-e3bf7f254bf3/details
PL ;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Poland defined D11 GES as follows: ‘the introduction of energy, including underwater noise, is maintained at such a level as not to cause any negative impacts on the marine environment’. It is associated with four criteria (impulsive noise, continuous/ambient noise, electromagnetic fields and heat generation). The existing and new measures reported by Poland address GES, but mostly indirectly through monitoring and research activities. For example, the new measure KTM28_2 will indirectly cover GES in regard to ambient noise, while KTM28_4 will indirectly address GES for impulse noise. However, the two last GES criteria on electromagnetic fields and heat generation (as well as the first two) will both be directly addressed by the existing measures on Licensing Sea/ EIA Reports and the Habitats Directive. Therefore, the measures partially address GES for D11. 

The D11 target aims to achieve a level of underwater noise that guarantees the proper functioning of marine organisms by taking actions to reduce the sources and noise, as well as determining the protection zones that buffer the source of prohibited noise. It is associated with two criteria (impulsive sounds and continuous noise). The existing and new measures reported by Poland address these criteria partially, as a number of measures cover the pressure indirectly. ";"The measures partially address GES and targets; as even though it addresses both ambient and impulsive noise, several measures only have indirect effects and cover monitoring and research (i.e. implementation of a noise registry).

There are no measures for ballast water management or introduction of anti-fouling on ships which are necessary to address NIS introductions through shipping and aquaculture which are identified by the Member State as key pathways linked to this pressure.  

Furthermore, Portugal is also not in line with subregional pressure and activities, as France and Spain had also identified shipping and aquaculture as relevant activities responsible for the spreading of NIS. Therefore, the measures do not address the regionally-identified pressures.

Exploitation rate (F) and biomass (B) are defined for the Continental and Madeira subdivisions and covered by the PoM. The Continental GES refers to age distribution and the Madeira GES definition to population structures by age or size. It is not clear from the reported information whether Portugal covers these parameters through its PoM, nor is it clear if the measures cover all relevant stocks. The measures cover CFP stocks, and highly migratory stocks. One measure covers national fisheries measures, but it is not clear whether all relevant nationally managed stocks on the mainland or in the Azores and Madeira are addressed by the measure. In the Madeira subdivision, a new measure focuses only on a single species, the black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), making it unclear if all relevant species to achieve GES are covered. 

Portugal reports different targets for the Continental, Madeira and Azores subdivisions. The targets Cont.1 to 5 for the Continental subdivision are addressed by the PoM, as the measures address sardine and hake (Merluccius merluccius) biomass and support sustainable exploitation of white monkfish (Lophius piscatorius), four-spot megrim (Lepidorhombus boscii)) and shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus).  

For the Madeira subdivision, Portugal reports measures to address the target Mad.2, which aims for sustainable exploitation of the black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo). 

For the Azores subdivision, the target Azo.6 refers to achieving sustainable fishing in line with the CFP. The assessment finds that the existing measures addressing all subdivisions, in addition to the Azores specific measures, will address this target. 

Overall, the Continental target Cont.8 and the Madeira targets Mad.1 to 3, 5 and 6 have been reported for all descriptors and refer to monitoring networks and an improvement of studies and research. They are thus relevant for the monitoring programme assessment rather than the PoM assessment.

According to Portugal under Article 8, agriculture is the main source of nutrients causing eutrophication problems. It is likely that the WFD measures reported by Portugal will address agriculture, urban and industrial discharges. However, due to the limited reported information it is not clear how these activities will be covered. Therefore, the reported measures partially address the single activity reported under Article 8 for D5.

At the subregional level, nutrient enrichment is identified as a pressure by both Spain and France. The main human activity that is reported by France, Spain and Portugal as relevant at the subregional level (for both the Bay of Biscay and Macaronesia) is agriculture (although France and Spain also report aquaculture, industry and urban activities).

PT ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"Portugal reports shipping and marine hydrocarbon extraction as, respectively, sources of contaminants and accidental pollution (in both Bay of Biscay and Macaronesia). In terms of pressures, the Portuguese measures address what has been reported in Art.8 (contaminants and accidental pollution). Moreover, most Portuguese D8 measures address several human activities such as shipping, dredging or fisheries, while some are more general and do not target a specific activity (other than oil and gas spills from tankers). Therefore, it is not clear if all reported pressures/activities are addressed by the Portuguese PoM: shipping as a source of contaminants is addressed by the measures but uncertainties remain about marine hydrocarbon extraction responsible for accidental pollution. Therefore, Portugal’s PoM partially addresses the pressures and activities.

At the sub regional level, in the Bay of Biscay, France, Spain and Portugal report the introduction of hazardous compounds as well as accidental pollution as pressures in their marine environment. All three Member States report shipping as responsible for the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. It should still be noted that France and Spain have also identified various other activities contributing to the introduction of hazardous compounds such as industry, urban, port operations and agriculture, as well as shipping for accidental pollution. In Macaronesia, the reported activities are different. Spain reported port operations, urban activities and shipping as contributing to the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, while it only reports port operations and shipping in the case of accidental pollution. Portugal does not always report the same activities associated with the pressures as do the other Member States, nor does it seem to cover all activities through its measures (e.g. industry).

At the regional level, OSPAR’s objective linked to hazardous substances is ‘preventing pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions and losses of hazardous substances, with the ultimate aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances’. The information reported by Portugal is insufficient to assess whether or not its PoM addresses this objective. ";The measures partially address the reported pressures and activities. The measures cover several human activities such as shipping, dredging or fisheries at the same time, while some do not target a specific pressure/activity at all. Riverine discharge or atmospheric deposition are not addressed. The measures address the relevant pressures but one of the reported activities is not covered (marine hydrocarbon extraction as a source of accidental pollution). ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/36a0e5b8-8ce3-47f5-a227-de86e8337983/details
PT ;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The Portuguese PoM is broadly in line with the Portuguese GES definitions for all its subdivisions, although since the content of the reported measures is vague conclusions are not easy to provide. For Portugal, GES is achieved if less than 10% of the assessment area is impacted or faces threats to the ecosystem. This approach should be viewed with caution, especially if it is applied to near shore areas and not dealt with under the WFD. Even though Portugal has a large area to assess (>51000 km2 within 12nm), 10% nonetheless represents a very large area that could host important hotspots.

Portugal has defined four specific environmental targets for D8. Three concern the Continental subdivision and the last concerns the Azores. The measure Cont.9 enables the acquisition of better knowledge on the processes that govern the variation of concentrations in biota. Cont.10 will be used to assess trends in the concentration of pollutants in fish. Cont.11 focuses on the re-assessment of the concentration of pollutants in sediments (considering only the top layer of sediments). Azo.14 indicates that concentrations of pollutants in fish from the Azores will be measured to assess these against quality standards (for foodstuffs). There are no targets specified for contaminant inputs (e.g. atmospheric deposition or for riverine discharges) or acute pollution events such as accidental or illegal discharges. Portugal provided no explanation for excluding a monitoring programme to assess possible breaches of environmental quality standards, which is a gap in reporting that influences the completeness of the information being assessed, considering its obligations under the WFD, MSFD and OSPAR. Moreover, two targets, dedicated to Madeira, seem to be relevant for almost all descriptors: Mad.3 and Mad.4 both focus on monitoring and data collection. These targets could potentially be addressed by various indirect measures. The defined measures for D8, in combination with the D9 measures, could enable to address the proposed targets (for example, MECMAD04-D8 can address both targets 9 and 11, whereas ME13-D1 could tackle target 9 and 10, the other existing (directive/convention related) measures and the horizontal measures are likely to also address the D8 relevant targets). Therefore, the PoM seems to address GES and target definitions. Although, as the content of the measures reported is vague this conclusion cannot be guaranteed. Thus, the D10 PoM partially addresses the GES and target definitions.

Furthermore, as mentioned, there are no targets to address riverine discharge or atmospheric deposition. While it can be assumed that riverine discharge is covered under the OSPAR RID (Riverine Inputs and Direct Discharges) programme, it should nevertheless be included by Portugal in its PoM. Atmospheric deposition, too, can be a serious source of hazardous substances but there is no mention of a target for this pressure either. This could be addressed by a programme monitoring contaminants in atmospheric deposition, such as that existing under OSPAR’s Comprehensive Atmospheric Monitoring Programme (CAMP). Portugal does not refer to the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) Directive in any of its measures. ";"The measures broadly adhere to the Portuguese GES and target definitions; yet the reported information is too vague. The PoM therefore partially addresses these definitions. Riverine discharge or atmospheric deposition are not addressed, and the measure fail to link to the EQS Directive and to the OSPAR CEMP (Coordinated Environmental Monitoring Programme).

In terms of activities, the reported activities for D9 by Portugal are the same as those reported for D8, namely shipping and marine hydrocarbon extraction (in Bay of Biscay and Macaronesia). The measures proposed by Portugal for D9 focus on various activities or do not target specific ones. Therefore, it is not ensured that the activities mentioned in Article 8 are fully covered by the PoM. Besides, the D8 related measures do not address all of these activities (marine hydrocarbon extraction is not) and as such the measures partially address the relevant D9 pressures.;The D9 measures, combined with the D8 measures, partially address the reported pressures and activities (some of them only seem to be addressed, but ‘marine hydrocarbon extraction’ does not seem to be tackled by any D9 or D8 related measure).;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/36a0e5b8-8ce3-47f5-a227-de86e8337983/details
PT ;MED ;13;D9;Coverage of GES and targets ;"In combination with the D8 PoM, the measures set up by Portugal address D9 GES definition (despite the fact that the content of the reported measures is vague), which states that contaminants should not exceed levels established by Union legislation (less than 10% of the samples show positive deviations to the regulatory levels).

Portugal has defined three environmental targets (which have not been updated) directly related to hazardous substances for D9 (four other targets could also relate to D9 but are not specific to them). Two concern the Mainland/Continent and the last concerns the Azores. These address the targets that Portugal has defined for 2012. Only one (no.14) indicates that concentrations in fish from the Azores will be measured and assessed against quality standards (for foodstuffs). Another (no.10) will be used to assess trends. A third (no.9) will aim to gain better knowledge of the processes that govern the variation of concentrations in biota. The defined measures for D9 address the proposed targets (for example, MEA10-D9 can address both targets 9 and 14, whereas the existing measure could tackle target 10). Nevertheless, the information reported is too vague to be certain on whether the PoM fully addresses GES and targets, as in the case of D8.

PT ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"Although Portugal admits the presence of marine litter in its coast and marine areas (in Bay of Biscay and Macaronesia) it does not clearly associate it with a specific activity.  Portugal reports new measures directly and indirectly targeting marine litter. In addition, the only direct measure mentions some sources, such as fisheries, shipping and port operations as a source of marine litter. This information suggests that Portugal makes an effort and tries to address this subregional pressure at least in some aspects (even though most of the measures defined by Portugal only have indirect impacts). Microplastic is, however, a pressure that has not been reported by Portugal and for which there is no direct measure. Portugal’s D10 PoM therefore addresses the pressure. However, it should be mentioned that, even though Portugal does not report tourism and does not define measures on this activity, it is considered as an important source of litter in this area, which the Member State does not properly address.

At the subregional level, Spain and France indicate that fisheries, aquaculture, shipping and urban activities are potential sources of marine litter in the Bay of Biscay, while fisheries, shipping, urban and tourism/recreational activities are mentioned for Macaronesia. Portugal is likely to cover some but not all of these pressures/activities through its measures, despite not referring to them explicitly. No measures are identified for aquaculture, urban activities and tourism, which is a gap. 

At the regional level, the Portuguese PoM addresses, to some extent, OSPAR’s objective of substantially reducing ‘marine litter in the OSPAR maritime area to levels where properties and quantities do not cause harm to the marine environment’. Indeed, some of the measures focus specifically on the reduction of marine litter.
";The measures partially address the relevant pressures and activities. Although Portugal admits the presence of marine litter in its coast and marine areas (in Bay of Biscay and Macaronesia), it does not clearly associate it with a specific activity in its Article 8. Some of the measures are D10-specific and a few mention specific human activities as possible sources of litter (fisheries, port operations and shipping). Therefore, the measures address some aspects of marine litter. However, additional relevant human activities such as urban activities and tourism are not addressed. Microlitter is not addressed.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/36a0e5b8-8ce3-47f5-a227-de86e8337983/details
PT ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Portugal has a general, non-quantitative definition of GES for D10 stating that ‘GES can be achieved if the quantity of marine litter and the resulting disaggregated and degraded products present in the marine and coastal environment correspond to levels that do not present risk for the coastal and marine environment’. 

Based upon the available information, it cannot be evaluated if the PoM addresses the GES definition. In addition, the measures are mainly focused on increasing knowledge rather than on direct reduction of marine litter (e.g. no such measures for the Bay of Biscay). 

Among the Madeira-related targets, only no.8 seems to be D10-specific. These targets deal with marine litter in general terms and there is no distinction made between the micro and macro litter (although they most likely refer to the macro-litter). They have been formulated as trends and it is impossible to measure the actual contribution of the measures towards them. The links between the new measures and the targets are sometimes indicated although it is not always clear, and the interpretation of targets and measure definitions does not allow for a conclusion to be drawn on whether or not all targets are addressed. Indeed, for example, measure ME02-D10 is linked to Cont.6, which aims at decreasing, by 2020, the level of marine litter at selected beaches, compared to the level of marine litter in 2014. However, it is difficult to understand how an indirect measure that plans to fill knowledge gaps (database on marine litter) could decrease the level of marine litter. Moreover, there are uncertainties regarding the coverage of the Cont.7, Cont.12, Azo.16 and Mad.8 targets.";The measures partially address GES and targets. Portugal focuses on monitoring and research activities to assess if marine litter is a pressure on its marine waters, in line with its target definitions, except for one measure that will directly contribute to decrease the pressure. While the measures will help to establish smarter GES and targets in the future, and the operational measures will contribute towards reducing trends in litter, it is not clear how GES is expected to be achieved with these measures. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/36a0e5b8-8ce3-47f5-a227-de86e8337983/details

PT ;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Portugal does not report pressures associated with D11 (underwater noise or other energy input). The measures developed by Portugal allow for underwater noise only to be indirectly addressed (one new measure is D11-specific). Indeed, one new measure focuses on studies and the development of a monitoring programme, while another one aims to fill knowledge gaps and monitor the meteorological conditions. Other measures are horizontal and have impacts on D11, even though they have not been created specifically for this aim. While the reported measures do not yet directly address any pressures, they contribute to better characterising pressures, understanding risks and defining thresholds at the EU/subdivisional level. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the pressure.   

At the subregional level, France and Spain both identified underwater noise as a pressure in their Article 8. The human activities reported by both countries as relevant in Bay of Biscay and Macaronesia are shipping and marine research (although France and Spain also reported other activities). Portugal does not address these issues, or at best only indirectly.

At the regional level, OSPAR provides more details about the problem of underwater noise, which is one of its work areas. It explains that this pressure can come from diverse human activities (offshore construction, shipping, sand and gravel extraction, drilling). Portugal takes some steps towards addressing the pressures and activities highlighted by OSPAR, but only to a certain extent (few general activities and no specific activities are targeted).";Portugal does not report any pressure associated with D11 and therefore lists no related activities in its Article 8. On the other hand, its PoM includes one D11-specific indirect measure, two other new indirect measures that are also relevant for other descriptors and eight horizontal new measures that can be linked to D11. While the reported measures do not yet directly address any pressures, they contribute to better characterising pressures, understanding risks and defining thresholds at the EU/subdivisional level.

PT ;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The GES definition of Portugal is extremely broad, valid only for the continental and Madeira subregions (not the Azores) and repeats the targets of D11 (GES is achieved when the introduction of energy, including underwater noise, is at levels that do not adversely affect the marine environment). The CAASPER project will help to collect information that can better inform GES. The horizontal measures might indirectly lead to a better management of noise emissions and thus help achieve GES. However, the GES is so general that no further conclusions can be drawn.

Portugal has identified seven targets for D11 (target 14 associated with the Mainland/Continent, targets 17 and 18 for the Azores subdivision and targets 11 and 4 for the Madeira subdivision, although target 4 is not D11 specific). Most, if not all, targets are actually actions to collect more information on D11 and/or to provide the infrastructure for a noise monitoring system.

RO ;BLK ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Romania identified the introduction of NIS as a relevant pressure on its marine environment and reported shipping as the main pathway for NIS introductions. In its PoM, Romania confirms that this is the main activity leading to the introduction of NIS into the marine environment. One of the new measures (RO-MN-011) specifically covers this activity. Another measure also indirectly covers shipping, through monitoring efforts (RO-ME-014). Other existing measures cover additional potential pathways for NIS introductions, such as fisheries or aquaculture. 

Several horizontal measures are also relevant in addressing aquaculture. RO-ME-035 requires an environmental permit to be obtained for public or private projects or for modifying or expanding existing activities, for decommissioning projects, including within protected marine areas, which may have a significant impact on the marine environment. RO-ME-036 specifies that the development of existing activities, as well as the start of new activities with a possible significant impact on the environment, including within protected marine areas, are carried out only having obtained an integrated environmental permit/authorisation. These horizontal measures can be relevant, as aquaculture could have a significant impact on the marine environment through the potential introduction of NIS. 

The PoM therefore addresses the relevant pressures and activities. 

In the Black Sea, Bulgaria identified shipping and aquaculture (fin-fish and shellfish) as pathways for NIS introductions. These are both covered by Romania’s measures (e.g. RO-MN-011 for shipping and RO-ME-011 for aquaculture).

At the regional level, one of the Bucharest Convention’s policy actions addresses the threat from the introduction of non-indigenous species. The Black Sea biodiversity and landscape conservation Protocol to the Convention of the protection of the Black Sea against pollution requires measures to regulate intentional species introductions and prevent accidental introductions of NIS and genetically-modified organisms. The contracting parties should also endeavour to implement all suitable measures to eradicate or reduce NIS which have harmful impacts on the environment. Romania’s PoM, in particular measures RO-ME-012 and RO-ME-013, focus on the deliberate introduction of NIS.

RO ;BLK ;13;D3;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Romania reported the pressure ‘extraction of species, fish and shellfish’ as relevant for its waters, listing the activities of fisheries (including recreational fishing), and especially vessels larger than 12m with mobile, seabed-affecting gears, as contributors to this pressure. 
Romania’s PoM addresses commercial fisheries through the implementation of the CFP and related regulations. All existing measures address commercial fishing via gear restrictions, prohibition on gear types or geographical limitations of gear use, vessel requirements and regulation of quotas and landing. 
Some of the new and completely new measures (e.g. RO-MN-017, RO-MN-018 and RO-MN-019) also address commercial fishing through the development of multi-annual regional management plans and definition and reassessment of periods and areas of prohibition. 
An additional measure develops monitoring efforts: RO-ME-021 requires that all fishing vessels with a length of 12m or more shall be equipped with a satellite monitoring system (VMS), which indirectly addresses the pressures.
Romania established measures to encourage small-scale coastal fishing (vessels smaller than 12m: RO-MN-014). 
The measures reported by Romania do not explicitly refer to recreational fishing. Measure RO-ME-020, which suggests the annual determination of fishing periods and areas for prohibition, as well as areas for the protection of living aquatic resources, based on a proposal by ANPA and by order of the Minister, is likely to also apply to recreational fishing.

In the Black Sea, Bulgaria also identified ‘fisheries’ as an underlying cause of the pressure ‘extraction of species’. The activity is covered by Romania’s measures. 

At the regional level, Romania cooperates with Bulgaria and non-EU countries to achieve GES by 2020, under the Bucharest Convention. Cooperation between Romania and Bulgaria was enhanced under the project ‘Administrative and technical support for MSFD implementation in Bulgaria and Romania –Phase I, II and III'. This indicates that Romania collaborates within the framework of regional sea conventions (RSCs) to apply a regionally coherent policy. It should be noted, however, that Romania’s D3 measures do not mention the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), the regional fisheries management organisation for the Mediterranean Sea, including the Black Sea.";The measures address the pressures and relevant activities. The measures cover commercial fisheries, including for vessels larger than 12m, as per its Article 8 reporting.

RO ;BLK ;13;D3;Coverage of GES and targets ;"GES is reached when ‘the level of fishing pressure and reproduction capabilities are at those levels set out in the environmental targets to sustain MSY for a long-term period of some relevant key fish species (sprat, turbot, whiting, horse mackerel, anchovy, dogfish, red mullet)’. 

Various measures address fishing effort (e.g. RO-ME-017, on the establishment of criteria for the allocation of commercial fishing rights in natural habitats), reproduction capabilities (e.g. RO-ME-019, regulating that fish specimens of sizes below the minimum regulated limit may not be retained, trans-shipped, landed or marketed, and must be returned to the marine environment as soon as captured, irrespective of their state) and MSY (e.g. RO-MN-091, defining and revising the prohibition periods and areas of fish population). Existing measures under the CFP and national legislation address sustainable exploitation. Therefore, the measures address the GES definition. 

Romania defines three targets for D3: level of pressure of the fishing activity (3.1), reproductive capacity of the stock (3.2), and population age and size distribution (3.3). Several existing measures can contribute to controlling fishing effort, i.e. target 3.1. This includes catch prohibitions, temporary closures, gear specifications, prohibited gears and minimum sizes (ME-005, ME-006, ME-016, ME-019). In addition, the new measures focus on the development and implementation of action plans for target species management (MN-017), improved control of turbot gill nets (MN-018) and revising spatial and temporal fishing restrictions (MN-019).

The reproductive capacity of the stock (3.2) is addressed by RO-ME-015, establishing certain requirements for vessels holding turbot-fishing permits in relation to fishing areas/quotas allocated, landing of fish, and use of tools, as well as RO-ME-019, regulating that fish specimens of sizes below the minimum regulated limit may not be retained, trans-shipped, landed or marketed, and must be returned to the aquatic environment as soon as captured, irrespective of their state. 
The element of population age and size distribution (3.3) is addressed specifically through some size-based measures, e.g. improved selectivity (ME-005, MN-014), gear-related measures (ME-015, MN-018), minimum size regulations (ME-019), and spatio-temporal closures (which may be used to protect juvenile aggregations) (ME-020, MN-019). Multi-annual plans may also address age/size distribution (MN-017).
The targets relate to seven commercially exploited species; all of which are specifically mentioned in various measures (Romania’s GES definition refers to the key species sprat, turbot, whiting, horse mackerel, anchovy, dogfish, red mullet). Overall, the existing and new measures address these aspects for the seven species specified. For the two species managed through Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and quota (sprat and turbot), GES should be achieved through the CFP and associated measures. For the other species, Romania reports a range of relevant measures (as well as measures relating to sprat and turbot).
";The measures address the GES and target definitions. GES is covered because fishing effort, stock biomass, and gear restrictions supporting age/size structure are addressed in the PoM. The targets are mainly addressed by existing European fisheries legislation (on capacity and effort management, catch limits, gear restrictions, and discards).

In the Black Sea, Romania’s neighbouring Member State – Bulgaria – identified the same activities as contributing to nutrient enrichment. Pressures are therefore addressed. 
At the regional level, the ʽStrategic Action Plan for the rehabilitation and protection of the Black Sea’ (2009) explains that the Black Sea ecosystem continues to be threatened by inputs of certain pollutants, notably nutrients from land-based sources, particularly through rivers.

RO ;BLK ;13;D5;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Romania’s GES definition for D5, nutrient concentrations should not lead to an undesirable disturbance in the balance of organisms present in the water or to the quality of the water concerned as a result of accelerated growth of algae, i.e. direct and indirect effects. It then further defines those effects. Romania defined eight environmental targets in the form of quantitative thresholds and ratios for nutrient concentrations, together with quantitative targets for direct and indirect impacts.

GES and targets both refer to nutrient levels and direct/indirect effects of nutrient enrichment. Thus, the measures appear to contribute to achieve GES and targets as they aim to reduce the input of nutrients to the sea. For example, RO-ME-023, RO-ME-024 and RO-ME-025 will contribute to the reduction of discharges of untreated urban waste water to the marine environment, while RO-ME-030, RO-ME-033 and RO-ME-034 will contribute to the reduction of ship-generated waste and/or cargo residue. However, insufficient information is provided as to whether the target nutrient ratio threshold will be maintained/achieved with these measures. The direct and indirect effect thresholds should automatically be achieved by meeting the nutrient concentration thresholds.

In the Black Sea, Bulgaria reported ‘other marine uses and activities’. Although it is unclear what precisely is included here, as explained above, the Romanian measures would likely cover any activity with significant impacts on the marine environment. 

At regional level, the Bucharest Convention refers to the discharge of waste containing potentially harmful substances and its possible impact on hydrographical conditions.

RO ;BLK ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Romania identified the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, and accidental pollution as pressures within its waters. For the first two, marine hydrocarbon extraction, industry, urban, shipping and solid waste disposal were highlighted as activities causing these pressures. All of these activities (apart from hydrocarbon extraction) are covered by several measures here. Solid waste disposal is targeted by a single measure and only covers the collection of solid waste at bathing waters. In addition, several measures cover agriculture and port operations. For accidental pollution, Romania identified industry, urban and shipping as relevant activities. Only shipping is clearly addressed by the measures defined for D8. Industry and shipping are however likely to be covered by measures addressing these same activities as sources of contaminants. Two measures also cover port operations.

The other Member State in the Black Sea, Bulgaria, reported industry, agriculture and urban activities as the main sources of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds, and industry, port operations and shipping as activities risking accidental pollution. Of these, Romania’s PoM covers all activities, except those relating to industry causing accidental pollution.  

At the regional level, Article VI of the Bucharest Convention addresses pollution by hazardous substances and matter: ‘shall prevent pollution of the marine environment of the Black Sea from any source by substances or matter specified in the Annex to this Convention’, while Article XIV is associated with the hazardous wastes in transboundary movement: ‘The contracting parties shall take all measures consistent with international law and cooperate in the prevention of pollution of the marine environment of the Black Sea due to hazardous wastes in transboundary movement, as well as in combatting illegal traffic thereof, in accordance with the Protocol to be adopted by them’. More precisely, a list of hazardous substances was provided, based on their toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. This list includes both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds (mercury, cadmium, leads, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organophosphates), as well as radioactive elements. Although a list of noxious substances is provided, no list of potential activities that could lead to the release of such substances was provided. Pollution is also the subject of two chapters within the ‘State of Environment report 2001-2006/7’ published by the Commission on the protection of the Black Sea against pollution. Finally, the Strategic Action Plan for the rehabilitation and protection of the Black Sea explains that the input of several harmful substances (e.g. oil) still threatens the Black Sea ecosystem. These substances can reach the environment as a result of accidental and operational discharges from ships, as well as through land-based sources (half of the oil inputs from land-based activities are brought to the Black Sea through the River Danube). Romania addresses several of these concerns through its measures: oil pollution is addressed by including indicators for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in several measures; land-based sources such as urban waste water and agricultural runoff are covered; and collaboration with Bulgaria on transboundary aspects is in place. ";The measures partially address the pressures and activities reported under Article 8. Industry, urban, shipping, and solid waste disposal reported as sources of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds are addressed, while marine hydrocarbon extraction is not. Shipping, reported as a source of accidental pollution, is covered by the measures, but industry and urban are not. These are however likely to be covered by measures addressing these same activities as sources of contaminants (this cannot be confirmed from the information provided).

Romania has reported one target (8.1.1) for D8, which focuses on the concentration of several contaminants measured in the appropriate matrix (bioceonosis, sediment, water) that should be comparable to assessments made under the WFD (75% of the concentrations of heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and synthetic compounds in the three matrices should be lower than the levels at which adverse effects are expected to occur). The target relates to the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (EQSD), whose list of hazardous substances also includes contaminants than the three groups listed by Romania. Even though the target is referenced in the description of nearly all measures, there is little by way of specifying how the measures will help to achieve the concentration levels indicated for the various types of pollutants.

The measures defined partially address GES and target definitions. As these definitions are quite broad, any measure which leads to decreased levels of contaminants will contribute to the achievement of both the target and GES. Many measures are linked to existing policies (UWWTD, WFD, Nitrates Directive, MARPOL and others) which should further ensure that GES is addressed.

RO ;BLK ;13;D9;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The GES definition for D9 focuses on the concentrations of contaminants (heavy metals, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls and PAH) in seafood (fish and molluscs) caught in the natural environment and implies that these should not affect the safety of food consumption, without any further specifics. 

Romania has defined two targets for D9: target 9.1.1 focuses on the levels of heavy metals, PCBs, organochlorine pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fish and shellfish for human consumption that should not exceed threshold values laid down by the Foodstuffs Regulation (1881/2006/EC) or national legislation; and target 9.1.2 requires that no more than 25% and 5% of all samples investigated in a year exceed the regulated levels for heavy metals and the sum of PCBs, PAHs and organochlorine pesticides, respectively (the Foodstuffs Regulation and national legislation are mentioned in connection with this target).

RO ;BLK ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Romania identified marine litter as a pressure on its marine water due to fisheries, tourism and recreational activities, and shipping. The measures reported address all of these activities. The measure targeting fisheries (RO-MN-M026) covers litter generated by any kind of source, as it addresses litter accidentally caught in fishing gear. It does not necessarily decrease the litter generated by the fishing activity itself (such as ghost nets). The measures also cover port operations and various other activities. Although Romania did not identify the pressure of micro-plastics, RO-MN-027 contributes to decreasing the creation of secondary micro-plastics by reducing plastic waste accumulation. It should still be noted that, even though Romania recognizes that the Danube River has an important influence on the ecological status of the Black Sea marine ecosystem, no measure reported under D10 focuses on the Danube. This is a gap in the Romanian marine strategy regarding marine litter.

In the Black Sea, Bulgaria similarly reported marine litter as a pressure generated by fisheries, urban activities and shipping. Of these, the measures reported by Romania mainly address shipping and fisheries. Urban activities are only indirectly targeted by RO-MN-025 which aims to increase all economic operators’ understanding of the negative effects of introducing waste into the marine environment, but no detailed waste management or waste water treatment plan for land-based activities could be found among Romania’s measures for D10. 

At the regional level, the Bucharest Convention published a report in 2009, linking marine litter to the broader problem of unsatisfactory solid waste management in the region in general, and highlighting the lack of understanding of the concept of marine litter among the Black Sea community. The report recommended eight actions to be included in the subsequent action plan. These actions relate to improving national waste management policies as well as legal and administrative instruments, developing assessment and monitoring schemes, reducing and preventing pollution, raising awareness, strengthening public/private partnerships, implementing best available technologies, and improving professional skills for management of marine litter. The Strategic Action Plan for the Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation of the Black Sea (2009) itself does not point out marine litter as a prioritised area, but nevertheless includes two actions relevant for this topic: to amend national waste strategies and/or national coastal zone management plans with the aim of minimising coastal and marine litter, and to develop regional and national marine litter monitoring and assessment methodologies on the basis of common research approaches, evaluation criteria and reporting requirements. It should also be noted that a Regional Action Plan on the management of marine litter in the Black Sea has been adopted in October 2018. Of the regional actions described, Romania’s PoM addresses awareness-raising and reducing pollution (mainly from ships, fisheries and tourism). Explicit reference to the Bucharest Convention is made in RO-MN-021, RO-MN-024 and RO-MN-025. Finally, Romania’s PoM calls for regional implementation of measures against marine litter in general, in light of the transboundary nature of the problem.";The measures address all reported pressures and activities, i.e. fisheries, tourism, and shipping. In addition, they address the pressure ‘micro-plastics’ and the activities relating to port operations. It should still be noted that, even though Romania recognizes that the Danube River has an important influence on the ecological status of the Black Sea marine ecosystem, no measure reported under D10 focuses on the Danube. This is a gap in the Romanian marine strategy regarding marine litter.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/f3670bc6-401e-42b1-b8c8-facd3eb5357b/details
RO ;BLK ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"GES for marine litter (D10) is achieved ‘when impacts of marine wastes and their decomposition products are reduced and cease to produce harmful effects on the marine and coastal environment’.

The GES definition is very broad, and any measure which improves the situation will contribute to meeting this definition. However, this should not be confused with fully achieving GES.

Romania identified the following targets as relevant for D10:
•	The downward trend in the amount of marine waste brought and/or deposited on shore. 
•	The decreasing trend of the quantity of marine waste in the water column and deposited on the seabed. 
•	Reducing the number of recorded cases in the presence of marine litter in the digestive system of marine organisms

The direct measures in Romania’s PoM mainly focus on waste generated on ships or in bathing areas, which is in line with the two first targets but omits other sources and could indirectly address the third target. Although some measures (MN-025 and MN-027) have been linked to the last target, these measures seem to only have indirect impacts on the achievement of this target. It is therefore not clear whether or not this target will be fully addressed. The targets are therefore partially addressed. 

While the GES definition includes both marine macro-litter and its degradation products (micro-litter), the targets do not explicitly include micro-plastics. The targets could include both micro- and macro-litter, but the information provided does not specify whether or not this is the case. The measures focus on macro-litter, but degradation products (e.g. micro-plastics) are also considered to some extent (measure RO-MN-027).

It can be concluded that Romania’s PoM partially addresses the defined GES and targets.";The measures partially address the GES and targets. The GES definition is very broad and the targets only refer to decreasing the amount of litter (including in the digestive system of marine organisms), which means that all measures aiming to reduce the levels of litter in the sea and along the coast will contribute to Romania’s GES and target definitions. Still, this should not be confused with fully achieving GES. Also, the targets are partially addressed by the measures, since they are not fully addressed in all different aspects (e.g., the measures omit some sources of litter).;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/f3670bc6-401e-42b1-b8c8-facd3eb5357b/details

Romania reports that information on marine litter, especially micro-plastics, remains limited, which hinders the assessment of status and the identification of suitable measures. It states that efforts will be undertaken to increase the knowledge base, especially regarding the amount of litter originating from other countries. Based on this, the PoM (including the exceptions) will be updated after the approval and implementation of the Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter Management for the Black Sea (adopted on 24-25 October 2018) and the Guidelines for Marine Litter Monitoring in the Black Sea. Nevertheless, Romania does not report whether or not it has identified (or even quantified) the amount of litter coming from neighbouring Member States through monitoring efforts, which would represent the basis of such exception.

Still, it reported one measure (RO-MN-028) that has both direct and indirect impacts on the pressure and that covers tourism, fishing and shipping (as well as port operations to some extent). Romania also reports another measure (RO-MN-029) that only has indirect impacts and is linked to ‘all activities at sea’ (although the register only concerns impulsive noise). While this measure does not yet directly address any pressures, it contributes to better characterising pressures, understanding risks and defining action plans. 

Bulgaria (the only other EU Member State in the Black Sea) reported marine hydrocarbon extraction, dredging, land claim/coastal defence, port operations, defence operations, tourism and shipping as relevant sources of underwater noise in the Black Sea in its Article 8 report. Some of these activities are directly covered in Romania’s PoM, while others are only indirectly covered. Dredging and land claim/coastal defence, however, do not seem to be addressed. Therefore, the PoM partially addresses the pressure.

SE ;BAL ;13;D3;Coverage of pressures ;"Sweden addresses the pressure extraction of species caused by fishing activities through the existing and new measures of its PoM. This reflects its Article 8 reporting, in which it identified fisheries’ activities as a relevant cause of the pressure extraction of species, fish and shellfish in both subregions.

Despite including tourism and recreational activities as causes of the pressure extraction of species, fish and shellfish in both subregions in its Article 8 report, Sweden’s PoM contains no measures related to these activities. However, it is likely that ‘tourism and recreational activities’ referred to recreational fishing, which is covered by the activity ‘fisheries including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish)’, and is addressed by many of the new measures. For example, M004, M006, M007 and M008 apply to both commercial and recreational fishing. As such, relevant pressures and activities are addressed through the reported PoM.
 
At the subregional level in the North Sea, all neighbouring Member States have identified fisheries, including recreational fishing (fish and shellfish), as a key activity causing the pressure extraction of species (fish and shellfish). Given that Sweden has identified this activity as a relevant pressure and its PoM includes measures to address this pressure, it is in line with its neighbours in respect of D3. 

At the regional level, OSPAR does not identify pressures related to commercial fishing (other than indirectly, through its impacts on biological diversity and healthy ecosystems), as fisheries are beyond the remit of its work. This prevents comparisons with regional pressures and priorities in the context of this descriptor.

SE ;BAL ;13;D3;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Sweden links its GES and targets to fishing mortality (F), Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), fish biomass, Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) and age and size structure. Fishing mortality, MSY and SSB (and fish biomass) for the main commercial species are likely to be covered by Sweden’s implementation of the CFP. Age and size structure is referred to in several of the new measures (M004–M008), predominantly in relation to management of coastal stocks. Based on the reported information, there are some unclarities whether age and size structure will be covered by national legislation for CFP stocks. 

The three aspects of GES appear to be covered for coastal (national) species. Existing measures already establish protected areas for salmon and trout during spawning periods, and new measures M004–M008 specifically focus on improving protection for coastal species. 

Targets C3 and C4 are covered in relation to population size and fishing mortality for CFP and national/coastal stocks, with age and size structure for such stocks specifically addressed by many of the new measures. For offshore stocks, however, it is not clear if aspects of age and size structure are adequately addressed, as this is not a focus of the CFP, which is the main measure for delivery of D3 for many stocks. However, measures to achieve CFP goals of fishing mortality and SSB in line with MSY are likely to contribute to age/size structure of populations. Overall, therefore, measures are likely to address D3 targets. ";"The measures partially address D3 GES and targets. They address fishing mortality (F) and SSB for CFP stocks.

SE ;BAL ;13;D5;Coverage of pressures ;"As the new measures largely comprise research and financial support, the D5 pressures and activities are mainly addressed by the existing measures. Sweden does not report the activities targeted by these measures. 

At the regional level, within the Baltic Sea, in its Article 8 report, Sweden includes agriculture, industry and urban activities as relevant for the pressure nutrient enrichment. All other Baltic Sea Member States have also reported agriculture and urban activities as relevant. Even though Sweden reports little information about its existing WFD measures, it is likely that these will include measures to address industrial, urban and agricultural activities. 

To further reduce atmospheric nitrogen deposition from ships, Sweden has negotiated an agreement for the Baltic and North Seas to be designated as so-called NECA areas, for adoption by the IMO. This involves the imposition of more stringent NOx emission thresholds for shipping. Atmospheric nitrogen deposits from ships will presumably account for the reported ‘Other marine uses’ as a eutrophication pressure. However, Sweden reports insufficient information to confirm this assumption. 

Most coastal North Sea countries identify agriculture and urban activities as being most relevant to eutrophication, a position recognised by Sweden. As stated above for the Baltic Sea, agricultural and urban activities are likely to be addressed by measures under the WFD. Aspects of agriculture are also dealt with under the Industrial Emissions Directive, which is referred to directly under existing measures. 

As Sweden does not specify the activities covered by its WFD measures, the PoM measures can be considered partially covering D5 pressures, although it is likely that most relevant human activities are addressed by the reported measures.

According to HELCOM, inputs of nutrients stem from agricultural, forestry and aquaculture activities, restructuring of seabed morphology (dredging), shipping, land transport, urban and industrial uses. Most of these activities are likely to be addressed via the measures, but given the lack of information this cannot be verified. OSPAR does not identify specific pressures related to eutrophication, referring mainly to its impacts; as such, a comparison with regional pressures and priorities cannot be made in the context of this descriptor. ";The new measures will mainly address indirect impacts on the marine environment, as they are research and financing measures. Pressures are therefore addressed by the existing measures. Existing measures under the WFD and the Industrial Emissions Directive will very likely contribute to reducing nutrient inputs to the marine environment from urban and agricultural activities, although it is not clear whether and how other sources of nutrient input will be addressed. As Sweden does not clearly specify the activities covered by its WFD measures, the PoM measures can be considered partially covering relevant MSFD pressures, pending the WFD assessment results. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b9effcdc-1776-4be0-8176-e5c32f6495c1/details
SE ;BAL ;13;D5;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Sweden’s definition, D5 GES is achieved when anthropogenic eutrophication is reduced, as is its impact on the marine environment. Threshold levels are provided for nutrients, chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen concentrations, phytoplankton biovolume and water transparency/turbidity. In addition, the depth distribution of benthic macrophytes is at least equal to WFD good status. 

Sweden has one D5 target linked to the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the marine environment as a result of nutrient input from human activity, stating that these will not cause adverse effects on biodiversity and ecosystems. The associated indicators are nutrient loads and levels, chlorophyll concentrations and water clarity. 

Both the GES definition and target for D5 are dependent either on nutrient loads to the marine environment or nutrient concentrations with the sea itself; all other indicators are metrics of either direct or indirect impacts of elevated nutrient levels. The new and existing measures are all aimed at reducing nutrient loads to the sea from internal and external sources, and nutrient levels within the sea itself. The PoM therefore addresses GES and targets, despite the fact that the main sources of nutrient input are not clearly identifiable.

SE ;BAL ;14;D5;Exceptions ;"Sweden applies one exception for D5. It applies Article 14 (1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’. The Member State reports that even if nutrient discharges are currently within the acceptable limits, natural conditions will cause the recovery time towards achieving GES to be long. This is partly due to a slow turnover of waters in the Baltic and some areas in the North Sea. It will also take a while until direct and indirect eutrophication impacts will cease. Therefore, Sweden estimates that it will take more than 100 years for the pressure of eutrophication in its waters to be non-existent. As clarified by the Member State, this estimation is based on a HELCOM model used as a basis for the BSAP. It refers to the time it will take to reach GES after actions are taken on land. Sweden reports that within a decade, improvements in some eutrophication variables will become measurable, however, that GES will be reached within a century. Sweden states that measure M010 aims to assess possibilities to address internal loads.

The justifications are grounded, as turnover rates in the Baltic and parts of the North Sea are slow indeed and historical contamination is major. Hence, a reduction in nutrient influx will only reduce eutrophication effects over time.  ";Sweden applies an exception for D5. It applies Article 14 (1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’. It states that even if the nutrient load targets are reached, recovery of the state of the marine environment will take a long time because the concentrations in marine waters can persist for a very long time.

While no specific activity is pinpointed by most of the countries in these subregions, ‘marine-based renewable energy generation’ in the North Sea is reported by three countries, while ‘Placement and operation of offshore structures’ and ‘Tourism/recreational activities’ in the Baltic Sea are reported by two countries. Some Member States also report marine acidification as a relevant pressure associated with D7. This is mainly associated with ‘industry’ in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Sweden does not seem to address these activities in its D7-related measures.

The measures reported cover all pressures, as all projects which could adversely impact hydrological conditions are to be submitted to the existing regulatory procedures. OSPAR and HELCOM identify D7-related pressures associated with the offshore economy and maritime activities respectively, and Sweden contributes to addressing these issues with its D7 measures.";Sweden did not previously report hydrographical changes (D7) as a pressure in its marine waters (in either of its subregions). It does, however, define existing and new measures to tackle this issue. One of the new measures particularly targets urban activities. Sweden’s PoM addresses the relevant pressures. It is not clear if cumulative impacts are addressed.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b9effcdc-1776-4be0-8176-e5c32f6495c1/details
SE ;BAL ;13;D7;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The Swedish GES definition for D7 ensures that permanent alterations of the hydrographical conditions through individual or cumulative activities are not of such nature or magnitude as to adversely affect the ecosystem (particularly changes in temperature and salinity as a result of large-scale projects), and the impact on habitats as a result of permanent hydrographical alterations does not adversely affect habitat distribution or the long-term survival of associated species and communities. Sweden’s PoM addresses all components of the GES definition for D7.

Sweden defines one target associated with D7: permanent changes in hydrographic conditions due to large-scale activities, alone or in combination, may not negatively affect biodiversity and the ecosystem. It is associated with three descriptors (area affected by permanent changes in hydrographic conditions, surface area and volume affected by planned and implemented large-scale projects, temperature and salinity used as an indicator to detect changes in hydrographic conditions resulting from large-scale projects). This assessment finds that the target is addressed by the existing measures (mainly WFD KTMs and SEA/EIA), together with the new ones (preparation of guidance for the impact assessment of hydrological changes on biodiversity (M013) and adaptation of coastal and municipal plans (M014)).";The measures address GES and targets through existing measures linked to the WFD and SEA/EIA implementation, in addition to new measures to prepare guidance for the impact assessment of hydrological changes on biodiversity, and adaptation of coastal and municipal plans where most projects are expected to take place.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b9effcdc-1776-4be0-8176-e5c32f6495c1/details

Shipping is also highlighted as the main source of accidental pollution in both subregions. In terms of pressures, Sweden clearly defines measures against the introduction of hazardous compounds (at least synthetic and non-synthetic, although the lack of information makes it uncertain whether or not radio-nuclides are also included) and at least one of the existing measures includes actions against accidental pollution (REACH). As far as the activities are concerned, the PoM for D8 and D9 covers all of the activities mentioned, with the exception of agriculture, despite its inclusion by Sweden in its Article 8 reporting. While an existing measure seems to address accidental pollution, no specific related activity is reported. Despite also being unspecified, one of Sweden’s new measures (M016) addresses contaminated sediments, allowing for an assessment that the D8 and D9 measures partially address the reported pressures and activities. Given the lack of detail provided for existing measures, however, some activities (and even pressures) might have been excluded here. 

At the subregional level, other Baltic Sea Member States have pointed to ‘industry’ as a key source of synthetic compounds, ‘industry’ and ‘urban’ as activities that lead to the release of non-synthetic compounds, quite diverse activities associated with radio-nuclides, and ‘shipping’ as responsible for accidental pollution. Sweden covers these activities. In the North Sea, the Member States mainly report ‘industry’ and ‘shipping’ as sources of contaminants and accidental pollution. Sweden also covers these activities.

At the regional level, the measures for D8 and D9 are in line with HELCOM’s objective on hazardous substances: concentrations of hazardous substances close to natural levels, all fish are safe to eat, healthy wildlife and radioactivity at the pre-Chernobyl level. The measures focus on both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. They also target several human activities that contribute to the release of these compounds in the Baltic Sea. This is also in line with OSPAR’s objective to ‘prevent pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions, and losses of hazardous substances, with the aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances’.

SE ;BAL ;13;D8 ;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Sweden provides a general definition of GES for D8: ‘Concentrations of hazardous substances are at levels not giving rise to pollution effects’. This definition is divided into two criteria, one relating to the concentration of hazardous substances, and the other to the potential impact of these compounds. These criteria are also further developed. For the first criterion, mercury and HCB should have a concentration below an agreed-upon EU standard, and there should be no increasing trends in hazardous substances in fish, mussels and guillemot eggs. For the second criterion, the frequency of seal pregnancy must be maintained and the number of detected illegal discharges per flight hours should decrease (for the Baltic Sea, two further sub-criteria have been defined for the characteristics and productivity of the white-tailed eagle). For D9, GES focuses on keeping the concentration of contaminants in fish and other seafood for human consumption below the thresholds specified in Regulation 1881/2006. 

Based on the information reported by Sweden, it is likely that the measures will support the achievement of GES, as the criteria for both D8 and D9 are addressed by the measures.

SE ;BAL ;14;D8 ;Exceptions ;"Sweden applies one exception for D8, Article 14 (1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’. It reports that there is a basic concern that some targets will not be achieved by 2020 for several reasons:

•	Firstly, a proportion of the contamination of Swedish waters results from airborne contamination, which cannot be identified by Sweden alone . Here, it makes a distinction between the presence of ubiquitous chemicals from transboundary sources and other substances that are elevated due to local activities. 
•	Secondly, it states that even if contaminant levels are low, due to the low water turnover in most of Sweden’s waters, it will take a significant time before positive results can be measured and effects will be noticeable (as described for the D5 exception). 
•	This is further complicated by the fact that some targeted substances are persistent (e.g. dioxins and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS), or do not break down (e.g. Mercury and Cadmium). 
•	For contaminated sediment remediation measures in particular, Sweden states that these processes are technically complicated, take time and require considerable resources. 

This assessment finds that the justification provided for non-achievement of GES is grounded. Indeed, certain substances are persistent and transboundary aspects play a role in the introduction of certain contaminants. Nevertheless, no ad-hoc measures are reported in connection to this exception.";"Sweden applies an exception for D8; Article 14 (1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’.

SE ;BAL ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"Sweden reports tourism, fisheries and shipping as sources contributing to the pressure of ‘marine litter’ in both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It does not report ‘micro-litter’ as a relevant pressure in its marine environment (North Sea and Baltic Sea). The existing and new measures address the pressure ’marine litter’ and cover diverse human activity, including shipping. No measure seems to cover tourism activities, although some measures can be seen to target awareness raising and beach cleaning, making it possible that tourists and beach users are also targeted. Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to say that Sweden has put in place measures to specifically target tourism or recreational activities. Some measures particularly target micro-litter and other activities such as fisheries (e.g. lost fishing gear). Sweden’s D10 PoM is therefore partially address the reported pressures and activities.

At the subregional level in the Baltic Sea, neighbouring Member States have identified tourism as the main source of marine litter. In the North Sea, fisheries, tourism and shipping have been mentioned as activities contributing to marine litter. Sweden partially covers these pressures/activities through its measures (as outlined above, an uncertainty remains in the case of tourism).  

At the regional level, Sweden’s D10 PoM addresses OSPAR’s objective to substantially reduce ‘marine litter in the OSPAR maritime area to levels where properties and quantities do not cause harm to the marine environment’. As such, the measures focus both on sea-based and land-based sources of litter, develop removal actions, and include education and outreach elements. HELCOM has developed a regional action plan against marine litter (adopted in 2015) whose aim is to significantly decrease marine litter by 2025 and to protect the coastal and marine environments. ";The measures partially address relevant pressures identified in its Article 8 reporting, and include measures targeting micro-litter. The measures address several human activities, including shipping and fisheries. It is possible that tourism and recreational activities are targeted indirectly (mainly through measures against littering), although with no specific measure focusing on tourism, this remains unclear. ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b9effcdc-1776-4be0-8176-e5c32f6495c1/details
SE ;BAL ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Sweden’s D10 GES aims to ensure that marine litter does not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment. More precisely, it aims to ensure that the amount of litter, including its degradation products, does not damage the marine environment (number of litter items on the North Sea’s beaches must decrease, as must the amount of litter on the seabed in the North Sea and Baltic Sea) and that the harmful impacts on marine organisms are reduced. Sweden mentions the existence of additional indicators still in development. In its current version, the PoM will contribute to the achievement of GES. Indeed, even though the majority of measures tackle macro litter, references have been made in some of the new measures to micro-fraction and degradation products (M020, M022, M023).

Sweden defines one target for this descriptor: ‘the marine environment shall as far as possible be free from human litter’ with two associated indicators (amount of litter on beaches following the OSPAR methodology and progress on the six so-called reference beaches; and amount of litter on the seabed linked to bottom trawling programmes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea). This target will be addressed by the measures (measures targeting for example fisheries, shipping and urban activities, and all new measures have been directly linked to the target).";The measures address GES and targets. Even though the majority of measures tackle macro litter, references are also made in some of the new measures to micro-litter (and its degradation products) and measures target various relevant activities.;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b9effcdc-1776-4be0-8176-e5c32f6495c1/details
SE ;BAL ;13;D10;Timelines ;"Timeline to achieve GES
Sweden reports that GES might not be achieved by 2020 for D10, but given knowledge gaps it cannot confirm this. Sweden explains that although the input of new litter into the marine environment has significantly decreased, a lot of older litter remains in the marine environment. This is a problem that is likely to persist in spite of measures to collect such litter. In the long-term, it is expected that the proposed measures at the regional level have the potential to reduce external sources of marine litter (i.e. from transboundary sources). The reasoning provided for the gap is assessed as grounded; while it is indeed very difficult to remove macro- and micro-litter from the open sea, regional actions nonetheless allow for the reduction of input of litter and progress towards reduced amounts of litter in the regions. 

Timeline for implementation of the PoM
Sweden does not report a timeline for the existing measures, but it does include a timeline for most of the new measures. These will be implemented by 2016 (M019, M021, M023) and 2017 (M022).

SE ;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Sweden reports shipping, marine based renewable energy generation, fisheries, placement and operation of offshore structures, defence operations and marine research and surveys as sources of underwater noise in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The existing measures indirectly address these activities through cooperation efforts and research measures which aim to build a better understanding of the pressures and close knowledge gaps. The existing measures comprise four working groups where noise is discussed at a national and international level. Shipping sound is high on the agenda in the HELCOM, OSPAR and EU working groups, and presumably also in the national reference group. The research and development projects listed as existing measures also focus mainly on shipping. The measures therefore partially address the reported pressure and related activities.

At the subregional level, in the North Sea, Member States have identified marine-based renewable energy and shipping as key activities contributing to underwater noise (they do not report anything related to other forms of energy input). In the Baltic Sea, they mainly mention shipping. Sweden indirectly covers shipping activities through its measures. The development of offshore wind farms remains very limited in Swedish waters and it can be considered negligible as a source of pressure.  

At the regional level, OSPAR aims to develop methods to assess the impact of sound on marine species and to address the cumulative effects of different sources of noise. OSPAR acknowledges the existence of many sources of underwater noise. By focusing on a limited number of these, Sweden’s PoM partially addresses OSPAR’s objective. The HELCOM Experts Network on Underwater Noise (EN-Noise) has been created to work on underwater noise in the short term (2015-2017) and the HELCOM 37 (2016) meeting has adopted the Regional Baltic Underwater Noise Roadmap 2015-2017. The roadmap recognises the potentially harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on the marine environment and its species. It also highlights piling (for impulsive noise) and shipping (for continuous noise) as the two main sources of underwater noise in the Baltic Sea (among other sources). Sweden therefore also partially addresses HELCOM’s priorities about underwater noise.";The measures partially address the pressures and activities including shipping identified in its Article 8 reporting. The reported measures will not, however, directly affect the problem of noise, as they focus on knowledge increase efforts and coordination actions. These will contribute to better understanding the descriptor.  ;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/b9effcdc-1776-4be0-8176-e5c32f6495c1/details
SE ;BAL ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"The GES associated with D11 refers to:
•	Activities that create sound levels sufficiently high to cause adverse effects on individual populations or ecosystems are limited in time and space.
•	Underwater noise from ships must not give rise to long-lasting adverse effects on biological diversity and ecosystems.
These GES components are likely to be addressed by the PoM. All four of the working groups mentioned target both GES points. The research activities have a clear focus on shipping and the establishment of a national register for noise activities will potentially cover the first element of GES. However, these measures are indirect, limiting their ability to address GES, whose scope is not restricted to closing knowledge gaps or enhancing cooperation. The measures thus partially address the GES definition. 

No D11-related targets have been defined by Sweden, making an assessment of the existing measures against the targets impossible. Sweden explains that this absence of targets is the reason it has not reported any new measures for D11. However, additional steps are required and described in the PoM. These future actions will mainly deal with research and the development of tools for management (such as monitoring) to improve knowledge on underwater noise. ";The measures partially address GES components. This is done through Sweden’s participation in working groups and research activities, which also constitute indirect measures.

SI ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Slovenia identified the introduction of NIS as a relevant pressure on its marine environment, pointing to shipping and aquaculture as contributors to the introduction and spread of NIS in its waters. Both activities are covered in the PoM by specifically targeted measures. However, it is unclear whether or not hull fouling is covered, as the measure targeting shipping activities seems to focus on ballast water only. The PoM therefore partially addresses the pressures. 

At subregional level, all Member States report aquaculture and shipping as the main pathways of NIS introduction. Italy and Croatia also report tourism and recreation as a relevant activity for NIS introduction. This activity is likely to be covered by Slovenia through measures focusing on shipping.  

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s priorities is to monitor the spread of invasive species: ‘Non‐indigenous species introduced by human activities are, to the maximum extent possible, at levels that do not adversely alter the ecosystem’ (associated with operational objectives and indicators). Slovenia’s measures reported for D2 contribute to addressing this issue.";The measures partially address the pressure of introduction of NIS.

SI ;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Slovenia, GES is achieved when NIS concentrations (as a consequence of human activities) is at levels that do not cause a negative impact on ecosystems, native species and habitats. The PoM addresses the main pathways for NIS introduction (e.g. shipping and aquaculture), and also includes research and monitoring activities to control and assess the status of NIS populations and their impacts on native ecosystems.

Slovenia reports three targets for D2. The first aims to control the vectors and pathways of NIS introduction, including a rapid response system (measure D2: TU3). The second points to specific NIS monitoring in areas most vulnerable to their introduction, such as ports. While the PoM provides a broad monitoring scheme (measure D2: TU3), there is no specific mention of port activities. Slovenia clarified that the specific activities covered by this measure would depend on the authority responsible for its implementation (which will include all relevant institutions/organizations that are needed to implement this measure) and thus the definition of monitoring criteria and indicators. The third target aims to control the already established NIS in the Adriatic sub-region and to put in place measures when an environmental impact is detected. These requirements are considered and included within the measure to develop a rapid response system (D2: TU3) and are, therefore, covered. 

Overall, the PoM addresses both GES and targets.";The measures address the GES and targets. For GES, the measures cover the two main vectors of NIS from human activities (e.g., shipping and aquaculture), as well as control and monitoring efforts to reduce NIS impacts on indigenous species.

SI ;MED ;13;D3;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Slovenia reported the ‘extraction of species’ to be the sole relevant pressure for D3 in its waters. Fisheries, including recreational fishing, were listed as the only activity contributing to the pressure. The PoM directly addresses both activities. Slovenia stated that more details can be found in the CFP and GFCM documents referred to in the PoM, however including some more information on this subject in the PoM would have improved the overall content for D3. The pressures are nonetheless considered to be addressed by the reported measures.

At the subregional level, most of the neighbouring countries also identified fisheries as an underlying cause of the pressure ‘extraction of species’.

At regional level, UNEP/MAP has defined an ecological objective for commercially exploited fish: ‘Populations of selected commercially exploited fish and shellfish are within biologically safe limits, exhibiting a population age and size distribution that is indicative of a healthy stock’  (with associated operational objectives and indicators). Commercial fishing is one of the main human activities responsible for the extraction of species and is covered in Slovenia’s D3 PoM.

SI ;MED ;13;D3;Coverage of GES and targets ;"Slovenia provided a GES definition for D3, which relates to the exploitation of fish and shellfish for commercial purposes within ‘safe biological boundaries’ (e.g. fishing pressure and spawning stock biomass (SSB)) and indicators such as age/size distribution. The measures controlling fishing effort within the framework of the CFP and the GFCM should lead to the achievement of a sustainable SSB. Age/size distribution is not mentioned in the PoM either, although the control of fishing effort and minimum landing sizes included in the CFP should affect this parameter. Overall, GES could be considered to be addressed.

Slovenia reported four targets. The first (target 3.1) focuses on the reduction of fishing mortality to a level which will ensure sustainable use of fish (some species are mentioned: sole (Solea solea), sardine (Sardina pilchardus), and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus)). Another target (3.3) includes the establishment of management recommendations, such as temporal fishing bans and limits to fishing effort. The two remaining targets focus on impact assessments of recreational fishing (target 3.2), and the development of indicators describing the stocks of commercial species by 2021 (target 3.4). The descriptor-specific measures will cover commercial and recreational fisheries: measure D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU2 is expected to reduce fishing effort to more sustainable levels and addresses all targets, while D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU5 sets out management measures to better control recreational fishing, which should address target 3.2. A horizontal measure (D1-11: TU9) specifically addresses the development of indicators for stock assessments.

Overall, GES and targets for D3 are considered to be addressed by the PoM.

It thus applies an exception.

Timeline for implementation of the PoM
Two of the measures are existing. The existing but not yet implemented measure is expected to be implemented by 2017-2021.";Slovenia does not report new measures for D3. It reports that GES will not be achieved by 2020 and an exception with grounded justifications is provided. The timelines are therefore appropriate.;3;Appropriate ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/54b24d3b-c572-4f42-a273-1da098633c7b/details
SI ;MED ;14;D3;Exceptions ;"Slovenia applies an exception under Article 14(1)(a) (‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’). It explains that its initial assessment found the state of fish stocks to be poor: the stock of sole (Solea solea) is overfished, and the stock of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) already fully exploited. This is mainly due to the intensive fishing activity in the Mediterranean Sea region and in the Adriatic Sea subregion, in which Slovenia holds an insignificant weight, catching less than 1% of the total catch of small pelagic species.

Slovenia explains that it does not have a strong influence on the state of fish stocks, in view of the size of its commercial fishing fleet. Since it claims to have already drastically reduced its annual landings (by 97% between 1983 and 2014) and implemented structural measures to reduce pressures on overfished stocks (i.e. permanent cessation of fishing activities and restructuring of fishing vessels), it calls for a response at a (sub)regional level to effectively implement a reduction in fishing effort and for sustainable management of fish stocks within the framework of the CFP. Slovenia's PoM includes a measure that addresses action at a (sub)regional level (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU9), which addresses the implementation of the CFP simultaneously with the actions of the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation.

This assessment finds the justification of the exception grounded. Considering the size of the Slovenian fishing fleet compared to its neighbouring Member States and the measures already put in place by Slovenia, further regional cooperation and measures are needed to achieve a real improvement in the state of fish stocks in the Adriatic Sea.

In addition, Slovenia reports that its regional cooperation measures for D3 (D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU9) fall under Article 15 MSFD. This has not been analysed in this report a’ the Commission's Article 16 assessment focuses on the assessment of measures and exceptions reported under Article 13 and Article 14.";Slovenia applies an exception for D3 based on Article 14(1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State is not responsible’. The size of Slovenia’s fishing fleet compared to its neighbouring Member States is mentioned (only 1% of the total catch of small pelagic species in the subregion is caught by Slovenia’s fishing fleet and its annual landings decreased by 97% between 1983 and 2014). The justification provided relates to the small weight of Slovenia’s fisheries in the region, and it specifies actions that have already been taken on the issue (significantly reducing the capacity of their fleets). This assessment finds the justification of the exception grounded.;3;Grounded ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/54b24d3b-c572-4f42-a273-1da098633c7b/details
SI ;MED ;13;D5;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Slovenia highlighted the pressure ‘nutrient enrichment’ as relevant for its waters, pointing to agriculture, urban activities (including municipal waste water discharge) and tourism and recreation (including yachting) as activities causing the pressure. It also reported aquaculture and industry as minor or localised pressures. Not all of these activities are covered by measures reported in Slovenia’s PoM. Measure D5: TU1 addresses urban and industrial activities, while measure D5: TU2 addresses agriculture. However, tourism/recreational activities and aquaculture (even if it has only a local impact) are not covered. The measures therefore partially address the relevant pressures and activities. It should be noted that the description of measure D5: TU1 in the PoM refers also to non-specified measures to prevent and reduce environmental pollution from activities and devices that may cause environmental pollution on a larger scale but, due to a lack of detail, it is not clear whether these measures would address the remaining pressures reported by Slovenia under Article 8 (aquaculture, tourism and recreation). 
At the subregional level, Slovenia’s neighbouring Member States identified the same or even fewer activities as contributors to nutrient enrichment (agriculture, urban activities, industry and aquaculture, although aquaculture and industry were not mentioned by Italy). The pressures are therefore considered to be addressed at a subregional level, with the exception of aquaculture. 
At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s activities focuses on land-based sources. Industry, urban areas and agriculture represent the biggest polluters in the Mediterranean Sea. For example, untreated waste water and agriculture can leach many nutrients into the sea, causing eutrophication. According to UNEP/MAP, 66 million m3 of untreated industrial waste water containing nutrients (as well as other elements such as heavy metals) enter the sea directly every year. The agricultural sector is an important contributor to pollution in the Mediterranean Sea, with more and more fertilisers being used in the catchment basins and coastal areas. These pollutants can get into the sea through run-off water, groundwater, wetlands and rivers . In addition, 48% of urban centres lack sewage treatment facilities . MEDPOL, UNEP/MAP Secretariat and the Programme on Pollution have developed pollution indicators for elements such as chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen . One of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives targets eutrophication: ‘Human‐induced eutrophication is prevented, especially adverse effects thereof, such as losses in biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, harmful algal blooms and oxygen deficiency in bottom waters’ (with associated operational objectives and indicators) . All of the key pressures identified by UNEP/MAP, i.e. industry, agriculture and urban activities, are addressed by Slovenia’s PoM.";The measures partially address most of the key pressures and activities identified in Slovenia’s Article 8 reporting, i.e. agriculture, urban activities and industry. It is unclear how tourism and aquaculture (even if it has been reported under Article 8 as having only local impacts) are covered.;2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/54b24d3b-c572-4f42-a273-1da098633c7b/details
SI ;MED ;13;D5;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Slovenia’s GES definition for D5, the adverse effects of anthropogenically-induced eutrophication, such as losses in biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, harmful algae blooms and oxygen deficiency in bottom waters, should be minimal (the same definition as in Annex I to the MSFD). However, under Article 9, additional indicators were reported, referring to the annual average concentrations of nutrients in coastal waters; no harmful bloom in open waters caused by human activities; episodes of lack of oxygen (hypoxia) in the bottom layer do not cause lasting damage to habitats on the seabed; and an appropriate balance of marine flowering meadows at the bottom of the infralittoral sedimentary. 

Slovenia has defined three environmental targets for D5, which refer to the environmental objectives in the WFD: achieving GES and avoiding the deterioration of the status on sedimentary seabed of infralittoral depending on the status of marine flowering meadows; achieving GES and avoiding deterioration of status regarding the oxygen concentration at the bottom, which should be suitable for the survival of demersal fauna (episodes of lack of oxygen in the bottom layer should be temporally and spatially limited so as not to cause death of demersal organisms and permanent damage to the seabed). The aim of these targets is either to achieve or maintain GES, and they are simply iterations of the above definitions of GES.

Slovenia’s premise is that nutrients are the primary cause of eutrophication (organic loading is not considered in either definition, although it is in the supporting Commission Decision). The remaining parts of the definition are concerned with direct and indirect effects of nutrient enrichment. The measures aim to reduce the input from sources of nutrients/organic matter, and, if concentrations in the marine environment are kept sufficiently low, neither direct nor indirect eutrophication impacts will occur. The measures are therefore directly relevant to the GES definition (and targets).

Slovenia explained that GES is already achieved for D5. It also reports that in order to maintain GES by 2020 for eutrophication (D5), it is necessary to upgrade the existing measures (i.e. 1a) with existing but not yet implemented measures (i.e. 1b). As it reports such measures for eutrophication (D5), GES is expected to also be achieved by 2020. The planned analysis of the effectiveness of the implementation of the measures will form the basis for upgrading or defining new measures for D5 if needed.

SI ;MED ;13;D7;Coverage of pressures ;"According to Slovenia, the main source of hydrographical change is interference with hydrological processes caused by land claim and coastal defence, and port operations. All of these activities are addressed by the horizontal measure D1-D11:TU1, as well as by measures D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU1, D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU4 and in D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU6. Due to their nature, these measures relate mainly to permitting and licensing regimes and would thus also cover any other activities. Some of the legal regimes applicable (e.g. MSP, ICZM) would allow for cumulative impacts to be addressed. Port operations and shipping are also covered by measures D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: TU6 and D1, 3, 4, 6, 7: DU2. The spatial scope of measures is not specified. The PoM therefore addresses the pressures.

At the subregional level, in the Adriatic Sea, only Greece has reported pressures and activities relevant to D7, listing land claim, desalination, industry, agriculture and urban activities. These activities are likely to be covered by Slovenia’s specific measures for hydrographical changes.  

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives concerns hydrographical conditions: ‘Alteration of hydrographic conditions does not adversely affect marine ecosystems’  (with associated operational objectives and indicators). UNEP/MAP’s guideline document on desalination explains that these plants always release brine, whose salinity has an important impact on the marine environment. Desalination plants can thus have a significant impact on the marine environment . Generally speaking, any industry or plant releasing compounds that could change the characteristics of the marine water (its salinity, for example) is likely to disturb the hydrological processes, thus industry can be expected to have an impact on hydrological processes as well. As explained above, the measures set out for Slovenia would cover any activities with impact on the marine environment.
";The measures address the pressures identified in Slovenia’s Article 8 reporting, i.e. land claim and coastal defence, and port operations, through existing permitting processes.

Slovenia is committed to the WFD, which should address its definition of GES in respect of both the concentration of contaminants and the effect that at least one of these (TBT, through measure D8: DU1) might have on organisms, as well as APEs (through for example D8: TU1, D8: TU3, D8: TU4 and D8: TU6). Some measures specifically cover particular types of contaminants (agricultural, such as pesticides through measures D8: TU2, or coming from industrial and urban sources, through measure D8: TU1). The PoM thus addresses the GES definition.

Slovenia defines seven targets for D8: concentrations of pollutants in water, sediment and biota considering the limits set under the WFD and the EQSD (target 8.1), biological impacts (target 8.2), concentrations of radionuclides in the water (target 8.3), occurrence of APEs (target 8.4), concentrations of pollutants and metals in sediment (baseline) (target 8.5), the use of biomarkers (e.g. TBT) (target 8.6), sources of pollution by TBT and relevant measures (target 8.7).

SI ;MED ;14;D8;Exceptions ;"Slovenia applies an exception for D8 based on Article 14(1)(e) ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’. Slovenia explains that an initial assessment of the state of the marine environment with respect to contamination showed excess concentrations of TBTs and mercury in sediment, mainly due to industrial activities and maritime traffic. However, the presence of surplus values of TBTs and mercury may also be the consequence of old burdens, as some activities (Idrija mercury mine, vessels coatings containing TBTs) have been abandoned and should lead to lower concentrations of these pollutants. Despite the decrease of activities releasing TBTs and mercury in the environment, the natural conditions (especially in northern part of the Adriatic Sea subregion) do not permit timely improvement of the state of the marine environment, affecting Slovenia’s ability to achieve GES by 2020. Excessive concentrations of TBTs and mercury are therefore due to historical contamination and natural conditions.
The assessment finds this justification grounded, as some substances in sediments have long decay periods and it is unlikely that they will decompose quickly enough to achieve GES by 2020, in view of the natural conditions. 

Slovenia recognises the long decay periods of pollutant substances as a chronic problem, which it has only limited capabilities to remedy. It will, however, continue to monitor levels and trends, as well as TBT effects. 

In addition, Slovenia reports that its regional cooperation measure for D8 (D8: DU1(2a)) falls under Article 15 MSFD. This has not been analysed in this report as the Commission's Article 16 assessment focuses on the assessment of measures and exceptions reported under Article 13 and Article 14.

This should be highlighted through samples of fish, fish products and bivalve molluscs in relation to catches in the waters under national jurisdiction. The D9 measures, together with those for D8, will address GES, as various contaminant pathways are addressed, and sufficient seafood sampling and monitoring is conducted to identify potential risks for human consumption. 

Slovenia defines two targets for D9: concentrations of contaminants in fish and shellfish for human consumption must not exceed the limits laid down in EU legislation or other standards relevant to human health (target 9.1); and inspection of a proper share of the catch landed by fishing vessels, where it contains fish, shellfish or other animals intended for human consumption (target 9.2). All three measures defined by Slovenia for D9 address these two targets. For example, D9: TU1 mentions Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006, which is especially relevant for target 9.1, while D9: TU3 (the monitoring of pollutants in fish and shellfish caught or harvested in Slovenian waters) covers target 9.2. The measures thus address the targets defined by Slovenia for D9.";The measures address GES and targets, as, taken together with the measures reported for D8, they will reduce the concentration of contaminants in marine water, marine species and seafood.

Slovenia reports that in order to achieve and maintain GES by 2020 for contaminants in seafood (D9), it is necessary to upgrade the existing measures (i.e. 1a) with existing but not yet implemented measures (i.e. 1b). Slovenia did report such measures for contaminants in seafood (D9) and GES is therefore expected to be achieved by 2020. The planned analysis of the effectiveness of the implementation of the measures will form the basis for upgrading or defining new measures for D9 if needed.

SI ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"In its Article 8 reporting, Slovenia identified marine litter as a pressure on its marine water, due to fisheries (including recreational fishing), aquaculture and urban activities (municipal waste water discharge). The measures reported address these activities. Additional activities are also covered, such as tourism, shipping and port operations.

Slovenia did not identify the pressure of microplastics (and related activities) in its marine waters during its initial assessment due to the relatively little information available on microplastics in the Adriatic Sea at that time (2012-213). Nevertheless, all studies conducted showed an abundance of microplastics in the Adriatic waters, which indicates that this pressure is relevant for the area. Slovenia defined one specific measure related to the reduction of waste introduction, which specifically mentions microplastics (D10:DU2).

At the subregional level, Croatia did not report marine litter as a pressure in its marine waters, while Greece and Italy have mainly identified urban activities, tourism and shipping as relevant sources of marine litter. Slovenia’s measures cover these activities. Indeed, some measures focus on waste management, especially in coastal areas, the reduction of consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags, more efficient waste collection from ships, or the establishment of a ‘No Special Fee’ system, which enable to cover all activities reported by neighbouring Member States as sources of litter.

At the regional level, Slovenia’s D10 PoM refers to the regional action plan for marine litter management in the Mediterranean (UNEP/MAP), showing coordination at the Regional Sea Convention (RSC) level. ";The measures reported by Slovenia address the reported pressures and cover the activities reported in Article 8. The measures cover fisheries, aquaculture and urban activities as the main identified contributors to D10-related pressures, as well as additional activities (tourism, shipping and port operations).  ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/54b24d3b-c572-4f42-a273-1da098633c7b/details
SI ;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Slovenia, GES for D10 is achieved when marine litter does not represent a danger for marine life (coastal and marine ecosystem), either due to direct mortality or in the form of indirect effects such as reduced fertility or bioaccumulation in the food web. The measures reported by Slovenia aim to reduce the amount of marine litter entering the marine environment via different channels (land-based, urban, and sea-based, shipping, fisheries and aquaculture), and are expected to decrease negative impacts and uptake of marine litter by marine organisms. It can therefore be concluded that the PoM will contribute to the achievement of GES as defined by Slovenia.

Slovenia, in its PoM, sets two additional targets with regard to the targets reported under Article 10 and the monitoring programme. In its Article 10 reporting, the Slovenia defined the following four targets: to reduce waste in coastal areas, the water column and seabed between 2012-2020; to maintain or reduce the quantity of microplastics on the surface between 2012-2020; to develop criteria and indicators to cover the effects of marine litter and their degraded products (mostly plastic) on the marine ecosystem and human health; and to assess  the amounts/trends of waste in the seabed and the surface, as well as their relevance and effects on the marine ecosystem. The PoM defines two additional targets: to prevent and reduce the amount of waste introduced in the marine environment from land-based and sea-based sources (10.1), and to develop knowledge on the characteristics and impacts of marine litter (including their sources and dispersion) (10.2). 
The indicators defined under the monitoring programme are not explicitly linked to the targets reported under the PoM. Slovenia explained that these targets were updated during the preparation of the PoM and are therefore not completely aligned with the indicators defined for the monitoring programme. However, the aims and purpose of those indicators are still relevant to monitoring progress towards reaching the D10 targets. While the existing measures have not been grouped into categories, the following theme groups can be deduced: management of waste on land; management of waste from shipping; fisheries and aquaculture; and cleaning actions. The existing measures all have a clear relationship with the targets. Similarly, the new measures all have a clear relationship with the (generally formulated) target 10.1. Measure D10: DU1 has also been linked to target 10.2.
The measures thus address GES and targets definitions.";The measures address the GES and target definitions. The measures aim to reduce the amount of marine litter entering the marine environment via the different channels (land-based activities -urban- and sea-based activities -shipping, fisheries and aquaculture) and, eventually, the impact and uptake of marine litter by marine organisms.

SI ;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"Under Article 8, Slovenia reported defence operations, tourism and recreation (including yachting) and shipping as activities causing underwater noise. It also mentioned land claim/coastal defence and port operations but explained that these activities only occur locally (port of Koper). The measures reported cover these activities. Measure D11: DU2 is rather generic and is expected to cover all activities to some extent. It should also be noted that both impulsive and continuous noise are addressed.

At the subregional level, all Member States reported shipping as source of underwater noise. This activity is covered by the measures reported by Slovenia. Italy and Greece reported marine hydrocarbon extraction, while Greece and Croatia reported marine research, as activities causing underwater noise. Slovenia does not report specific measures covering these activities since it does not consider them to currently impact on their waters (there is currently no such activities in Slovenian waters). However, adopting a precautionary approach, Slovenia reports two measures: D11: DU2 and D1-D11: DU2 which aim to cover these activities in case these activities may create pressures in the future. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is associated with energy and noise: ‘Noise from human activities causes no significant impact on marine and coastal ecosystems’. Slovenia’s D11 PoM contributes to addressing this aim.";The measures address the reported pressures and cover the reported activities, which include land claim/coastal defence, port operations (both with only local impact), defence operations, tourism/recreation (including yachting) and shipping as activities causing underwater noise. ;3;Addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/54b24d3b-c572-4f42-a273-1da098633c7b/details
SI ;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"According to Slovenia, GES for D11 is achieved when underwater noise and energy (both continuous and impulsive noise) resulting from human activities are at levels that do not harm the ecosystem.

The measures included in the PoM cover impulsive noise (e,g. D11: DU2) and continuous noise (e.g. D11: DU1), and thus address the GES definition.

Slovenia updated its targets during the preparation of the PoM. Therefore, the targets for D11 differ slightly from those reported under Article 10 and the monitoring programme, although still keeping the same overall goals. Slovenia defines four targets in the PoM: regulate sectors and/or activities which emit impulsive (target 11.1)/continuous (target 11.2) sound to reduce underwater noise; and develop methods and approach for monitoring underwater noise at the national (target 11.3)/regional (target 11.4) level. In Article 10 and the monitoring programme, target 11.1 is the same as that defined in the PoM, while target 11.2 should correspond to target 11.3 of the PoM, and target 11.3 is similar to target 11.4 of the PoM, with different scope (being at regional level in the PoM and subregional level in Article 10 and the monitoring programme).

Two targets aim to regulate noise (impulsive and continuous) and they are addressed by the measures reported in the PoM (e.g. D11: DU2 and D11: DU1). Two additional targets aim to monitor underwater noise at different spatial scales and are addressed, as clarified by Slovenia, through horizontal measures such as D1-D11: TU5, D1-D11: TU9 and D1-D11: TU10. Slovenia explained that it will assess the effectiveness of these measures in the future in order to decide upon the need of updating the PoM on D11.

UK;MED ;13;D2;Coverage of pressures ;"Gibraltar belongs to the Western Mediterranean Sea subregion. The UK reported NIS introductions as a pressure on its marine environment under Article 8 and identified shipping, tourism and recreation and defence operations as activities causing the pressure. The existing measures that the UK reports for Gibraltar to address D2 include IMO control measures relating to shipping and ballast water management efforts. Shipping (including biofouling), a main source of new NIS introductions, is thus addressed through the PoM. Furthermore, the UK reports the systematic application of EIA procedures for new projects to address other anthropogenic activities that represent a risk for introducing NIS into Gibraltar’s waters. However, these activities have not been specified by the UK. Tourism and recreation activities and defence operations are not addressed by any specific measure. Therefore, the UK partly covers relevant pressures in the Western Mediterranean Sea. 

Other Member States in the subregion also highlight fisheries, aquaculture, tourism and shipping as contributing to the spread of non-indigenous species in the Western Mediterranean Sea subregion. Out of these, the UK in Gibraltar addresses shipping.

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s priority is to monitor the spreading of invasive species , : “Non‐indigenous species introduced by human activities are, to the maximum extent possible, at levels that do not adversely alter the ecosystem” (associated to operational objectives and indicators). According to UNEP/MAP, maritime transport (or shipping) increased significantly in the Mediterranean Sea between 1997 and 2006 (50% rise in the transport capacity). This is the main cause of the rapid development of invasive and non-indigenous species (especially in the western basin, although the Suez Canal is the main mode of the introduction of such species in the eastern Mediterranean Sea) .

At the regional level, OSPAR does not identify pressures related to commercial fishing (apart from indirectly, through its impacts on biological diversity and healthy ecosystems), given that fisheries are beyond the remit of OSPAR’s work. This prevents comparing with regional pressures and priorities in the context of this descriptor. ";The measures for the NEA address the main pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting (extraction of species of fish and shellfish and selective extraction of species). They also partially address physical damage, spatial protection, and restoration of marine ecosystems. Measures for Gibraltar partially address relevant pressures.

UK;MED ;13;D3;Coverage of pressures ;"The UK reports that Gibraltar has no existing fishing fleet and, therefore, no measures are needed to control national exploitation levels. Under Article 8, it reported that even though commercial fishing was banned in BGTW, illegal fishing takes place in these waters. 

The UK reports under Article 8 that national recreational fishing activities are important in Gibraltar’s waters. The Member State reports one measure that includes the implementation of ICCAT fisheries regulations and reports that this measure will reduce impacts on sensitive fish species and the fish communities overall. Nevertheless, this assessment finds that this measure will only be applicable for recreational fisheries and thus illegal fishing activities of commercial nature might not be sufficiently addressed. Therefore, the measures partially cover pressures for D3. 

The MPA status of certain areas within Gibraltar’s marine waters may support fish habitat protection. 

At the subregional level, all other Member States have identified fisheries, including recreational fishing, as a relevant activity as the source of extraction of species. The UK only addresses recreational fisheries as it is not conducting commercial fishing in BGTW. 

At the regional level, according to UNEP/MAP, fishing effort increased until the mid-1980s in the Mediterranean Sea, reaching approximately 1 million tons. It has been steadily decreasing since 2000, largely due to weak fisheries management. Since then, some stocks are recovering. However, many stocks are fully exploited and some have collapsed. Consequently, fishing appears to be one of the main human activities responsible for the extraction of species. The UK refers to the Barcelona Convention in its spatial protection measure. The UK states that even though it has not ratified the Barcelona Convention, it will be seeking more active engagement under the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) to ensure common approaches in the implementation of measures.";The measures for the NEA address the main pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting (extraction of species of fish and shellfish and selective extraction of species).

The UK applies Article 14(1)(e) ‘natural conditions which do not allow timely improvement in the status of the marine waters concerned’). The Member State believes that the measures will, overall, support to achieve the D3 targets and GES. However, the UK states that it will take time for stocks to respond to changes in exploitation rates and for biomass to increase to the targeted levels. As such, the targeted biomass levels will not be achieved by 2020. The UK adds that stock recovery is likely to be also affected by dominant biological and climatic conditions, which are beyond the control of measures. The applied exception relates to the timeline by which GES will be achieved (in this case beyond the deadline of 2020) and not to the full achievement of GES in the future. 

The exception applies to not reaching GES by 2020 and to the following targets: Target 16 - Fish, Target 17 - Fish, Target 18 - Fish, Target 19 - Fish, Target_1_D3, Target_2_D3. The UK does not report a date for when it expects GES to be achieved.

UK;ATL ;13;D5;Coverage of pressures ;"According to the UK under Article 8, the main sources of nutrients leading to eutrophication problems in UK seas originate from sewage treatment works and run-off from agriculture which enter the marine environment via rivers and through direct and diffuse discharges. The Member State also reports that atmospheric inputs originating from industrial installations and vehicles are also present, but they are small, and are thus not thought to be significant for the UK’s identified problem areas which the MSFD targets relate to. Furthermore, aquaculture was reported as a relevant activity under Article 8. 

The reported measures are likely to partially address the pressures and activities reported by the UK in Article 8 for D5, which is nutrient enrichment through inputs of fertilisers and other Nitrogen and Phosphorous rich substances and biological disturbance (even though the meaning of this concept it is not completely clear). The measures actually go beyond the pressures reported in Article 8, as they will also tackle NOx from ships and emissions of nutrients to the atmosphere. However, aquaculture activities are not addressed by the PoM. 

At the subregional level, nutrient enrichment is identified as a pressure by the majority of neighbouring Member States. The human activities that are reported as relevant subregionally are agricultural and industrial activities as well as nutrient input from urban areas. The UK measures address all these.

At the regional level, OSPAR refers to point-source pollution from urban areas and diffuse-source pollution from farming areas. Both of these are covered through the reported measures above. ";The measures for the NEA address most key pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting. They also tackle NOx emissions from ships and nutrient input from atmospheric sources, which is positive. However, aquaculture activities are not covered.

UK;MED ;13;D5;Coverage of pressures ;"The reported measures cover nutrient enrichment, caused primarily by urban activities, in addition to industry, shipping and other various, non-specified, activities. The UK reports for D5 that nutrient levels and the risk for eutrophication are generally low in Gibraltar's waters. Gibraltar has no rivers; therefore, the only potential discharge of urban waters is a point source release in an area with high dispersive capacity. Under article 8, the UK referred to this point source, which is a sewage overflow, and identified it as the only nutrient enrichment source in its waters. Nevertheless, the UK also states that during the 1st and 2nd implementation cycles of the WFD, Gibraltar’s waters were categorised as having a ‘good’ ecological status, except for the enclosed and heavily-modified water body (HMWB) within the harbour and the Western Beach Basin. The Member State specifies that the latter has been impacted by the construction of a combined sewer overflow from a neighbouring country’s territory. Nevertheless, as currently no sewage treatment plant exists in Gibraltar waters, the pressures are partially addressed. If such a plant is built in the future, as currently planned, pressures will be better addressed.

At the subregional level, all other Member States identify agriculture, forestry, and urban activities as relevant for causing the pressure of nutrient enrichment. The first two activities are not relevant for Gibraltar; however, urban activities are relevant for Gibraltar and are addressed by its PoM. Tourism and recreation are also identified by France and Italy. These are possibly addressed by measures covering urban discharges, such as the WFD and the UWWTD. 

At the regional level, UNEP/MAP identifies land-based sources, and namely industry, urban areas, and agriculture as the biggest polluters in the Mediterranean Sea. One of UNEP/MAP’s ecological objectives is: “Human‐induced eutrophication is prevented, especially adverse effects thereof, such as losses in biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, harmful algal blooms and oxygen deficiency in bottom waters” (associated to operational objectives and indicators) .

At the subregional level, neighbouring Member States report land claim and coastal defence as relevant in the North Sea. This activity is also identified as relevant by Ireland in the Celtic Seas. These activities are likely to be covered through measures in the UK PoM, such as licensing measures, marine spatial planning and management measures.

By definition, the measures reported cover all pressures since all projects which could adversely impact hydrological conditions are to be submitted to the existing regulatory procedures; therefore, they will address the pressures identified by OSPAR related to the offshore economy and relevant for D7.

The measures reported are likely to address the pressures (interference with hydrological processes) and associated activities (e.g. through EIA-related measures). It should however be noted that Gibraltar’s PoM focuses mainly on reducing future hydrological impacts through EIAs for new projects, but does not address current activities or past hydrographical changes. The measures reported in the PoM cover all new activities submitted to regulatory impacts assessment (EIAs), but these pressures may also be linked to activities not submitted to such regulatory procedures. It is also not clear how cumulative impacts are addressed. 

At the subregional level, Spain and France reported hydrological processes as a pressure, which they have associated with a number of activities (desalination, industry, agriculture, urban, land claim, port operations). Most of these activities are likely to be covered by Gibraltar’s PoM through EIA measures. However, most of Gibraltar’s drinking water originates from desalination plants, therefore this pressure should be further addressed by specific measures.

As stated previously in the section concerning pressures, the measures will protect Gibraltar’s waters from future hydrographical changes through EIA and restrictions set by the Habitats Directive and the WFD. Our assessment finds that the PoM partially addresses the GES and targets, as the UK does not report how cumulative impacts are addressed through the licensing and permitting procedures.;"The measures partially address D7 targets and the GES determination (baseline scenario) in the NEA. The measures apply the relevant regulatory framework to all relevant human activities (e.g. covered through the EIA and SEA Directives). Cumulative impacts do not seem to be addressed by the reported measures, even though they are mentioned in the targets. 
For Gibraltar, GES and targets are also partially covered by the PoM, given that they will prevent future impacts on hydrographical changes through EIA and restrictions under the Habitats and Water Framework Directives, applicable to new projects. It is not clear how cumulative impacts are addressed, and if any pressures stemming from activities not covered through these regulatory instruments will be addressed.

UK;ATL ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"According to the UK, most problems are local in nature and close to the sources, particularly in industrialised estuaries and coasts, and largely caused by historic pollution in the context of D8 (i.e. where concentrations or biological effects parameters exceed assessment thresholds). The volume of oil accidentally spilled varies widely from year to year and is generally small and of a relatively minor significance, unless there is a major spill. 

The reported measures address the pressures reported by the UK in Article 8 for D8 which were: ‘introduction of synthetic compounds’; ‘introduction of non-synthetic compounds’; ‘introduction of radio-nuclides’; ‘acute pollution events’. The UK had also reported ‘biological disturbance (other)’ and explains that it corresponds to cases where contaminants have effects on organisms or biological processes in organisms (e.g., imposex  due to TBT). In terms of activities, the UK had reported in its Article 8 assessment that the main activities responsible for contamination of the marine environment were industry, shipping and oil and gas extraction. All three types of activity are covered by the measures proposed by the UK, which cover additional activities (e.g. agriculture, dredging, etc.). The UK further explains that all measures cited in the UK Article 13 report which apply to D8 will help ensure that there is no further deterioration resulting from the ubiquitous PBTs (see exception), and that the current monitoring programmes show that there has been no significant deterioration.

At the subregional level, neighbouring Member States have identified the same pressures and activities as relevant in the marine environment, and go further by identifying agriculture and urban activities as relevant. All these are covered by the UK in its PoM. 

Finally, the measures address the relevant pressures reported as ‘main threats’ in the OSPAR North-East Atlantic Environment Strategy, i.e. pollution from hazardous substances as well as pollution from radioactive substances.";"The measures reported by the UK for the NEA address all key pressures and activities identified in their Article 8 reporting, including the introduction of synthetic and non-synthetic compounds; the introduction of radio-nuclides and acute pollution events. The measures draw upon international, EU and regional pieces of legislation including (but not limited to) the WFD, OSPAR and MARPOL.

UK;MED ;13;D8;Coverage of pressures ;"Under article 8, the UK reported that contamination by hazardous substances originated from point source and diffuse discharges, including industrial and agricultural discharges. Furthermore, it identified maritime transport to cause chemical pollution. Based on the reported measures it is likely that industrial discharges and contamination from shipping will be addressed by the measures. Even though agricultural discharges can be an issue, they do not originate from activities within Gibraltar’s territory. Still, pollution from agricultural activities is likely to be addressed by the existing measures reported by the UK. Regional cooperation could also help covering this source of contaminants. Overall, the measures address the D8 pressures and activities, as relevant activities identified under article 8 are covered.

At the subregional level, other Member States identify the pressure Introduction of Synthetic and Non-Synthetic Compounds to be relevant and to be caused by various activities, including industry, agriculture, urban activities, shipping and port operations. The UK covers most of these activities. It is not clear whether port operations are covered, even though they are important in Gibraltar’s waters. France and Spain also report accidental pollution caused by shipping under Article 8, which is covered by the Gibraltar PoM. 

At the regional level, according to UNEP/MAP, introduction of synthetic compounds is recognised as an important issue in the Mediterranean Sea region.

UK;ATL ;14;D8;Exceptions ;"The UK applies an exception for D8 through the use of Article 14(4) (‘disproportionate costs’). The UK believes that its D8 measures are overall sufficient to achieve its D8 targets and GES – as in most cases GES is already achieved – except for certain ‘legacy’ chemicals in sediment samples close to sources of historic pollution. According to the UK, these are so persistent that achieving GES levels by 2020 for these contaminants would require, for example, the application of removal and remediation measures on a large scale (according to the UK, based on models and in some cases, it would take until the year 3000 for the ubiquitous PBTs to reach background concentrations through natural recovery). The UK considers such measures to be technically unfeasible and to carry a ‘disproportionate cost’ in relation to the risks to the environment. Considering that these chemicals have already been phased-out, our assessment finds that the justification provided in this case is partially grounded. It would be necessary that the UK provides a more in-depth justification for the application of the exception. This could include a cost-benefit analysis and an analysis of the pros and cons of alternative remediation actions, including natural recovery, such as a multi-criteria analysis. In any case, it is important that the effects of action or inaction be monitored.

Furthermore, this assessment finds that the application of an exception under Article 14(4) is not suitable, as the justification provided hints to natural conditions of the marine environment in the region.

UK;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"According to the UK, the initial assessment (Article 8) indicated some problems from marine litter in all regions within the North Sea and the Celtic Seas where there are systematic surveys of beach litter density. However, the Member State reports that since there is limited understanding as well as data of marine litter properties and impacts, the UK has thus not set quantitative targets, but rather surveillance targets in order to counter uncertainties regarding impacts and the lack of data. It should be noted that OSPAR has one of the most developed marine litter work areas in European regions and such data might in fact be available. 

In terms of pressures, the UK has identified marine litter in general as a pressure on its marine environment, and specifically pinpointed marine litter sources which include land-based activities and industries, as well as coastal, riverine, and atmospheric inputs from land-based sources through industrial discharges. The reported activities under Article 8 were fisheries, industry and tourism and recreational activities. Based on the existing and planned measures reported, and the KTMs covered, our assessment finds that the UK measures will address the main pressures as identified by the UK in its Article 8 and aim to tackle the main sources of marine litter. 

The neighbouring Member States in both subregions identified fisheries, tourism and recreational activities and shipping as relevant for causing marine litter, and are covered in the UK PoM. 

The planned UK measures will link with OSPAR Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter (RAP), thus addressing regional priorities and adopting regional approaches as well. The UK anticipates that independent national litter reductions will contribute towards a regional reduction of litter in the North East Atlantic.";"In the NEA region the measures reported by the UK address all key pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting, and also cover the main anthropogenic activities and sources of marine litter identified (land-based activities and industries, as well as coastal, riverine and atmospheric inputs from land-based sources through industrial discharges).

UK;MED ;13;D10;Coverage of pressures ;"Under article 8, the UK identified shipping, defence operations and tourism and recreation as relevant activities for causing the pressure marine litter. In its PoM the Member State addresses the pressure litter, caused by shipping activities, through its measures under the Port Reception Facilities Directive. Furthermore, it addresses land-based sources (industry and urban) and recreational activities through a number of measures under the Waste Framework Directive, Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, Bathing Water Directive and WFD. Marine defence operations are not addressed by specific measures. Therefore, the pressure is partially addressed. 

In its PoM, the Member State also refers to micro-litter being an issue in its waters. It does not specify which measures cover this pressure, but it is likely that it is covered through the reported measures linked to EU legislation, such as WFD, UWWTD etc. 

Nevertheless, the additional ‘measure’ reported by the Member State which is essentially the MSFD monitoring programme for D10, cannot be considered a measure and has not been considered in this assessment. 

At the subregional level, the neighbouring Member States identified fisheries, urban activities, tourism and shipping activities as responsible for causing marine litter. Apart from fisheries, these activities are also covered by the UK in Gibraltar. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is about litter: “Marine and coastal litter do not adversely affect coastal and marine environment”  (associated to operational objectives and indicators). UNEP/MAP also published a report on the assessment of marine litter in the Mediterranean Sea. It acknowledges the fact that this pressure constitutes a serious threat for the marine environment and is due to the densely-populated coasts (urban activities), the well-developed tourism and the passage of 30% of the global maritime traffic (shipping) . The UK is not a contracting party to the Barcelona Convention, however it will be seeking more active engagement under the Mediterranean Acton Plan (MAP) to ensure common approaches in the implementation of measures.

UK;ATL ;13;D10;Coverage of GES and targets ;Existing and existing but not yet implemented measures address the target of overall reduction in the number of visible litter items within specific categories/types on coastlines (Target_1_10.1.1). Since the UK D10 GES and targets are very broad, it is likely that the measures will indirectly contribute to the two other operational targets: 1) the development of an operational surveillance indicator to monitor the quantities of litter on the seafloor (Target_ 2_10.1.2) and 2) the operational surveillance indicator to monitor the amounts of plastic found in the contents of fulmars stomachs as a method of determining litter floating at the surface (in line with OSPAR Ecological Quality Objective) (Target_3_10.1.2, applicable to the Greater North Sea only). Although there is no target on litter in the water column and seabed, the UK measures nevertheless also address these to a certain extent given that their measures are linked with implemented actions under the OSPAR Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter of 2014, which has actions that cover sea-based litter as well as land-based sources of marine litter. It should be noted that the UK targets are surveillance targets (rather than environmental targets), but the Member State has justified its approach in setting these type of targets as explained in the section above on assessment against pressures. The UK further explains that these surveillance indicators have been tested and environmental targets will be provided for the next update of the targets in 2018.;"The measures reported by the UK for the NEA address the D10 GES and targets.

UK;ATL ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"According to the UK, adverse effects of underwater noise on vulnerable/threatened species and key functional groups at a population level may occur through physical harm or behavioural change, such as changes in distribution and communication, leading to reduced productivity. The UK also states that on the basis of present and estimated future levels of activity, the conclusion by experts is that activity levels are not currently anticipated to pose a significant threat to marine noise sensitive species at the population level.

In terms of pressures, the UK has identified underwater noise from renewable energy sources, percussive pile driving operations, marine hydrocarbon extraction, dredging activity, land claim and coastal defence, shipping, and underwater acoustic equipment used for research activities as relevant in its Article 8. The reported measures mostly address these pressures. However, ambient noise and noise from research activities may not be fully covered.

At the subregional level in the North Sea, marine-based renewable energy, defence operations, marine research and shipping were identified by neighbouring Member States. In the Celtic Seas marine research and shipping were identified. Ireland reports like the UK marine hydrocarbon extraction and dredging as relevant for causing underwater noise. Most of these activities are covered in the UK PoM, however, defence operations and marine research are not specifically covered by the measures. 

At the regional level, the UK is part of the OSPAR correspondence group on underwater noise and in line with regional priorities as defined by the RSC. ";"The measures reported by the UK partially address the key pressures identified in their Article 8 reporting in the NEA, covering the main anthropogenic activities (i.e. underwater acoustic equipment such as seismic activities, piling, and explosive use) which are sources of noise pollution in the marine environment. Continuous underwater noise may not be yet fully covered, in addition to impulsive noise from defence and research activities.
In Gibraltar, pressures are partially addressed; EIA and AA measures will contribute to reducing noise pressures, but they will not be sufficient to cover noise impacts from shipping, defence/military and recreational activities within the region. ";2;Partially addressed ;https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/34113a51-f266-41b5-a361-b717de0e2d6a/details
UK;MED ;13;D11;Coverage of pressures ;"The UK reported under Article 8 that the activities shipping, tourism, defence operations, maintenance dredging and anchoring were causing underwater noise pressures. In its PoM the UK reports that activities causing important underwater noise levels are shipping, which causes continuous noise; and seismic survey activities which are the source of impulsive noise. Nevertheless, the Member State reports EIA and AA measures for D11, and it is not clear how these will reduce the key pressures, especially in relation to shipping activities. The EIA and AA measures could possibly address dredging activities, which the UK reports are mainly conducted for port maintenance. Nevertheless, EIA measures will reduce noise impacts resulting from some projects that are planned to be conducted. Therefore, the pressures are partially addressed.

At the subregional level, marine hydrocarbon extraction, port operations, marine research and shipping activities have been identified by the neighbouring Member States as the main activities causing underwater noise. Hydrocarbon extraction activities are not relevant for the UK in Gibraltar; however, the other activities are relevant. As stated above, it is not clear how the UK addresses these activities and the pressure. 

At the regional level, one of UNEP/MAP’s objectives is that: “Noise from human activities cause no significant impact on marine and coastal ecosystems”  (associated to operational objectives and indicators). The UK states that even though it is not a contracting party to the Barcelona Convention, it will be seeking more active engagement under the Mediterranean Acton Plan (MAP) to ensure common approaches in the implementation of measures.

UK;ATL ;13;D11;Coverage of GES and targets ;"All the existing and existing but not yet implemented measures relate to target D11_1. Target D11_2 is not addressed by the reported measures. The existing measures (including the noise registry, which is now in place) are likely to support the achievement of the UK targets to have a better view on the pressures concerning the Target 1 and the associated indicator. Yet, the UK does not report measures explicitly for Target 2. The UK mentions that it plans to set up a monitoring programme for continuous noise but this is done very briefly in the text-based report, and is not reported under “existing but not yet implemented measures”. 

Certain inconsistencies exist in the way that the measures are categorised. The measures defined as existing are also reported as existing but not yet implemented (i.e. the noise registry). Furthermore, the one potential measure that is briefly discussed that could have been defined as new (based on the UK target 2 and identified knowledge gaps and plans) is not defined as such. Thus, the UK D11 measures partially address the UK targets. ";"The measures reported by the UK partially address the D11 GES and targets in the NEA.

SE ;BAL ;14;D9;Exceptions ;"Sweden applies one exception for D8, Article 14 (1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’. It reports that there is a basic concern that some targets will not be achieved by 2020 for several reasons:

•	Firstly, a proportion of the contamination of Swedish waters results from airborne contamination, which cannot be identified by Sweden alone . Here, it makes a distinction between the presence of ubiquitous chemicals from transboundary sources and other substances that are elevated due to local activities. 
•	Secondly, it states that even if contaminant levels are low, due to the low water turnover in most of Sweden’s waters, it will take a significant time before positive results can be measured and effects will be noticeable (as described for the D5 exception). 
•	This is further complicated by the fact that some targeted substances are persistent (e.g. dioxins and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS), or do not break down (e.g. Mercury and Cadmium). 
•	For contaminated sediment remediation measures in particular, Sweden states that these processes are technically complicated, take time and require considerable resources. 

This assessment finds that the justification provided for non-achievement of GES is grounded. Indeed, certain substances are persistent and transboundary aspects play a role in the introduction of certain contaminants. Nevertheless, no ad-hoc measures are reported in connection to this exception.";"Sweden applies an exception for D8; Article 14 (1)(a) ‘action or inaction for which the Member State concerned is not responsible’. Sweden states that inputs of contaminants from atmospheric deposition are transboundary in nature. Therefore, Sweden reports that a reduction of contaminant inputs through its measures will not be sufficient to achieve GES and that actions and inactions of neighboring Member States will impact the achievement of GES. Additional justifications that relate to persistent contaminants from historical contamination are also mentioned, although these do not directly relate to Article 14 (1)(a).
