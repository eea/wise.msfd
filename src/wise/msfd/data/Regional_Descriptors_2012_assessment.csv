BAL	D1	Art 9	Commission	Milieu	2019-09-20	http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/implementation/pdf/national_reports.zip	"All eight Member States of the marine region have defined GES for Descriptor 1 but none have defined it in the same way (or even similarly). The levels of details vary enormously. This being said, all Member States have defined GES more specifically than in the text of Annex I of the MSFD and most Member States have incorporated some or all of the Commission Decision criteria for D1. Three Member States out of eight have provided specific definitions for each criterion (DK, FI, SE) whereas another four Member States have defined GES at indicator level, some covering all of the criteria and most of the indicators (EE), others covering only certain indicators and criteria (LT, LV, PL). Only one Member State does not cover the Commission Decision criteria at all (DE).

For five Member States (DK, EE, FI, PL and SE), the GES definition covers at least the species, habitats and ecosystem levels but to varying levels of details. For the other three Member States, the definition covers only some of these elements: only species and habitats (DE), only species (LT), only habitats (LV).The level of coherence of the Member States’ reporting at the species level is moderate.The level of coherence of the Member States’ reporting at the habitats level is much lower than at species level. The level of coherence across the Baltic marine region for the definition of Good Environmental Status for Descriptor 1 is low."	"With regard to the definition at species level, four Member States (DK, EE, SE, PL) cover the three main highly-mobile species groups –mammals, birds and fish. One country (LT) only covers two out of the three species groups (birds and fish). All of these five countries have referred to individual species within the three species groups (e.g. harbour porpoise, long-tailed duck, etc.) in their GES definition. For one of these countries (SE), the definition also includes general statements that apply to the whole species groups (e.g. the population sizes of mammals, birds and fish do not deviate from the natural fluctuations of the population). The other four Member States (DK, EE, LT, PL) therefore seem to have selected a number of indicator species. The species most commonly referred to include the harbour seal for mammals and the long-tailed duck for birds. No individual species of fish is singled out. 

For two Member States, specific species groups are not explicitly mentioned (DE, FI). For one of the two countries (FI) it is understood that the definition applies equally to all species while for the other (DE) the definition applies only to protected/listed species. Finally, as mentioned previously one Member State (LV) has not defined GES at species level. Only one Member State (PL) uses the concept of functional groups (although another Member State (SE) refers to “key functional group individuals” but without any more details). No Member State covers explicitly cephalopods, but they could be implicitly covered by the two Member States that cover species at a general level (DE, FI). One Member State (PL) explicitly states that cephalopods are not relevant for the Baltic Sea. Some Member States have referred to types of species (e.g. habitat-forming species, top predators, benthic species) (e.g. DK, FI, LV, SE).

Only one Member State (DE) has included a direct mention to listed/protected species (Habitats and Birds Directives, ASCOBANS, HELCOM BSAP) in its GES definition. Other Member States have referred to individual species that are protected/listed but have not referred to the agreements/ legislation that protect them.  With regard to the definitions at habitats level, the habitat types/zones covered by the GES definitions of the countries of the Baltic marine region are defined in very different ways and there is no uniformity. Only one Member State (DK) refers to the concept of predominant habitats but without actually specifying the predominant habitat types covered by its definition (except for a distinction between hard and soft bottoms). Two Member States (SE, PL) cover a number of seabed habitats types, covering both benthic and pelagic habitats, based on the EUNIS 2 and the HELCOM classification but Poland’s coverage of benthic habitats is very limited. One Member State (FI) covers all habitats types (seabed and water column) because it is very general in its formulation. Only two Member States (EE, LV) refer to specific individual seabed and water column habitats, some of which are protected under the Habitats Directive. One Member State (DE) covers only protected/listed habitats (as per the Habitats Directive and HELCOM). Finally, one Member State (LT) has not defined GES at habitat level. With regard to the definitions at ecosystem level, three Member States (DK, FI, SE) have included a general definition for criterion 1.7, which covers more or less the whole ecosystem structure. Three Member States (EE, LT, PL) have defined criterion 1.7 (and subsequent indicators) focusing only the fish community and using indicators such as the Community trophic index. The last two Member States have not defined GES for criterion 1.7. 

A majority of the GES definitions for D1 in the Baltic marine region are quantified and specific. Four Member States (EE, LT, LV, SE) have defined GES at the indicator level providing specific threshold values and baselines for most of their indicators. The other four Member States (DE, DK, FI, PL) have provided only qualitative normative definitions or very few threshold values. 

In terms of baselines, the approaches adopted by the Member States vary greatly. Only two Member States (FI, SE) have used baselines in the sense of ‘reference conditions’, i.e. in relation to ‘prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic (natural) conditions’ that are largely free from anthropogenic influences. One Member State (LV) refers to “levels associated with polluted conditions” as the boundary between good status (below these levels) and not good status (above these levels). It could be assumed that in this case too good status is defined in relation to prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic (natural) conditions. Two Member States (EE, LT) use “historical conditions” or “historical time series” for their baselines, which seem to refer to past, degraded states. It is not clear in both cases whether there is an ambition to improve from such a state. 

Several Member States (DE, EE, LV, SE) have reflected, directly or indirectly, the definitions for Favourable Conservation Status under the Habitats Directive and/or for Good Ecological Status under the Water Framework Directive. In some cases, the reference is made at a general level (DE), while in other cases the reference is made for specific ecosystem components (EE, LV, SE). Four Member States (DE, EE, LT, SE) have also included in their GES definitions or their accompanying text a reference to HELCOM."	1	Low
BAL	D1	Art 8 Pressures	Commission	Milieu	2019-09-20	http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/implementation/pdf/national_reports.zip	The level of coherence in the approaches used for the initial assessments on physical damage and loss across the Baltic marine region is moderate (even though the level of details varies greatly from one Member State to another). 	"Most of the Member States have undertaken an initial assessment on both physical loss and physical damage; only one Member State (LV) has just provided information on physical loss. One Member State (PL) has not reported any information on the pressures in the reporting sheets or the paper report. However, in the reporting sheets, the same Member State (PL) has reported that the main pressure on habitats in all geographic areas is physical loss and smothering. 

Most Member States have covered different types of physical loss and physical damage, albeit at different levels of detail. The information reported by some Member States is comprehensive (e.g. DK), in other cases the information is rather limited (e.g. EE, LV). All Member States have listed the main causes of pressure – the construction and maintenance of ports (physical loss) and trawling fisheries (physical damage) are the most referred to. The impacts of physical loss and physical damage are covered by all Member States but in most cases (DE, EE, FI, LT, LV, SE) with very little detail. 

As a rule, Member States do not refer expressly to WFD reports and only in few cases HELCOM is directly mentioned (e.g. FI, SE). Two Member States (DK, LT) presented clear conclusive judgements on the current status of both physical loss and physical damage, one (FI) reported this type of judgements only for physical damage and other (LV) only for physical loss.

In the reporting sheets, one Member State (DK) reported that less than 1% of their seabed habitats is affected by physical loss; two Member States (EE, LT) reported 1-5%. The remaining Member States did not report anything. For physical damage, two Member State (EE, LT) reported that 1-5% of their seabed habitats is affected and one Member State (DK) reported 75 to 100%. The other Member States did not report anything.

BAL	D1 	Art 8 Biological features	Commission	Milieu	2019-09-20	http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/implementation/pdf/national_reports.zip	All Member States have undertaken an initial assessment of biological features. All Member States have reported on habitats and species/functional groups, but only some addressed ecosystems (DK, EE, LT, LV).                 The level of coherence of the initial assessments on biological features across the Baltic marine region is considered as relatively low. 	"Habitats
Most Member States covered at least a good share of the relevant seabed habitat types, but many Member States (DE, DK, EE, LT, PL) did not cover, or covered in a very limited way, water column habitat types. The majority of Member States used the MSFD classification of predominant habitats or an equivalent system (in particular EUNIS Level 2 classification). 

In the reporting sheets, only one Member State (DK) reported on listed habitats from the Habitats Directive and three Member States (DE, FI and PL) reported on habitats from the HELCOM list. Four Member States (DE, DK, FI, LV) have reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. The predominant habitat types which have been most reported are shallow sand (three Member States), shelf mixed sediment (three Member States) and shallow mud (three Member States).

When assessing habitats or habitat types, Member States focused on habitat distribution and extent, but not so much on habitats condition or on the main causes of pressure. The main pressures on habitats reported by the Member States are nutrient enrichment, physical loss and damage.  

Most Member States (EE, FI, LT, LV, PL and SE) provided a clear and conclusive judgement on the current status of the habitats, but almost always only for a selection of habitats. A number of Member States (e.g. EE, FI, LV) have judged some of their habitats to be in good status. However, some of these Member States (e.g. EE, LV) have made this judgement even though the habitat distribution, extent or condition was assessed as being altered in relation to natural conditions. In some cases (e.g. EE, LV), this is in line with the fact that the GES definition does not require habitats to be in line with natural conditions to be at GES.  

For the assessment of status, the Habitats Directive is mentioned by all Member States but one (DE). HELCOM is explicitly referred to by at least some Member States (e.g. DK, FI, PL and SE).

Species/functional groups 
Three Member States (DE, DK, LV) used a mixed approach to report on species and functional groups. Two Member States reported only on species groups (FI, SE) and the remaining two Member State reported only on functional groups (EE, LT).  One Member State (PL) has reported on species groups, functional groups and individual species.

Almost all Member States covered at least birds, fish and mammals. In a number of cases, where the information reported did not cover all relevant species groups the justification provided for the gaps was not considered sufficient (e.g. DE, DK, EE). One Member State (LT) did not report on mammals due to the lack of sufficient information. Three Member States have reported on bird functional groups (DE, DK, LT), four Member States have reported on fish functional groups (DK, EE, LT, LV) and two Member States have reported on mammal functional groups (DK, EE). One Member State (PL) carried out the majority of its assessment on birds (wintering birds and white-tailed eagle). The functional groups most reported on were, for birds, birds inshore benthic, birds inshore pelagic and birds offshore pelagic (three Member States), for fish, demersal fish and pelagic fish (four Member States) and for mammals, seals (two Member States).

In the reporting sheets, none of the Member State reported on listed species from the Birds and Habitats Directive. Only two Member State (FI and PL) reported on listed species from the HELCOM.

For the majority of Member States, the reports include information on species abundance and condition and on the main pressures. Those reported most often as the main pressures on species are extraction of species (all species) and physical loss (smothering). 

All Member States provided at least a qualitative/descriptive judgement of the current status of some (e.g. LT) or all (e.g. EE) of the species/functional groups reported on. Six Member States (DE, DK, EE, FI, LT) have judged some of their species/functional groups to be in good status although for one Member State (PL) the sampling size has decreased significantly (from 24 in 2005 to 4 in 2009) risking the results to be less accurate. As for habitats, some of these judgements (e.g. from DE, LT) have been made even though the species composition/population is reported to be altered in relation to natural conditions. Four Member States (DE, EE, FI, LT) have reported some of their species/functional groups to be not in good status. 

Only a few Member States have not systematically referred to the Habitats and Birds Directives (e.g. LT) or to HELCOM (e.g. DK, LV and PL) in their assessment of species/functional groups.

Ecosystems
Only four Member States (DK, EE, LT, LV) have reported on ecosystems. They usually provide very little and reported on the main pressures. Three Member State (DK, EE, LT) provided a conclusive judgement on the current status of their ecosystems in their paper report. In one of the cases (DK) the assessment was negative, in another other case (EE) the majority of the indicators assessed were considered to be at GES, and in the remaining case (LT) the majority of the indicators assessed were considered not to be at GES.

BAL	D1	Art 10 	Commission	Milieu	2019-09-20	http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/implementation/pdf/national_reports.zip	All Member States have defined environmental targets for the biodiversity descriptors, except LV which has not defined targets for Descriptor 4.                          The level of coherence in the setting of targets and indicators across the Baltic marine region is considered to be moderate. 	"Four Member States (DK, EE, FI and PL) have defined separate targets for D1, D4 and D6. Each of these countries has defined at least two targets per descriptor, with Descriptor 1 generally counting the most targets and Descriptor 6 the least. One Member State (SE) has combined the targets for Descriptors 1 and 4 and reported the targets for Descriptor 6 separately but has reported only four targets in total. One Member State (LV) has reported one target and associated indicators (the same as for the GES definition) for Descriptor 1 and one target for Descriptor 6 but has not reported targets for Descriptor 4. 

Two Member States (DE, LT) have addressed with one set of targets the three descriptors. One of these two Member States (LT) has reported only a single target in their reporting sheets along with a number of specific indicators (mainly the same as their GES indicators). These two countries have reported targets at a low level of detail. 

The biodiversity targets represent a mix of state, impact and pressure targets, with a domination of state and impact targets. The pressures addressed are mainly those related to fishing activities and/or causing physical damage to the seafloor (including selective extraction of species, bottom trawling, by-catch, discards, etc.) in particular in relation to D6. Two Member States (LT, LV) have not included any pressure targets. 

Most Member States (DE, DK, EE, FI, PL and SE) have defined targets/indicators for specific species. The inclusion of these species in the Member States’ targets can be because they are considered sensitive/threatened and in need of protection (e.g. listed species from the Habitats and Birds Directive or from the HELCOM Convention), they have a particular function/ role in the ecosystem (e.g. habitat-forming species, slowly-reproducing species, top predators, etc.), they are particular sensitive to certain pressures (e.g. fishing, by-catch) or they are well-studied and monitored. Examples of such species commonly addressed by the targets are harbour, ringed and grey seals. 

Four of the Member States have addressed the main three species groups in their targets: fish, birds, mammals (DK, EE, FI and PL), one Member State (DE) has focused on birds, mammals and benthic species and one Member State (SE) has focused only on fish. A few Member States have covered shellfish, sometimes as part of the seabed habitat associated communities (DE, DK). None of the Member States have addressed cephalopods. 

In terms of habitat types, all Member States have addressed benthic habitats in a general manner or through the condition of the benthic community, in particular using a number of indices/indicators related to the condition of the benthic community (e.g. BQI). Water column habitats are less frequently covered by the biodiversity targets. Only two Member States (DK, FI) have defined targets related to the planktonic community.

Only three Member States (DE, FI and PL) have included targets that relate to regional, EU or international objectives, such as HELCOM, the Habitats and Birds Directive, the Common Fisheries Policy, the Water Framework Directive or the Convention on Biological Diversity. Two Member States (DK, FI) have defined a target related to the establishment of Marine Protected Areas; one other (DE) has set targets related to resettlements of endangered populations and the creation of migration corridors.

In terms of quantification, four Member States (DK, EE, LT, LV) out of eight have defined thresholds and baselines for their targets and associated indicators but for three of them (EE, LT, LV) they have used the same indicators for their targets as for their GES. Therefore only one Member State (DK) has defined quantitative parameters for targets that should help achieve GES rather than being an expression of GES. 

The other four Member States (DE, FI, Pl and SE) have defined potentially measurable targets and indicators but have come short of setting threshold values and baselines that would make them fully SMART. However, these sets of targets are considered to be more in line with the objectives of the Directive as they are designed to help achieve GES rather than being expressions of GES. "	2	Moderate

All Member States but one (LV) have defined GES for Descriptor 4. One Member State (DE) has provided a global definition for D1, D4 and D6, which is only tenuously related to D4. 


None of the other Member States have defined GES for Descriptor 4 the same way.                                                                   The level of coherence across the Baltic marine region for the definition of Good Environmental Status for Descriptor 4 is low."	"One Member State (PL) has addressed each of the D4 criteria and indicators (however, the indicator for marine mammals does not have a GES threshold and is therefore not yet operational). Two Member States (DK, FI) have defined D4 at the level of the criteria but not necessarily covering all criteria. The other three Member States (EE, LT, SE) have defined D4 at the level of the indicator, not necessarily covering all indicators and criteria. Only two Member States (FI, SE) have provided general definitions that cover all food-web components indiscriminately (i.e. from plankton to higher trophic levels), sometimes in addition to more specific indicators. The other Member States have only referred to specific food web components in their GES definition. 

Four of the six Member States that are considered to have defined D4 (DK, EE, FI, LT, PL) have covered at least fish and planktonic communities (including phyto- and zooplankton). Four Member States (EE, LT, SE, PL) refer to certain fish community indices and indicators (e.g. fish community size index, trophic levels, mean maximum length); one of them (SE) mentions the HELCOM FISH-PRO project. In addition, four Member States (DK, FI, SE, PL) have also covered mammals. Only two Member States (SE, PL) has covered seabirds (white-tailed eagle and wintering waterfowl species). 

Four Member States (DK, FI, SE, PL) refer to key species, to top predators or species at the top of the food web. Two Member States (DK, SE) also include specific species as indicators of change in their GES definition, including the harbour porpoise and the harbour seal. 

Four Member States (EE, LT, SE, PL) have provided threshold values for most of their indicators, making their GES definition measurable and specific. The other two Member States (FI, DK) refer to the long-term sustainability of populations and the balance of the food web without providing more details of what is meant with this. Three Member States (DK, FI, SE) have specified a baseline for their GES definitions as ‘reference conditions’, i.e. in line with prevailing conditions. 

Only one Member State (FI) refers to energy transfers between trophic levels in its GES definition. "	1	Low

One Member State (DE) has provided a global definition for D1, D4 and D6, which is only tenuously related to D6. None of the other seven Member States of the marine region have defined GES the same way.              The level of coherence across the Baltic marine region for the definition of Good Environmental Status for Descriptor 6 is low.	"As for Descriptor 4, two Member States (DK, FI) have defined D6 at the level of the criteria for the two criteria of the Commission Decision. The other four Member States (EE, LT, LV, SE) have defined D6 at the level of the indicator, but not necessarily covering all indicators and criteria. Three Member States (EE, LV, PL) have defined D6 only for the second criterion on the condition of the benthic community and have not addressed impacts on the seafloor. 

Three out of the four Member States that have defined GES for criterion 6.1 (DK, FI, SE) refer to the reduction of physical pressures from human activities on the seabed, either directly or indirectly (through reference to impacts) but none provide more information about which specific activities may cause pressure to the seafloor or specify the substrate types that may be impacted. The other Member State (LT) does not refer to activities causing pressure but has included an indicator (under development) on the extent of the area impacted. 

Criterion 6.2 on the condition of the benthic community is much more specified through quantitative indicators. Four Member States (LT, LV, SE, PL) have included the Benthic Quality Index, related to indicator 6.2.2 and to the Water Framework Directive. Another Member State (EE) has included several indices (zoobenthos community index (ZKI), hard bottom index and habitat diversity index of phytobenthic zone (FDI)). Only two Member States (DK, FI) have provided general and unspecific definitions, referring to the functioning of the benthic community, but not using any of the WFD or other indicators that exist on the condition of the benthic community. 

Only one Member State (DK) mentions a baseline, using it in the sense of reference/ prevailing conditions. Two Member States (FI, SE) refer to levels that maintain or safeguard the functioning of the benthic community. The other three Member States (EE, LT, LV) have defined GES through WFD indicators, as mentioned before, and do not provide baselines. "	1	Low
BAL	D6	Art 8 Pressures	Commission	Milieu	2019-09-20	http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/implementation/pdf/national_reports.zip	The level of coherence in the approaches used for the initial assessments on physical damage and loss across the Baltic marine region is moderate (even though the level of details varies greatly from one Member State to another). 	"Most of the Member States have undertaken an initial assessment on both physical loss and physical damage; only one Member State (LV) has just provided information on physical loss. One Member State (PL) has not reported any information on the pressures in the reporting sheets or the paper report. However, in the reporting sheets, the same Member State (PL) has reported that the main pressure on habitats in all geographic areas is physical loss and smothering. 

Most Member States have covered different types of physical loss and physical damage, albeit at different levels of detail. The information reported by some Member States is comprehensive (e.g. DK), in other cases the information is rather limited (e.g. EE, LV). All Member States have listed the main causes of pressure – the construction and maintenance of ports (physical loss) and trawling fisheries (physical damage) are the most referred to. The impacts of physical loss and physical damage are covered by all Member States but in most cases (DE, EE, FI, LT, LV, SE) with very little detail. 

As a rule, Member States do not refer expressly to WFD reports and only in few cases HELCOM is directly mentioned (e.g. FI, SE). Two Member States (DK, LT) presented clear conclusive judgements on the current status of both physical loss and physical damage, one (FI) reported this type of judgements only for physical damage and other (LV) only for physical loss.

In the reporting sheets, one Member State (DK) reported that less than 1% of their seabed habitats is affected by physical loss; two Member States (EE, LT) reported 1-5%. The remaining Member States did not report anything. For physical damage, two Member State (EE, LT) reported that 1-5% of their seabed habitats is affected and one Member State (DK) reported 75 to 100%. The other Member States did not report anything.

BAL	D6	Art 8 Biological features	Commission	Milieu	2019-09-20	http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/implementation/pdf/national_reports.zip	All Member States have undertaken an initial assessment of biological features. All Member States have reported on habitats and species/functional groups, but only some addressed ecosystems (DK, EE, LT, LV).                 The level of coherence of the initial assessments on biological features across the Baltic marine region is considered as relatively low. 	"Habitats
Most Member States covered at least a good share of the relevant seabed habitat types, but many Member States (DE, DK, EE, LT, PL) did not cover, or covered in a very limited way, water column habitat types. The majority of Member States used the MSFD classification of predominant habitats or an equivalent system (in particular EUNIS Level 2 classification). 

In the reporting sheets, only one Member State (DK) reported on listed habitats from the Habitats Directive and three Member States (DE, FI and PL) reported on habitats from the HELCOM list. Four Member States (DE, DK, FI, LV) have reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. The predominant habitat types which have been most reported are shallow sand (three Member States), shelf mixed sediment (three Member States) and shallow mud (three Member States).

When assessing habitats or habitat types, Member States focused on habitat distribution and extent, but not so much on habitats condition or on the main causes of pressure. The main pressures on habitats reported by the Member States are nutrient enrichment, physical loss and damage.  

Most Member States (EE, FI, LT, LV, PL and SE) provided a clear and conclusive judgement on the current status of the habitats, but almost always only for a selection of habitats. A number of Member States (e.g. EE, FI, LV) have judged some of their habitats to be in good status. However, some of these Member States (e.g. EE, LV) have made this judgement even though the habitat distribution, extent or condition was assessed as being altered in relation to natural conditions. In some cases (e.g. EE, LV), this is in line with the fact that the GES definition does not require habitats to be in line with natural conditions to be at GES.  

For the assessment of status, the Habitats Directive is mentioned by all Member States but one (DE). HELCOM is explicitly referred to by at least some Member States (e.g. DK, FI, PL and SE).

Species/functional groups 
Three Member States (DE, DK, LV) used a mixed approach to report on species and functional groups. Two Member States reported only on species groups (FI, SE) and the remaining two Member State reported only on functional groups (EE, LT).  One Member State (PL) has reported on species groups, functional groups and individual species.

Almost all Member States covered at least birds, fish and mammals. In a number of cases, where the information reported did not cover all relevant species groups the justification provided for the gaps was not considered sufficient (e.g. DE, DK, EE). One Member State (LT) did not report on mammals due to the lack of sufficient information. Three Member States have reported on bird functional groups (DE, DK, LT), four Member States have reported on fish functional groups (DK, EE, LT, LV) and two Member States have reported on mammal functional groups (DK, EE). One Member State (PL) carried out the majority of its assessment on birds (wintering birds and white-tailed eagle). The functional groups most reported on were, for birds, birds inshore benthic, birds inshore pelagic and birds offshore pelagic (three Member States), for fish, demersal fish and pelagic fish (four Member States) and for mammals, seals (two Member States).

In the reporting sheets, none of the Member State reported on listed species from the Birds and Habitats Directive. Only two Member State (FI and PL) reported on listed species from the HELCOM.

For the majority of Member States, the reports include information on species abundance and condition and on the main pressures. Those reported most often as the main pressures on species are extraction of species (all species) and physical loss (smothering). 

All Member States provided at least a qualitative/descriptive judgement of the current status of some (e.g. LT) or all (e.g. EE) of the species/functional groups reported on. Six Member States (DE, DK, EE, FI, LT) have judged some of their species/functional groups to be in good status although for one Member State (PL) the sampling size has decreased significantly (from 24 in 2005 to 4 in 2009) risking the results to be less accurate. As for habitats, some of these judgements (e.g. from DE, LT) have been made even though the species composition/population is reported to be altered in relation to natural conditions. Four Member States (DE, EE, FI, LT) have reported some of their species/functional groups to be not in good status. 

Only a few Member States have not systematically referred to the Habitats and Birds Directives (e.g. LT) or to HELCOM (e.g. DK, LV and PL) in their assessment of species/functional groups.

Ecosystems
Only four Member States (DK, EE, LT, LV) have reported on ecosystems. They usually provide very little and reported on the main pressures. Three Member State (DK, EE, LT) provided a conclusive judgement on the current status of their ecosystems in their paper report. In one of the cases (DK) the assessment was negative, in another other case (EE) the majority of the indicators assessed were considered to be at GES, and in the remaining case (LT) the majority of the indicators assessed were considered not to be at GES.

BAL	D6	Art 10	Commission	Milieu	2019-09-20	http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/implementation/pdf/national_reports.zip	All Member States have defined environmental targets for the biodiversity descriptors, except LV which has not defined targets for Descriptor 4.                          The level of coherence in the setting of targets and indicators across the Baltic marine region is considered to be moderate. 	"Four Member States (DK, EE, FI and PL) have defined separate targets for D1, D4 and D6. Each of these countries has defined at least two targets per descriptor, with Descriptor 1 generally counting the most targets and Descriptor 6 the least. One Member State (SE) has combined the targets for Descriptors 1 and 4 and reported the targets for Descriptor 6 separately but has reported only four targets in total. One Member State (LV) has reported one target and associated indicators (the same as for the GES definition) for Descriptor 1 and one target for Descriptor 6 but has not reported targets for Descriptor 4. 

Two Member States (DE, LT) have addressed with one set of targets the three descriptors. One of these two Member States (LT) has reported only a single target in their reporting sheets along with a number of specific indicators (mainly the same as their GES indicators). These two countries have reported targets at a low level of detail. 

The biodiversity targets represent a mix of state, impact and pressure targets, with a domination of state and impact targets. The pressures addressed are mainly those related to fishing activities and/or causing physical damage to the seafloor (including selective extraction of species, bottom trawling, by-catch, discards, etc.) in particular in relation to D6. Two Member States (LT, LV) have not included any pressure targets. 

Most Member States (DE, DK, EE, FI, PL and SE) have defined targets/indicators for specific species. The inclusion of these species in the Member States’ targets can be because they are considered sensitive/threatened and in need of protection (e.g. listed species from the Habitats and Birds Directive or from the HELCOM Convention), they have a particular function/ role in the ecosystem (e.g. habitat-forming species, slowly-reproducing species, top predators, etc.), they are particular sensitive to certain pressures (e.g. fishing, by-catch) or they are well-studied and monitored. Examples of such species commonly addressed by the targets are harbour, ringed and grey seals. 

Four of the Member States have addressed the main three species groups in their targets: fish, birds, mammals (DK, EE, FI and PL), one Member State (DE) has focused on birds, mammals and benthic species and one Member State (SE) has focused only on fish. A few Member States have covered shellfish, sometimes as part of the seabed habitat associated communities (DE, DK). None of the Member States have addressed cephalopods. 

In terms of habitat types, all Member States have addressed benthic habitats in a general manner or through the condition of the benthic community, in particular using a number of indices/indicators related to the condition of the benthic community (e.g. BQI). Water column habitats are less frequently covered by the biodiversity targets. Only two Member States (DK, FI) have defined targets related to the planktonic community.

Only three Member States (DE, FI and PL) have included targets that relate to regional, EU or international objectives, such as HELCOM, the Habitats and Birds Directive, the Common Fisheries Policy, the Water Framework Directive or the Convention on Biological Diversity. Two Member States (DK, FI) have defined a target related to the establishment of Marine Protected Areas; one other (DE) has set targets related to resettlements of endangered populations and the creation of migration corridors.

In terms of quantification, four Member States (DK, EE, LT, LV) out of eight have defined thresholds and baselines for their targets and associated indicators but for three of them (EE, LT, LV) they have used the same indicators for their targets as for their GES. Therefore only one Member State (DK) has defined quantitative parameters for targets that should help achieve GES rather than being an expression of GES. 

The other four Member States (DE, FI, Pl and SE) have defined potentially measurable targets and indicators but have come short of setting threshold values and baselines that would make them fully SMART. However, these sets of targets are considered to be more in line with the objectives of the Directive as they are designed to help achieve GES rather than being expressions of GES. "	2	Moderate

The level of coherence in the definition of GES for D2 across the Member States of the Baltic region is considered to be low.

None of the Baltic Member States has defined GES in relation to indicator 2.2.1, with one exception (EE). 

The definitions of GES set by the Baltic Member States vary in terms of their level of details. Some (DE, DK, FI, PL) are defined in general terms or reflect only the definition of GES in the MSFD Annex I. Others have provided a rather detailed definition. In particular, one Member State (EE) defines GES through indicators targeting specific species groups and including thresholds. However, it should be noted that this Member State (EE) uses the same indicators for Article 10, which raises some doubts as to what is exactly GES definition. 

One Member State (SE) refers to GMOs and species with altered genetic characteristics within its definition of GES. Two Member States refer to the HELCOM bio-pollution index (EE, LT). One Member State (EE) targets specific groups of species in its definition at indicator level (pelagic invertebrate, benthic invertebrate, zooplankton and macrozoobenthic biomass).

In general, the level of coherence of the GES definitions of the Member States in the Baltic marine region is considered to be moderate. 	"One Member State (DK) has defined GES only at the descriptor level, which is a general statement, less specific than the definition as provided in MSFD Annex I. The remaining six Member States have all applied criteria 3.1 and 3.2 (DE, EE, FI, LT, LV, SE) and four out of those six Member States (DE, FI, SE, PL) have also applied criterion 3.3 from the Commission Decision. One Member State (EE) has defined GES in way that does not correspond and is not comparable to the descriptor and criteria as defined in the Commission Decision but does use some of the indicators of the Commission Decision applied to specific species.

In regard to criterion 3.1, most Member States that have clearly defined it have used F as the primary indicator and have used Fmsy in their GES definition. Two Member States (DE, FI) have clearly stated that all fish and shellfish should be exploited at or below Fmsy while another (SE) has set this threshold only for fish species (and not for shellfish species). Another MS (PL) has applied the criterion 3.1 only to the six main fish stocks in the Baltic. Three Member States (EE, LT, LV) have provided ICES MSY reference points for several relevant stocks. One of these two Member States (LV) has also stated that stocks should be exploited below Fmsy but it is not clear whether this is applied to all stocks. For those stocks for which F cannot be determined, two Member States (DE, SE) have applied the secondary indicator 3.1.2 on the catch/biomass ratio from the Commission Decision. 

For criterion 3.2, four Member States (DE, LV, SE, PL), which have defined GES beyond the descriptor level, have applied the primary indicator SSB. Three of those Member States (DE, LV) have explicitly defined SSBpa as a threshold for some or all stocks and three (DE, SE, PL) have applied BMSY-trigger. Three Member States have applied the secondary indicator 3.2.2 biomass indices (DE, EE, SE). One of the Member States (FI) has included a more general statement for fish stocks to be healthy. One Member States has not defined criteria 3.2 (LT).

"All Member States have undertaken an initial assessment for Descriptor 3 but at varying levels of detail, including one at a very low level of detail (EE). Several Baltic countries have used MSY and PA reference points but across the countries, there are differences in the reference points used. 

Three of the Member States (DE, DK, LV) have assessed stocks in relation to the Fmsy reference point. Two Member States (DE, DK) used BMSY-trigger as a reference point to assess at least one stock while one (LV) has assessed stocks in relation to the SSBpa reference points. Two of the Member States (EE, LT) have covered stocks in other ways. 

In terms of the level of the pressure caused by fishing fleets, a few Member States have assessed the extent of their assessment areas subjected to the pressure from various fleet categories. The assessments are very diverse even within Member States (depending on the fleet category) and are difficult to summarize. For instance, for the category “vessels >12m – mobile gears – affecting seabed (i.e. trawls, dredges)”, the information ranges from less than 1% (EE) to 50-75% (DK) to 75-100% (DE). 

In terms of impacts on seabed habitats, four Member States (DE, DK, EE, LT) have provided, in the reporting sheets, a quantification of the extent of the seabed affected by the fishing pressure. The assessment ranges from less than 1% of the assessment area (EE) to 20-50% (PL, LT) to 50-75% (DK) to 75-100% (DE) of seabed habitats impacted. One Member State (DE) has also reported that 11 fish functional groups out of 15 are impacted by the pressure (73%). The differences in the assessments of the extent of seabed affected by the fishing pressure are large whereas trawl fisheries should impact seabed relatively equally throughout the Baltic.

HELCOM is seldom mentioned by Member States in their initial assessment of commercial fisheries. Some Member States (e.g. DK) have referred to HELCOM HOLAS while others (e.g. SE, LT) have used HELCOM assessments on coastal fish community status. ICES is more commonly referenced. "	2	Moderate

A number of Member States, however, have not provided much information on organic matter inputs (EE, DE, LV, LT) and one Member State provided estimates that are nearly 15 years old (FI). 

Similarly, levels of organic materials in the marine environment are provided by very few Member States (e.g. SE) and dissolved oxygen levels is provided by some Member States (e.g. DE, DK). Agriculture, forestry and urban discharges are indicated as the main cause of eutrophication by all Member States.

Trends on the level of pressure are presented by most countries, ranging between “declining” (e.g. LT) and “stable” (e.g. EE).

The information provided on impacts is usually less complete than for pressures. All Member States have assessed impacts on both seabed and pelagic habitats, although some countries (e.g. DK or SE) provided considerably more detailed information than others (e.g. LV). Phytoplankton impacts are well recorded/understood by all countries but use of the depth of submerged aquatic vegetation indicator appears to have resulted in very little information being provided on the abundance of opportunistic macroalgae. All countries have presented a judgement on impacts, but most of the time only on some elements. Where made, judgements often appear to be sound, based on the information provided, and indicate in most cases that GES has not been achieved. One Member State (EE) has looked at each GES indicator separately, concluding that GES is considered to be achieved for four, not achieved for five and needing further development for two indicators. The majority of Member States refers to the WFD (DE, DK, EE, FI) and/or HELCOM (DE, EE, FI, LT, SE, PL) in their initial assessments.

In the reporting sheets, only two Member States (DE, DK) have provided a quantification of the proportion of the water column which is impacted by nutrient and organic matter enrichment, both of them reporting 75-100%.

No Member State has referred to other existing regulatory regimes to be complied with (e.g. EIA, SEA, Habitats and Birds Directives) and none of the Member States incorporate clear quantitative thresholds in their definition of GES. "	1	Low

"All Member States have undertaken an initial assessment for D7 except for one (LV). 

All Member States that reported have produced a very basic and general assessment, without proper analysis of pressures and impacts and focused only on some parameters (usually temperature and salinity, sometimes currents). The Member States that reported in more detail (DE, LT and SE) have in any cases reported essentially on local pressures and concluded that no large scale impact exist for this descriptor. This is however not supported by relevant studies about pressure-impact relations or about the impacts on parameters potentially related to Descriptor 7. 

Clear plans to address the existing knowledge gaps are provided by only one Member State (DE). No Member State explicitly refers to WFD reports while all of them focus on the coastal zones. 

Most countries report, in the reporting sheets, that less than 1% of their assessment area is affected by changed hydrological processes, with the exception of one (LT) which reports 75%-100%.

Latvia has not defined GES for this descriptor. Taking into account the level of development of this descriptor, the level of coherence in the definitions of GES for D8 across the Baltic marine region is considered moderate.	"Seven Member States out of eight have defined GES for Descriptor 8. Latvia has not defined GES for this descriptor.

Two Member States (DK, LT) out of the seven that have defined GES for Descriptor 8 have not covered both criteria of the Commission Decision. One of the two (DK) has defined GES only at descriptor level, with very little specification of what is required for the achievement of GES. The other one (LT) has defined GES more specifically at indicator level but has covered only criterion 8.1 on concentrations of contaminants. 

Only two Member States (DE, SE) out of the five that have defined GES for criterion 8.1 have referred to the three matrices for measurement of concentrations (water, biota and sediment). Another two Member States (EE, FI) have used water and biota while the last Member State (LT) has used water and sediment as matrices for measurement.  

Five Member States (DE, EE, LT, SE, PL) have, directly or indirectly, included compliance to the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) Directive as a requirement to achieve GES. One Member State (FI) refers to “levels that do not cause direct or indirect negative impacts”, which could potentially cover compliance with the EQS but is not stated explicitly. 

Only four Member States (DE, EE, LT) have made a direct reference to HELCOM in their definition of criterion 8.1. Three Member States (EE, LT, PL) refer to or use the HELCOM GES boundaries for measurements of certain contaminants in biota (EE, PL) or sediment (LT, PL), in complement to the EQS. The third Member State (DE) requires compliance with the environmental objectives of the “hazardous substances” segment of the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP), which includes using the HELCOM standards for measurements in biota and sediment (and compliance with the EQS for measurements in water). 

For the Member States that apply both the EQS and HELCOM GES boundaries, none has explained which approach they will use for the measurement of mercury in biota, for which both EQS and HELCOM GES boundaries apply. Only one Member State (DE) has mentioned potential issues of complementarity and the need to apply the precautionary principle but without setting a clear hierarchy between the two approaches. 

Four Member States (EE, LT, PL, SE) have been specific with regard to the substances covered by their GES definition. The substances selected cover all (EE, LT) or some (SE, PL) of the priority hazardous substances from EU legislation and from HELCOM. For the other country that has referred to the EQS in its GES definition (DE), it may be assumed that all EU priority substances are covered but there is a lack of specification. One Member State (DE) has covered radionuclides in the scope of its GES definition. 

Only one Member State (LT) has defined aggregation rules in its GES definition directly, based on the HELCOM CHASE approach, leaving open the question whether the “all in, all out” rule should apply to all the other Member States. 

With regards to effects of contaminants, five Member States (DE, EE, FI, PL, SE) have defined GES for criterion 8.2. Four out of these four Member States (DE, FI, PL and SE) refer to negative biological effects of contaminants on marine organisms, such as shell thickness or disturbance on reproduction. They either directly mention specific effects that should be measured to assess the achievement of GES (SE) or provide a general list of possible negative effects (FI, PL) or refer to the recommendations from HELCOM and ICES on the topic (DE). The fourth country (EE) looks at the issue only from the perspective of concentration levels in biota.

With regard to acute pollution events, only one Member State (DE) mentions the oiling rate of seabirds although another country (FI) refers to a number of general effects that could be caused by oil. The frequency and/or extent of events are addressed only by two Member State (DE, SE). In addition, one Member State (LT) has included petroleum hydrocarbons in the list of substances which concentrations should be measured in water and sediment, indirectly covering oil spills.

BAL	D8 	Art 8 	Commission	Milieu	2019-09-20	http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/implementation/pdf/national_reports.zip	All Member States have undertaken an initial assessment for D8.                                   There is a high level of coherence across the Baltic marine region in the approaches used by the Member States to carry out the initial assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, radioactive substances and acute pollution events (although to a lesser extent for the latter). 	"All Member States have undertaken an initial assessment for D8. All Member States have provided a detailed, quantitative or trend-based, assessment of the level of contamination. Assessment of contamination by heavy metals is better detailed than for man-made substances for a number of countries (LT, LV, SE). Most countries have provided a list of the contaminants considered in their assessment. The most common man-made substances assessed include PAHs, PFCs, PBDE, PCBs, HCH, TBT, DDT and the most common heavy metals assessed include cadmium, lead and mercury.

All Member States refer to land- and sea-based sources of contamination, with more details provided for land-based pollution. The main contributors of hazardous substances to the marine environment are rivers carrying loads from industrial processes or municipal discharges. Wastewater treatment plants are also often referred to. Common sea-based sources of contamination include shipping, dredging and offshore oil and gas activities. Few Member States (DE, LT, LV) report on air-based sources of contamination (e.g. industrial and commercial combustion processes). 

All Member States have directly referred to HELCOM in their assessment. Four Five out of eightseven (DK, FI, LV, PL and SE) have directly used the results from HELCOM assessments (either HOLAS or HELCOM’s specific hazardous substances assessment) to conclude on the status of their marine waters. Some Member States (EE, SE) have referred to other HELCOM processes (e.g. COMBINE or CORESET) or to the HELCOM BSAP (FI). Only two countries (EE, LT) have referred to the WFD monitoring methodology.

All Member States but one (LV) have made a judgement on the current level of contamination in their marine waters. The judgements made are either in relation to GES (e.g. LT) or on the basis of HELCOM HOLAS results (e.g. DK). The judgements made are shared between not acceptable/not good/poor (DK, FI, LT, SE) and good/acceptable (DE, EE, PL). However, most Member States have not made only one aggregated judgement and therefore the results present more subtlety than can be described here. 

In the reporting sheet, five Member States (DE, DK, EE, FI, LV) have made a quantified assessment of the proportion of their assessment area which is subject to raised levels of hazardous substances. For synthetic substances, it ranges from 1-5% (EE, FI), 5-25% (PL – Bornholm Basin only; no assessment reported for other areas) to 75-100% (DE, DK). For heavy metals it ranges from 1-5% (EE, PL) to 5-25% (DE ) to 75-100% (DK, FI, LV).

Most Member States (DE, EE, FI, LT, LV, PL, SE) have assessed impacts on seabed habitats through the assessment of the concentration levels of contaminants in sediment. Only one Member State (DK) has made an assessment of other impacts on seabed habitats and associated communities, using the limit values set by the American Environmental Protection Agency for effects on living organisms. In the reporting sheets, one Member State (LT) has assessed that less than 1% of its seabed habitats are impacted by hazardous substances yet has made a judgement that the current level of impacts on seabed habitats is not acceptable (not at GES). It is not certain what this judgement is based on. Another Member State (DE) has assessed that 5-25% of its seabed habitats are impacted by hazardous substances contamination. 

All Member States have assessed impacts on species and functional groups. The biological effects most often reported on include imposex, fish disease, lysosomal membrane stability, EROD. Three Member States (EE, FI, LV) have assessed impacts on species and functional groups only through an assessment of the concentration levels of contaminants in fish and shellfish. In the reporting sheets, two Member States (FI, LT) have made a judgement that the current levels of impacts on functional groups are not acceptable (not at GES). One of the two Member States (LT) has reported that three out of six functional groups are impacted by synthetic substances contamination and two out of six by heavy metal contamination. The other Member State (FI) has reported that 75-100% of functional groups in its assessment area are subject to raised levels of hazardous substances in individuals, species or populations. 

All Member States have made an assessment of contamination by radionuclides – some of them in great details (e.g. EE) –, including a quantitative or trend-based assessment (in particular of C-137) and description of main sources. The importance of the Chernobyl accident is highlighted by most countries, along with other sources of contamination such as nuclear facilities discharges and nuclear weapons testing. Current levels of contamination by radionuclides are assessed as low or acceptable by three countries (SE, DE, LT) and reported as being a number of times higher than pre-Chernobyl levels by two countries (FI, LV). 

All Member States but one (PL)  have made an assessment of contamination by acute pollution events but one of the Member States (EE) that had assessed it (EE) does not report at all on oil spills and oil pollution, only on waste discharges.  Four Member States (DE, DK, FI, LV) report on the number of oil spills or related events. Only one Member State (LT) has assessed the impacts from acute pollution events on marine organisms, reporting that four out of eight seabirds and fish functional groups are impacted.

In terms of data and knowledge gaps, very few Member States have reported substantially on this (SE, DE). The information gaps mentioned concern the need to develop assessment criteria to assess the impacts on ecosystem components and the difficulties to aggregate the different assessments to make a judgement in relation to GES. Gaps are also noted in terms of methodologies to make common assessments of radioactive contamination and contamination by oil pollution. "	3	High

The number of targets, not counting associated indicators, varies from 2 (DE, DK, SE) to 4-5(PL, DE) and 7 (FI). One Member State (LT) has provided a list of indicators (corresponding to its GES indicators) but no overall target. The level of detail in the targets varies from one Member State to the other. Most Member States have set measurable targets because these are defined against specific reference levels (e.g. EQS, EAC) but they are often rather an expression of GES than targets defined to help achieve GES. Only three Member States (DE, FI and SE to a certain extent) have defined a set of targets and indicators that cover different elements that will help achieve GES (e.g. different sources of contamination).

These three Member State (DE, FI, SE) have defined targets/indicators that are geared towards reducing input of contaminants to the sea from land-, sea- and air-based sources. The specific sources targeted include rivers, coastal point sources, oil and gas installations and shipping.

The other four Member States (DK, EE, LT, PL) have defined targets/indicators that are solely geared towards the non-exceedance of reference levels. The reference levels used by these Member States are the same as those used for their GES definition. All four Member State have specified the contaminants that should be measured (same as for GES). Only two Member States (FI, PL) have defined targets for radionuclides.

Five Member States out of eight (DE, DK, FI, SE) have defined one or several targets/indicators focused on indicator 8.2.1 on biological effects. Most targets are general. Only one Member State (FI) has set detailed and numerous targets/indicators on specific biological effects to be measured. Only one Member State (DK) uses imposex as an indicator for its target on biological effects. Finally, one Member State (DE) refers to internationally agreed criteria for biological effects (ICES/HELCOM CORESET). 

The same five Member States have also defined one or several targets/indicators for indicator 8.2.2 on acute pollution events, in line with their GES definitions. They all (directly or indirectly) reflect the necessity to reduce the number of events. While one Member State (PL) states that these should be reduced to minimum without assessing it further, two others (DE, DK) mention the extent of the incidents. Two (DE, FI) mention the impact of oil on marine organisms, and more particularly on birds (as per OSPAR EcoQO) for one country (DE). One Member State (DE) mentions the MARPOL Convention.

Overall, the level of coherence in the definitions of GES for Descriptor 9 in the Baltic marine region is moderate.	"All seven Member States have defined GES for Descriptor 9. 

Only one Member State (SE) has defined GES using the entirety of criterion 9.1 of the Commission Decision, i.e. including an indicator on the maximum frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded. However, even that Member State has not specified threshold values for this indicator, meaning that GES cannot actually be measured. The other Member States have defined GES only for the first part of criterion 9.1 on the concentration levels of contaminants. 

All Member States but one (DK) refer to or use levels set in EU legislation. This Member State has defined GES at a very general level, with no reference to any standards, substances, species or anything to make it measurable. 

For four Member States (DE, FI, PL and SE), the reference to EU legislation is made directly in the definition, with additional details on what it entails (i.e. compliance with Regulation 1881/2006) in the accompanying text. The other three Member States (EE, LT, LV) have instead set fixed limit values in their definition, which are consistent with the current EU foodstuffs limit values but will not reflect future amendments to the EU legislation. This means that by 2020 these Member States may not be in compliance with EU foodstuffs legislation anymore. Two of the three Member States (EE, LV) do refer to EU legislation in their accompanying text, indicating that their GES may evolve with the legislation but none actually refers to Regulation 1881/2006 (one refers to other foodstuffs legislation (EE) and the other refers to the EQS and to an outdated pieces of foodstuffs legislation (LV)). 

One Member State (DE) indirectly covers microbial pathogens in its GES definition (by referring to compliance to Directive 2006/113/EC in its accompanying text).

Five Member States (EE, LT, LV, PL and SE) include details about the specific substances that are covered in the GES definition. For two Member States (DE, FI), the lack of specification seems to indicate that all relevant substances for fish and seafood in Regulation 1881/2006 are covered. Two Member States (EE, SE) provide information on the specific species to be used for the sampling (e.g. the Baltic herring, sprat, eel, etc.) while another two Member States give indication of the type of species or the type of samples to be used (e.g. bivalve molluscs soft tissue, fish muscle).

Overall, there is a relatively high level of coherence across the Baltic marine region in the approaches used to assess the level of contamination of fish and seafood.	"All Member States have undertaken an initial assessment for D9. Most assessments related to fish and seafood are done in conjunction with the assessment of contamination of the environment and ecosystem components by hazardous substances (see previous section). Only one Member State (SE) mentions the discrepancy between regulatory levels for contaminants in the environment and for contaminants in foodstuffs (i.e. the latter being less strict). 

All Member States but one (DK) provide details regarding the substances assessed. For all but one (DK), the assessment covers both synthetic and non-synthetic substances. The most common substances used for this assessment are dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs for synthetic substances and mercury for non-synthetic substances. All Member States also provide information regarding the species assessed, which include inter alia herring, cod, salmon, sprat, sea trout, perch and flounder. Few Member States (DK, LV) have assessed contamination levels in shellfish species.

All Member States have made a quantitative assessment of the current concentration levels of contaminants in these various species against the levels specified in Regulation 1881/2006. However only two Member States (EE, LV) have provided, in the reporting sheets, a quantification of the proportion of fish and seafood samples tested, in which maximum levels have been exceeded. One Member State reports only 1-5% of the samples as being above limit values while another Member State (LT) reports that 75-100% of the samples exceed limit values for heavy metals but less than 1% for synthetic substances. 

In all cases, Member States have provided an aggregated judgement on the current levels of contamination in fish and seafood for human consumption: acceptable (i.e. status is good) four Member States (DK, EE, LV and PL), not acceptable (i.e. status is not good) for four Member State (DE, FI, LT, SE). No Member State has discussed the issue of the origin of the samples used for the assessment.  

All Member States but two (LV and PL) have made an assessment of the levels of contamination of bathing waters by microbial pathogens but only one (DE) has assessed contamination of its shellfish waters, using as threshold values the standards of Directives 2006/113/EC (Shellfish Water Directive).

One Member State (LT) reports the same indicators as for its GES definition and no overall target.

The countries that have set specific environmental targets for D9 have all defined the same type of target, requiring concentration levels of substances to be below EU foodstuffs limit values. Most Member States (DK, EE, FI, LT, LV and PL) have defined precisely which substances are covered by the target. None of the Member States provide details of the specific species to be used for measurements, only a few make a difference between substances to be measured in fish (or fish parts, e.g. muscle) and those to be measured in shellfish (e.g. LV).

Because of the systematic reference to the EU standards, all of these targets are considered to be measurable even when they are not detailed (i.e. there is no need to define specific threshold values and baselines). One Member State (DE) has also included compliance with Directive 2006/113/EC on the quality of shellfish water to deal with microbial pathogens. Only two Member States (DE, SE) have defined targets or indicators that relate to the reduction of a pressure but actually these targets have been defined for D8 and applied to D9.

No Member State from the Baltic region has included the issue of the origin of the samples in their environmental target.

One Member State (DE) provided a definition which is not (or only roughly) in line with the definitions of the 2010 Commission Decision and the remaining Member State (DK) provided a definition of GES that appears to have been based on a different interpretation (that could be considered as misinterpretation) of the 2010 Commission Decision. 

Although all the Member States defined GES at descriptor and criteria levels, two Member States (DK and PL) did not (clearly) make use of both criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision.

However, the sources of the pressures have some common denominators with shipping being the major source of noise, followed by wind turbines/construction work, fisheries and seismic surveys. 

Generally, in the very few remarks on the functional groups impacted by noise levels, it is not specified whether impacts come from either impulsive or continuous sound or both.
