Art13/2016/BE/Rec03;The Member State should establish more links with existing EU policies and international instruments for the biodiversity descriptors, contaminant in seafood (D9) and underwater noise and energy (D11). ;BE;D9, D11;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;These two are descriptor specific
Art13/2016/BE/Rec04;The Member State should provide more information about its spatial protection measures (representation of species and habitats within the MPAs, the size, number and location of MPAs, the conservation objectives of the MPAs).;BE;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BE/Rec05;The Member State should quantify the pressures present in its waters and their expected level of reduction as a result of the established measures. This could be facilitated by further efforts to address knowledge gaps and define the methodology for such estimations at regional or EU level. Such quantification will also contribute to linking the measures with the achievement of GES.;BE;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BE/Rec06;The Member State should define the spatial scope of its measures (both existing and new) in detail. Furthermore, the spatial scope of measures should be expanded to cover marine waters beyond coastal waters, where relevant pressures are present. The Member State should consider establishing additional measures beyond spatial protection efforts to address species and habitats. It is important that pressures are addressed across all marine waters.;BE;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BE/Rec07;The Member State should make better links between the groups of measures reported for pressure descriptors and their effects on the state descriptors.

Art13/2016/BG/Rec03;The Member State should provide GES and targets definitions for underwater noise (D11).;BG;D11;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BG/Rec04;The Member State should provide an assessment on when GES will be achieved.;BG;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BG/Rec05;The Member State should establish more links with existing EU policies and international instruments for contaminant in seafood (D9), eutrophication (D5), hydrographical changes (D7) and underwater noise and energy (D11).;BG;D9, D5, D7, D11;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BG/Rec06;The Member State should clearly identify the timelines for implementation of all measures as well as secured funding.;BG;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BG/Rec07;The Member State should provide more information about its spatial protection measures (representation of species and habitats within the MPAs, the size and location of MPAs, the conservation objectives of the MPAs).;BG;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BG/Rec08;The Member State should quantify the pressures present in its waters and their expected level of reduction as a result of the established measures.

This would allow a comprehensive view of the impact of measures affecting all descriptors.;BG;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BG/Rec10;The Member State should ensure better linkages between its PoM and Monitoring Programmes, in order to ensure that the effects of the measures, and hence their efficiency and effectiveness in meeting targets and GES, are measured through the Monitoring Programmes.;BG;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BG/Rec11;The Member State should report data collection efforts under the MSFD Monitoring Programmes (Article 11) and not under the Programme of Measures (Article 13). However, when knowledge is too scarce to design effective measures, it is useful to indicate actions taken to address these gaps via research measures.;BG;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/BG/Rec12;The Member State should provide more information on estimating the reductions of pressures that are expected from the measures and how this will benefit species and habitats. Many of the monitoring programmes included detailed ecological information on the dynamics of species and habitats and deviations from natural trends and it is important that this information is put in context with the PoM and when such measures will allow for GES to be achieved for species and habitats.;BG;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec01;In general, the Member State should better address certain pressures and activities. These are specified in the descriptor specific recommendations below. ;CY;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec02;The Member State should consider whether it is feasible to reduce the current levels of certain pressures in the marine environment, given that the majority of direct measures focus on preventing ongoing and future inputs of pressures. It is observed that most measures aim to address ongoing and new inputs of pressures, whilst very few seek to remove or reduce what is already present in the marine environment due to past activities. More specifically, in a few cases (e.g. marine litter (D10) and, to a lesser extent, NIS (D2)) measures address past, ongoing, and future inputs (e.g. removal of marine litter from the marine environment, in addition to preventing ongoing and future inputs of marine litter). In other cases (e.g. contaminants (D8)), the Member State considers that it is not feasible or cost-effective to remove contaminants which have been introduced in the past and are still present in the marine environment, but rather focus on controlling ongoing and future inputs. In these cases, contaminants will continue to act as sources of the pressure on the marine environment for years to come, depending on their degradation rates.;CY;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec03;GES and targets definitions should be better addressed for birds, fish and cephalopods, marine mammals and reptiles, water column habitats (D1, 4) and seabed habitats (D1, 4, 6), commercial fish and shellfish (D3), marine litter (D10) and underwater noise (D11).;CY;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec04;The Member State should strive to determine the timelines for achieving GES (especially for D3, D7, D10, D11, D1, 4, 6). Furthermore, if GES is not expected to be achieved by 2020, then the Member State should estimate the alternative dates by when GES will be achieved.;CY;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec05;The Member State should establish links with existing EU policies and international agreements (e.g. for D3 and D11). This would improve the overall coherence and coverage of the PoM.;CY;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec06;The Member State should define the spatial scope of measures in detail. Furthermore, the spatial scope of measures should be expanded to cover marine waters beyond coastal waters, where relevant pressures are present. The Member State should consider establishing additional measures beyond spatial protection efforts to address species and habitats. It is important that pressures are addressed across its broader territory.;CY;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec07;The Member State should clearly identify the timelines for implementation of their new measures (i.e. for D2, D3, D5, D7, D10, D1, 4, 6), secured funding, and the entities in charge of implementation for all their measures.;CY;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec08;The Member State should quantify pressures and their expected reduction as a result of the established measures. This could be facilitated by further efforts to address knowledge gaps and define the methodology for such estimations at regional or EU level. Such quantification will also contribute to linking the measures with the achievement of GES.;CY;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec09;The Member State should ensure coherence of its determinations of GES, environmental targets and the PoM. This would allow to use environmental targets systematically as milestones towards achieving GES through the measures, and monitor this progress through the MSFD monitoring programmes. This is applicable mainly to birds, marine mammal and reptiles (D1, 4), NIS (D2), hydrographical changes (D7) and underwater noise and energy (D11).;CY;General;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec10;The Member State should report data collection efforts under the MSFD Monitoring Programmes (Article 11) and not under the Programme of Measures (Article 13).

Art13/2016/CY/Rec11;The Member State should address the introduction of NIS in its marine waters from shipping, land claim and coastal defence activities. ;CY;D2;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec12;The Member State should clarify the link of its PoM with the CFP.;CY;D3;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;

Art13/2016/CY/Rec16;The Member State should better address pressures from activities not subject to local/project scale EIAs (e.g. fishing, maritime transport). In some cases (e.g. hydrological changes where local dimension is important) this gap hampers the assessment of cumulative effects.;CY;D7;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec17;The Member State should establish measures to address marine litter from shipping or industrial sources.;CY;D10;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;

Art13/2016/CY/Rec19;The Member State should conduct additional research to address data gaps, increase knowledge and pave the way for direct action as soon as possible.  ;CY;D10;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec20;The Member State should make efforts to identify pollution hot spots (e.g. from plastic pellets, lost fishing gear, etc.) and reduce the mortality of turtles.;CY;D10;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec21;The Member State should establish direct measures to cover activities that are known to produce high levels of noise, as soon as possible (e.g. shipping, fisheries, recreational activities, industry (oil and gas), marine research and defence operation activities).;CY;D11;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec22;The Member State should address data gaps and consolidate research results to move closer to characterising the noise pressure, in line with the recommendation of TG Noise. This will enable defining more concrete and direct measures to address underwater noise in the second MSFD implementation cycle.;CY;D11;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec23;The Member State should consider establishing measures that target other energy inputs if possible (e.g., heat, light).;CY;D11;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec24;The Member State should establish additional measures targeting specific bird species.;CY;D1, 4 – Birds;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec25;The Member State should establish additional measures to address pressures on birds, namely, by-catch. Additional measures could target disturbances on nesting sites by predation, effects of NIS and litter ingestion, as well as measures covering birds’ food sources. If these are to be addressed via measures reported for other descriptors, the expected effect that measures are to have on birds should be explained.;CY;D1, 4 – Birds;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec26;The Member State should establish measures that extend beyond CFP efforts, and cover additional fish species and cephalopods, which are non-commercial species in open sea areas, as well as functional fish habitats (including spatial protection measures). ;CY;D1, 4 – Fish and cephalopods;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec27;The Member State should establish measures that include additional MPAs in open sea areas to protect non-commercial fish species from various pressures (NIS, by-catch, noise and contaminants). If these are to be addressed via measures reported for other descriptors, the expected effect that measures are to have on fish should be explained.;CY;D1, 4 – Fish and cephalopods;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
Art13/2016/CY/Rec28;The Member State should provide better information on existing MPAs and the level of protection they provide for fish (commercial and non-commercial), in relation to where fish species occur within Member States' territorial waters, and how they are protected.;CY;D1, 4 – Fish and cephalopods;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018SC0393;
