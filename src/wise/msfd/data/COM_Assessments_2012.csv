Belgium;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Belgium has set GES for Descriptor 1 at descriptor and criteria level in both the paper report (Definition of GES and environmental targets for Belgian marine waters) and the reporting sheet. GES is not set at indicator level. The definition at descriptor level reproduces verbatim the definition of Annex I of the MSFD. Belgium has chosen to combine for each criterion different elements which relate to several criteria.

At the criteria level, reference is made to the Habitats and Birds Directive, OSPAR and the WFD (for indicators 1.1 to 1.6) in terms of ‘attaining’ the good conditions these instruments set i.e. the WFD GEcS, the Habitats and Birds Directives favourable conservation status and OSPAR EcoQOs constitute the baseline for GES. The same element also refers to rare and threatened species and habitat types covered in existing legislation and conventions which should be protected at the level envisaged by that legislation or conventions. The reporting sheet and paper report do not specify which are these legal acts and conventions. GES is defined in principle in the same way for all species, functional groups and habitat types.

While the use of these other ‘standards’ is considered as appropriate and relevant for GES definition, it is not clear how they are being applied in the context of the Belgian marine waters. More importantly, one of the elements of GES definition (also applicable to criteria 1.1 to 1.6) establishes that the conditions described in the Initial Assessment is the minimum GES for the extent, distribution and condition of habitat types and constituting species populations. Criterion 1.7 also refers to the Initial Assessment for the maintenance of the different ecosystem components. A degraded state is used as a baseline without any ambition to improve quality towards a reference state (reference conditions). Ecosystem structure is not addressed in much detail. Some functional groups are referred to (key long-lived, slowly reproducing species, top predator species) but not at a detailed level. 

The definition of GES does not include any quantitative thresholds and the references to WFD and OSPAR standards are too vague to constitute measurable threshold values. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 1 is assessed partially adequate. GES has been defined for all criteria of the Commission Decision. However, there is a lack of detail at the criteria level with very general terms and phrases used which require further definition and detail in terms of how the relevant policies/directives are applied within the context of Belgian waters. The GES definition itself is clear, particularly in relation to each criteria and the corresponding relevant reference (i.e. Directive or convention) but would benefit from more specifics. In addition, a degraded state is used as a baseline.;"- Coverage of all criteria of the Commission Decision for D1 and coverage of all ecosystem components equally
- Lack of detail at criteria level, use of general terms
- Achievement of existing legislation/ agreements as basis for GES
- Use of 2012 initial assessment (degraded state) as baseline with no ambition to improve quality towards a reference state";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Belgium has reported on three species groups (birds, mammals and fish) and four birds functional groups (offshore benthic, offshore surface, offshore pelagic and offshore scavenger), two mammal functional groups (seals and toothed whales) and one fish functional group (diadromous fish). No justification is provided in the reporting sheets to explain why certain functional groups are not reported. Belgium does not report on individual species in the reporting sheet but information on individual species are included in the assessment of species groups. In the paper report, in addition to providing relatively detailed descriptions of the three species groups mentioned, Belgium provides a description of the species listed under the Birds and Habitats Directive but no mention is made of RSC lists. In the reporting sheet, there is also a mention that Natura 2000 special habitats will be reported under the Birds and Habitats Directive reporting in 2013. It should be noted that Belgium does not use the functional groups to report in its paper report. The correspondence between the classification used by Belgium and the MSFD classification is not clear. 

Little information is provided about the main pressures and human activities causing the pressures on the features reported. While the descriptions in the reporting sheet are rather limited they are a bit more detailed in the paper report, with some quantitative information on group abundance. For mammals and fish, Belgium has assessed the current state in relation to natural conditions (altered). However, there is no clear judgement on the status of birds or mammals in relation to GES, only basic descriptive text. More information is available for fish with a partial judgement on status trends and a qualitative judgement on current status. 

Habitats
The description of habitats in the reporting sheet is fragmented. In relation to the sea bed there is a lack of input for the littoral (intertidal zone) but some input is provided for shallow (i.e. identification of four subtidal communities which are each linked to a specific habitat) and shelf (i.e. gravel beds) habitat types. In relation to the water column, only a general description is provided with almost no input on coastal or shelf waters and there is no justification provided for why this is the case. Geographical descriptions are basic. In addition to reporting on several predominant habitat types (Shallow sublittoral sand, Shallow sublittoral mud, Shelf sublittoral coarse sediment, Shelf sublittoral mixed sediment, coastal and shelf) marine water Belgium has also reported on four additional habitats: H1110 and H1170 from the Habitats Directive and peatzones and artificial hard substrates, which are listed by Belgium as part of the MSFD classification of predominant habitats although this is not the case. 

In the paper report, Belgium uses the habitat types and EUNIS level 3 classifications and it is not always clear on how to translate this into the MSFD classification. It is also difficult to distinguish shallow and shelf. This classification shows less detail than the MSFD one and does not have a one to one relationship to the ecologically-meaningful habitat types but is commonly used by surrounding MS's. In the paper report, Belgium also provides a separate description of seabed and water column habitat types and seabed and water column’s biological characteristics, where benthic communities and planktons are described. While benthic communities are reported in the reporting sheet under various predominant habitats, plankton is not at all reported in the reporting sheet.  

For each habitat/habitat type reported in the reporting sheet, a limited description has been provided of the habitat distribution (often providing correspondence to the relevant EUNIS classification), extent and condition. For certain habitat types, the information provided is quantitative. Sometimes the same information is reported under different predominant habitat types (e.g. shelf and shallow sand) and it is also mentioned that certain predominant habitats are the same as habitats listed under the Habitats Directive. The correspondence between EUNIS classification, individual habitat types and MSFD predominant habitat types is not clearly presented.  

The main pressure and impacts on the habitat types have been provided. No qualitative judgement has been made on the current status of the habitat types in relation to GES apart from the status of artificial hard substrates, which is described in a lot of details but should actually be rather considered as a description than a judgement on status. The same applies to the assessment of status of the H1170 habitat which is actually the description of the habitat distribution. However, a judgement is made on the trend in status for H1170 (declining) and artificial hard substrate (improving).

Ecosystems
Belgium has not reported at the ecosystem level. ";Overall the initial assessment carried out by Belgium in relation to the biological features is partially adequate. The assessment covers most habitat types and the main relevant species groups. However, judgements on the current status of habitats and species groups are only made in some cases and the main pressures on the features are not well described. There is no justification why certain species groups (e.g. cephalopods) or certain functional groups (e.g. pelagic or demersal fish) have not been included in the assessment. A description of the species listed under the Birds and Habitats Directive is provided.;"Features:
- Covers most habitat types and the main relevant species groups 
- Limited description of pressures
- Judgements are only provided in some cases";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Belgium has set 17 targets each accompanied with an associated indicator to cover the three biodiversity descriptors. The targets set by Belgium cover almost all criteria for D1, 4 and 6 of the Commission Decision. The only criteria not covered are 4.1 (productivity of key species or trophic groups) and 4.2 (proportion of selected species using at the top of the food webs), meaning that the targets cover food webs only partially.

The targets cover seabirds, with specific species mentioned that are included under the scope of the Birds Directive, molluscs, benthic fauna and flora, elasmobranch and mammals. For the last two categories, Belgium has selected one indicator species representative of the group (the Raja clavata ray for elasmobranch and the Phocoena phocoena harbour porpoise for the mammals). Fish are not covered by the Belgian targets for biodiversity. Commercial stocks are covered by the targets for Descriptor 3 but other non-commercial stocks are therefore not covered. For the habitats, Belgium is using the EUNIS 3 classification rather than the MSFD predominant habitat type classification, covering mud, sand, coarse grained sediment and gravel beds. 

Baseline values for environmental targets refer either to OSPAR EcoQO's, a time reference, the WFD. A number of targets are set for the main species groups and habitat types. For a large number, as the baseline is the state in 2012, it is mentioned that the baseline is still to be calculated/determined. On the whole, the targets are SMART and in some cases quite detailed to species level. 

Many targets relate to trends but there is no specification of a threshold value or at least a quantitative trend in relation to the baseline (e.g. decrease by X%).  

Only a limited number of targets refer to pressures and they are focused on disturbances to seafloor habitats from contact with fishing gear and promotion of alternative, environment-friendly fishing gear.";On the whole, the set of targets and indicators defined by Belgium to cover descriptors 1 and 6 are considered as adequate while the targets for descriptor 4 are considered partially adequate. The targets are specific, measurable, realistic and time-bound. In particular, they address the main species groups although only a single species of fish (raja clavata) is covered, and some of the main habitat types. In some ways, the targets appear more detailed than the initial assessment. The targets for descriptors 1 and 6 are ambitious and will aid reaching or maintaining GES if achieved in the timescale given.  In the case of descriptor 4 the targets do not cover the concept of productivity, set a target for large fish and do not address all the main components of the food web. It should also be noted that the set of targets do not address specifically all relevant pressures, which may be a more pragmatic approach. ;"- The targets and indicators defined for biodiversity cover all three Descriptors (1, 4 and 6)
- Most of them are SMART as they include specific threshold values
- They cover the main biodiversity components except non-commercial fish
- They are ambitious and would allow to reach GES if achieved
- Lack of pressure targets";3;Adequate
Belgium;D1;Consistency ;;"Belgium has taken an approach to GES definition whereby different elements which relate to several criteria/indicator are combined to define one condition. The accompanying assessment does not follow this same approach and therefore does not include a judgement on the status of the features reported in relation to their GES definition. It is also difficult to assess whether the set of environmental targets and associate indicators defined for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 collectively address all the main pressures and impacts related to these descriptors as identified by the initial assessment, due to the nature of the targets set. Species related targets do not relate directly back to the pressure. With regard to habitat related targets, only fishing pressure are mentioned.

While the targets are quite specific in addressing population trends and habitat disturbance, given that GES definitions are very broad, it is uncertain whether the targets will be sufficient to achieve GES. ";;;;
Belgium;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Belgium has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor and criteria level. All criteria laid out for Descriptor 10 in the Commission Decision are incorporated, but not the indicators.  The GES definition at descriptor level cites the definition in the Decision. The two criteria, even though the numbering is inverted, reflect closely the criteria set in the Commission Decision. 

The criteria aim to reduce the amount of litter and the impact of marine litter on respectively marine life and habitats (10.1) and on the coastal and marine environment (10.2). Yet, it is unclear how Belgium aims to achieve a reduction in the amount of litter and whether they will address new waste entering the marine environment and/or the existing waste in the marine environment. 

The main features addressed by GES are listed in the reporting sheets, which also refer to the initial assessment as the baseline for threshold values. However, threshold values have not been set in either the paper report or the reporting sheets. A reference is made to OSPAR common language in the paper report.";"The GES definition of Belgium for D10 is assessed as inadequate. The definition of GES at descriptor level is a mere copy or reformulation of the MSFD; at criteria level it reflects closely the 2010 Commission Decision. However, it is not clear whether GES refers to new and/or existing waste and no threshold values have been set.";"- GES definition at descriptor level is mere reproduction of Annex I MSFD
- Definition at criteria level following the Commission Decision
- Unclear whether GES refers to new and/or existing waste
- No threshold value set";1;Inadequate
Belgium;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Belgium has carried out an initial assessment on marine litter – both qualitatively and quantitatively. It refers to the level of pressures on the coast, the water column and seabed, providing figures and trends. In relation to impacts, Belgium describes the impact of litter on marine animals, but not in the water column or on the seabed habitats. There is also no mention to micro-particles.

Belgium reports substantial data from the OSPAR initiatives for beach litter monitoring and the OSPAR EcoQO target on the ingestion of plastic by Fulmars. During 2002-2006, in average 1000 items/ km beach were found.  The main items found on the beach are fishing nets, plastic packaging, fireworks and cigarette butts. Based on a Dutch study from 2003, the target on litter in fulmar stomachs is exceeded. Belgium reports on collected waste in the Fishing for Litter project (until 2011) and Waste-free Ocean (from 2011 onwards). It is indicated that the main sources for marine litter are shipping, fisheries, but also tourism and cargo loss. Although there is no assessment of the habitats impacted, these are listed in the reporting sheets. 

There is no judgement on the level of pressure and impacts per reference to the definition of GES, however, the impact of litter on marine animals is considered to exceed the OSPAR target levels.";The initial assessment of Belgium for marine litter is assessed as adequate. Even if the impact of marine litter on the different habitats has not been assessed, it is considered that the information available is well-presented and covers all the relevant pressures. ;"- Adequate qualitative and quantitative assessment
- All relevant sources covered
- Reference to OSPAR studies
- Lack of assessment of impacts";3;Adequate
Belgium;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Belgium reported four targets, each associated with one indicator. Targets are identified in accordance to the indicators of the criteria in the Decision. 

A consistent and measurable set of targets is presented, addressing, the quantities of stranded litter, quantities of litter collected at sea and the number of visible litter items on coastlines. The targets are based on OSPAR initiatives, namely the beach litter monitoring programme, OSPAR recommendation 2010/19 (collection of beach litter at sea)) and the EcoQO target on the ingestion of plastic by Fulmars. 

The baseline has been identified by means of data from the IA and OSPAR. Threshold values have not been set, except for the already established Fulmar target. Without a quantitative target, it is difficult to judge on the level of ambition. In addition, targets have not been identified to address pressures (sources) of marine litter, despite the statement on the reduction of the amount of litter in the GES definition. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Belgium for D10 is assessed as partially adequate. The targets are consistent and measurable. However no thresholds are provided and therefore it is difficult to assess the level of ambition. There are also no targets addressing pressures but just impacts.;"- Potentially measurable targets
- Lack of threshold values but baseline defined
- Targets only address impacts and not pressures";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D10;Consistency ;;"Consistent use and reference is made to OSPAR methodologies and data, in the GES definition, the IA and the targets. The IA and targets consistently focus on beach litter, litter collected at sea and plastics ingested by Fulmars, however, other aspects of the marine and coastal environment are not covered. 

The GES definition aims to reduce the amount of litter such that it does not cause damage/harm to marine life and habitats, and the marine and coastal environment. There are no targets that can reduce the amount of litter, except for the implicit clean-up of existing waste linked to beach litter monitoring and collection litter at sea. The main sources of marine litter are reported in the initial assessment, but not further addressed in the GES definition nor in the set of targets.";;;;
Belgium;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Belgium has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor and criteria level. The GES definition at descriptor level is cited from the Directive. The criteria are different than those included in the Decision. In the reporting sheets, criterion 11.2 is not included and instead criterion 11.1 is duplicated.

Since the GES definitions for both criteria level lump impulsive and continuous sound together, it is unclear what the distinction is between both criteria. The criteria aim to achieve levels of sound that do not adversely impact respectively marine organisms (criterion 11.1) and marine ecosystems (criterion 11.2). Hereby, it is assumed that sound budgets refer to continuous, ambient sound rather than to impulsive sounds. Argumentation is not given on why the proposed set of criteria is considered better than the criteria proposed in the Decision. 

OSPAR is mentioned, but without clear reference to relevant documents such as e.g. the background document on noise or the JAMP assessment.";The GES definition of Belgium for D11 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition of GES at descriptor level is based on the definition of Annex I MSFD and it is further specified through the definition at the criteria level. However, there is no explanation to why different criteria have been used and the distinction between impulsive sound and continuous sound is missing. ;"- GES definition at descriptor level is based on Annex I MSFD
- GES also defined at criteria level but different criteria used
- No justification for not using the Commission Decision criteria
- No distinction between impulsive and continuous sound";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);Data of underwater noise in the Belgian marine waters and its possible impact on underwater species are limited at present. A distinction is not made between impulsive and continuous sound. Monitoring and further scientific studies in the scope of the Marine Strategy therefore are necessary. Renewable energy and shipping are identified as the largest contributors to the noise pressure. Yet, few details on the magnitude of the pressures are reported. A distinction is not made between the impulsive and continuous sound and there is not any reference to OSPAR.;The initial assessment of Belgium for underwater noise is assessed as inadequate. There is currently very little information on underwater noise in Belgium, basically only the sources of noise are listed.;"- Limited data on underwater noise in Belgian waters
- Some sources identified as main pressures but limited information provided
- No distinction made of impulsive and continuous sounds
- No reference to OSPAR";1;Inadequate
Belgium;D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Belgium reports two targets on underwater sound, each associated with one indicator. Target 48 aims to limit the anthropogenic impulsive sound of individual projects. The target is measurable and the target definition includes a threshold value to be reached at 750m from the source. Some measuring methods are reported. Target 48 reveals a pragmatic approach since it is relevant to assess and limit the impact of anthropogenic impulsive sound. Yet, it is unclear how the threshold value for noise pressure has been defined. In addition, it is unclear whether target 48 can also be used to limit impulsive sound sources on a larger, regional scale. A tool for large-scale marine management of underwater noise is not presented. Target 49 could be measurable, when systematic monitoring system becomes operational. The target aims to keep the ambient sound level below the current sound level.

No targets have been identified to address the sources of underwater sound. With the current set of targets, it is questionable whether GES will be achieved. ";The set of targets defined by Belgium for underwater noise is assessed as partially adequate. Although target 48 is measurable, target 49 can only be measurable if a systematic monitoring system is implemented. It is not clear if GES will be achieved with the current set of targets.;"- SMART targets since they integrate threshold values
- Second target can be measured only if systematic monitoring is implemented
- No target on sources of underwater noise";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D11;Consistency ;;In general, the reporting on underwater sound is limited for GES, IA and targets. The GES definition is consistent with the set of targets, and in correspondence with the Decision, but it is specific enough. The targets and the GES definition are not addressing the pressures of underwater noise. The main pressures are reported in the IA but are described in limited detail. It is doubtful whether GES can be achieved. Substantial data and knowledge gaps are reported.;;;;
Belgium;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Belgium set GES for Descriptor 2 only at descriptor level and for one criterion out of two, in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. At descriptor level, the definition is very close to the one of the Directive although the wording is slightly different. Both wordings are considered as equivalent. 

Criterion 2.2 is not mentioned in the GES definition and there is no justification for this.

Finally, there is a definition at the level of criterion 2.1 which also reflects the indicator 2.1.1. It sets an objective of no ‘significant’ increase in the ‘relative’ abundance of NIS. There are no further details as to what is a ‘significant’ increase’, nor what is the ‘relative’ abundance. Baseline is put down with an initial assessment in 2012. Finally, this GES definition excludes species for which there are taxonomic disputes and for which the changes of permanent introduction, including reproduction are negligible are not taken into consideration";The definition of GES for D2 is assessed as partially adequate. GES is defined only at descriptor level and for one criterion out of two. Criterion 2.2 is not covered The definition is not sufficiently precise to assess if GES is reached or not. The baseline is rightly set at the current status. However, Belgium adds some exceptions without clear justification and specification. The minimum requirements are not fully reflected. Rather than ‘no new introduction’, the GES definition focuses on no increase in relative abundance and lack of impacts. ;"- GES only at descriptor level and for one criterion
'- Definition at descriptor level is very close to the Annex I definition
'- At the level of criterion 2.1, the definition remains general & some species are excluded
- Baseline is the current status";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Belgium reported on 23 species in the reporting sheets. The Belgium list counts more species than the list prepared under the project ‘Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories for Europe’ (DAISIE). However, it is considered as incomplete as about one hundred non-indigenous species have been identified in the Belgian coastal areas that were introduced – either intentionally or accidentally – through human activities. 

The ratio between invasive and native species is not indicated and no assessment of the level of pressure on the environment is provided, although some information is presented on abundance, with an increasing trend of the number of newly recognised introductions, with a particularly remarkable rise after 1975, mainly as a result of more studies. Density (ind/m3) provided for sea walnut, American jacknife. The Belgium report also mentions that four NIS currently have a dominant presence in the marine coastal habitats (both hard and soft substrates): the American jackknife, the Japanese oyster, the New Zealand barnacle and the common slipper shell.";The assessment is considered to be partially adequate. Not all NIS present in Belgian waters are reported upon. The assessment is carried out for several parameters (abundance, spatial distribution, relation to vectors and pathways), and this is done in an adequate way. The assessment covers all relevant geographical areas. However, some information is still missing like ratios between indigenous and non-indigenous species, levels of pressure on the environment, risk areas, and level of impacts on features. Judgements on level and impact of the pressure and plans to fill knowledge gaps are also missing.;"- Adequate assessment of abundance, spatial distribution, vectors and pathways
- Level of pressure and impacts on features are not provided
- No judgement of pressure or trend is provided
- No plans to fill data/knowledge gaps";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Belgium has defined one target and one associated indicator to cover Descriptor 2. The target relates only to the introduction of new NIS; while GES definition also relates to no significant increase in relative abundance NIS in relation to 2012 baseline. Therefore, GES and the environmental target are not consistent. The target relates only to macro-fauna and flora. The Belgian paper report mentions that the extension of the target to all ecosystem components will be considered for the next cycles without further clarification.

In general, the target is specific, time-bound (July 2020 ), but it appears very difficult to measure and not realistic as it would be difficult to measure all NIS in an area, because the chance to find a newly introduced, hardly spread species in the course of a survey is very limited. It is also not realistic because it is not deemed possible to avoid (stop) all new introductions.

In addition, the target is not sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact, or controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved, as it is not explicit enough. In particular, it does not cover all the main sources of new introductions.

Belgium also introduces specific limitations. The target applies only to macro-fauna and flora (above 1 mm) and does not cover species for which there are taxonomic disputes and for which the changes of permanent introduction, including reproduction are negligible.";The target is assessed as inadequate as it is not realistic and measurable and does not cover all the main sources. The target only relates to new introductions and there is no target on preventing the further expansion of existing NIS. Besides, there is no associated indicator. Finally, Belgium has excluded certain species from the target based on size, uncertainty in knowledge and level of pressure.;"- Only one target which relates to new introduction but not preventing the further spreading of existing NIS
- The target is not SMART
- It does not cover all the main sources of introduction
- No associated indicator
- Certain species excluded as for GES";1;Inadequate
Belgium;D2;Consistency ;;"While the assessment has identified particular species and vectors/pathways, the definition of GES and environmental targets remain very general. 

Besides, as mentioned above, the target relates only to the introduction of new NIS and not existing NIS; while GES definition also relates to no significant increase in relative abundance NIS in relation to 2012 baseline. Therefore, GES and the environmental target are not consistent.

The set of targets is not considered as sufficient to achieve GES, which is itself defined in a vague way. The targets relate directly to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts but without any specification. In particular, no threshold has been set.";;;;
Belgium;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Belgium has defined GES for Descriptor 3 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. Criteria 3.1 and 3.2 have been used in the Belgian GES definition while criterion 3.3 has not been applied. For criterion 3.1 there are four, and for criterion 3.2 three, situations to determine whether GES is achieved which are based on the data available for the stock. Reference points such as Fmsy and SSBmsy will rely on ICES advice.

For criteria 3.1 the first two situations as described for the Belgian GES definition apply the Commission Decision primary indicator 3.1.1 fishing mortality (F). The Commission Decision however states that fishing mortality should be at or below Fmsy for all stocks while the Belgian GES allows for exploitation at Fpa under the conditions of situation 2, this is not consistent with the Commission Decision and the outcomes of the working groups. 

Situation 3 of criterion 3.1 has used the secondary indicator as provided by the commission decision and states that the ratio is consistent with a sustainable exploitation based on a proxy reference point. It is however not indicated what is meant with sustainable whether the reference point will be a proxy of MSY which would be in line with the commission decision or whether it means that the indicator does not have a degradation gradient which is in line with the MSFD Task Group 3 Report (March 2010). 

In the case of situation 4 the trends of survey CPUE will be evaluated, however no reference point or trend that could be used to assess GES is specified. 

For criteria 3.2 situation 1 and 2 use the primary indicator 3.2.1 from the Commission Decision spawning stock biomass (SSB). In those situations where the SSBmsy is known GES is achieved when SSB is at SSBmsy which is in line with the Commission decision. During the working group meetings it has however been decided that in order to achieve GES the limit for SSB can also be set at SSBpa which Belgium applies in situation 2 where SSBmsy is not known. For situation 3 instead of using the secondary indicator 3.2.2 biomass indices instead Belgium will rely on trends of survey abundances. It is however difficult to discern whether proxy reference points for this indicator will be set and if yes whether they will be set at MSY or PA.";The GES definition of Belgium for descriptor 3 is assessed as partially adequate. Not all of the different situations defined for criterion 3.1 are in accordance with the requirements of the Commission Decision or the outcomes of the working group meetings that require that all stocks are exploited at or below Fmsy. Not all the limit reference points are clearly defined. For Criterion 3.3 while it is acknowledged in the Commission Decision that this criterion requires additional work to become operational it should still be applied in the national GES definitions.;"- GES states that all stocks should be within safe biological limits

- Criterion 3.3 is not applied";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Belgian initial assessment has reported on the impacts on fish stocks and ecosystem components and provided some information on the fishing fleet and level of fishing activity. The information is mainly of a qualitative nature and lacks details such as fleet sizes amount of seabed disturbed and number of functional groups affected by fisheries. 

In the reporting sheets Belgium does provide information regarding the status of Fish stocks in Belgium waters. 5 out of 26 fish stocks were assessed to meet the EcoQO criteria for spawning stock biomass, 8 fish stocks were outside safe biological limits and for 11 fish stocks no reference points could be set. No trends for the pressure from fisheries or for fish stocks as a group were provided. ";The initial assessment of Belgium for the pressure of fisheries is assessed as partially adequate. In the reporting sheets an overview for the amount of stocks within safe biological limits is provided.  For most aspects however the assessment lacks adequate quantitative information and remains very general.;"- Provides an overview for the amount of stocks with a SSB that are within and outside safe biological limits
- Most of the assessment general and insufficiently quantified  including that for fleets";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Belgium has defined seven targets and seven associated indicators to address Descriptor 3. The targets are specified towards achieving the GES defined by Belgium and should be achieved by 2020. The targets are not sufficiently ambitious to achieve the objectives of the MSFD. 

For target 23, the fishing mortality for all stocks should be at or below Fmsy not Fpa by 2020. For target 24 the target should be for all stocks to be at or above SSBpa and not only a movement into a positive direction. Target 26 is not SMART as it is not clear what type of revision will take place after six years or what the outcome of the discussion are supposed to be. Target 24 is in conflict with targets 20 and 22, as it states that stocks outside of safe biological limits should show a positive trend while targets 20 and 22 require that all stocks are within safe biological limits. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Belgium for descriptor 3 is assessed as inadequate. The targets are not consistent as a set. In particular target 24 is not sufficiently ambitious to achieve the objectives of the MSFD which requires that all stocks are within safe biological limits.

- Targets are not always consistent as a set (targets are set in relation to the GES definition)
- Not all targets are SMART";1;Inadequate
Belgium;D3;Consistency ;;The GES addresses the issues identified in the initial assessment and specifically the lack of quantified stock assessments which are needed for the determination of reference points such as Fmsy and Bpa. Belgium relies on ICES estimates of MSY and PA points. The targets generally match with the GES definition but target 24 is in conflict with the other targets as well as the objectives of the MSFD that all stocks are at least at SSBpa by 2020. With the exception of target 24 the targets are generally sufficient to achieve GES although they are state targets not pressure targets. ;;;;
Belgium;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Belgium has set GES for Descriptor 4 at descriptor and criteria level in both the paper report (Definition of GES and environmental targets for Belgian marine waters) and the reporting sheet. GES is not set at indicator level. The definition at descriptor level reproduces verbatim the definition of Annex I of the MSFD. The lack of indicator detail means that only relatively general descriptions apply.

According to the reporting sheet, all birds, fish, NIS and mammals are covered. However the definitions are very general. The baseline is limited to the 2012 Initial Assessment.

In relation to other Member States the spatial scale of Belgium waters is relatively limited and therefore it is considered as acceptable that GES apply to the whole marine waters, as long as the habitat types (e.g. water column, sea bed, etc.) within are treated separately where necessary.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 4 is assessed as partially adequate. Reference is made to the structure of the food web but details are lacking/ insufficient. This may partially be due to Belgium’s approach of assessing D1, D4 & D6 together.

Belgium;D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Adequate; 3, but D4 is assessed as Partially adequate):

Belgium has set 17 targets each accompanied with an associated indicator to cover the three biodiversity descriptors. The targets set by Belgium cover almost all criteria for D1, 4 and 6 of the Commission Decision. The only criteria not covered are 4.1 (productivity of key species or trophic groups) and 4.2 (proportion of selected species using at the top of the food webs), meaning that the targets cover food webs only partially.

The targets cover seabirds, with specific species mentioned that are included under the scope of the Birds Directive, molluscs, benthic fauna and flora, elasmobranch and mammals. For the last two categories, Belgium has selected one indicator species representative of the group (the Raja clavata ray for elasmobranch and the Phocoena phocoena harbour porpoise for the mammals). Fish are not covered by the Belgian targets for biodiversity. Commercial stocks are covered by the targets for Descriptor 3 but other non-commercial stocks are therefore not covered. For the habitats, Belgium is using the EUNIS 3 classification rather than the MSFD predominant habitat type classification, covering mud, sand, coarse grained sediment and gravel beds. 

Baseline values for environmental targets refer either to OSPAR EcoQO's, a time reference, the WFD. A number of targets are set for the main species groups and habitat types. For a large number, as the baseline is the state in 2012, it is mentioned that the baseline is still to be calculated/determined. On the whole, the targets are SMART and in some cases quite detailed to species level. 

Many targets relate to trends but there is no specification of a threshold value or at least a quantitative trend in relation to the baseline (e.g. decrease by X%).  

Only a limited number of targets refer to pressures and they are focused on disturbances to seafloor habitats from contact with fishing gear and promotion of alternative, environment-friendly fishing gear.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Adequate; 3):

On the whole, the set of targets and indicators defined by Belgium to cover descriptors 1 and 6 are considered as adequate while the targets for descriptor 4 are considered partially adequate. The targets are specific, measurable, realistic and time-bound. In particular, they address the main species groups although only a single species of fish (raja clavata) is covered, and some of the main habitat types. In some ways, the targets appear more detailed than the initial assessment. The targets for descriptors 1 and 6 are ambitious and will aid reaching or maintaining GES if achieved in the timescale given.  In the case of descriptor 4 the targets do not cover the concept of productivity, set a target for large fish and do not address all the main components of the food web. It should also be noted that the set of targets do not address specifically all relevant pressures, which may be a more pragmatic approach. ";"- Most of them are SMART as they include specific threshold values

Belgium;D4;Consistency ;;"Belgium has taken an approach to GES definition whereby different elements which relate to several criteria/indicator are combined to define one condition. The accompanying assessment does not follow this same approach and therefore does not include a judgement on the status of the features reported in relation to their GES definition. It is also difficult to assess whether the set of environmental targets and associate indicators defined for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 collectively address all the main pressures and impacts related to these descriptors as identified by the initial assessment, due to the nature of the targets set. Species related targets do not relate directly back to the pressure. With regard to habitat related targets, only fishing pressure are mentioned.

While the targets are quite specific in addressing population trends and habitat disturbance, given that GES definitions are very broad, it is uncertain whether the targets will be sufficient to achieve GES. ";;;;
Belgium;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Belgium has defined GES for Descriptor 5 only at descriptor level. The definition in the paper report is the same as in the reporting sheet but it includes in addition the definition of Annex I of the MSFD. Even though it is only defined at descriptor level, two conditions are set in order to achieve GES: WFD good ecological status is achieved and thresholds established under the OSPAR Common Procedure are complied with. 

No further explanation of those conditions is provided and thus one can assume that for WFD purposes, D5 GES is defined in terms of phytoplankton and phytobenthos community status, perhaps with supporting physico-chemical quality elements, and for the OSPAR Common Procedure, marine waters are defined as being eutrophication non-problematic areas, for which only preliminary information is required under the screening procedure (e.g. excluding organic loads and nutrient concentrations in offshore waters). No attempt is made to match the monitoring requirements of these conditions to those of the criteria provided in the Commission Decision, and thus it is not known whether, for example, macrophytobenthos or phytoplankton community status is a suitable indicator of trophic status, or whether some form of disaggregation of WFD monitoring data should be provided for MSFD status assessments. 

The MSFD GES D5 definition is matched to WFD GES thresholds – as already mentioned above the proposed definition of GES is a combination of the national WFD approach and the international OSPAR Common Procedure. However, a more detailed description of national monitoring requirements and status assessments under the WFD and the OSPAR Common Procedure is required, matching the criteria used to those in the Commission Decision. ";The GES definition of Belgium for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition of GES is not a copy or reformulation of the MSFD, but does not meet the minimum requirements (it is not clear whether indirect effect criteria are considered and included either under OSPAR or WFD monitoring programmes). GES is the same as WFD normative definitions of good ecological status, but specific thresholds are presented under Article 10, not 9 as they should be. Based on the above, it would be difficult to determine when GES had been achieved.;"- GES is defined only at descriptor level but it is not a copy of the MSFD

Belgium;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The assessment covers all relevant nutrients – nitrogen and phosphorus – in terms of loads, but does not appear to cover organic loads, although a decreasing trend of the input of organic matter through riverine input (Scheldt) in the coastal waters is referred to. Decreasing trends for nutrient loads are reported, but not as percentage decreases, which is the metric required for a ‘referenced’ assessment. Very little information appears to be provided on nutrient concentrations or chlorophyll/Phaeocystis levels; rather, a repeat of threshold levels is given. In addition, no information is given on the concentrations of organic matter.

No information is provided on the extent of coverage of offshore waters. Under the WFD it is assumed that all coastal water bodies are included, but no information on the density of coverage is provided. Agriculture, forestry and industry are mentioned as the main causes of eutrophication in the reporting sheets.

No information is provided on macrophytobenthos (although impacts on shallow mud and sand features are referred to in the reporting sheets), water transparency or dissolved oxygen status, yet coastal waters are defined as an OSPAR eutrophication problematic area, and as being of only moderate status under the WFD, so information must be available.

Belgium;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Belgium has defined three targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 5, which are the same in the reporting sheet and the paper report. 

The three targets for chlorophyll, Phaeocystis cell density and nutrient levels cover Commission criteria 5.1 (nutrient levels) and 5.2 (direct effects), but exclude indirect effects (criterion 5.3). Nutrient ratios appear to be regarded as not appropriate and there are no baseline/threshold conditions for water transparency. Phaeocystis enumeration could be regarded as a threshold for species shifts in floristic composition, but there are no baselines/thresholds for macrophytobenthos (criteria 5.2.3 and 5.3.1). No justification is provided for not including all criteria (5.1, 5.2 and 5.3) or indicators (5.1.1, 5.1.2, etc.).

The targets are all measureable and sufficiently specific, allowing progress towards the targets to be assessed. However, no timescale is provided for achieving the targets and there is not sufficient information in the initial assessment to provide an educated insight as to whether they are achievable and realistic by 2020.

The targets addressed all relevant impacts. However, they make no reference to macrophytobenthos and fail to tackle individual pressures. The targets may not be ambitious enough to achieve GES by 2020. Finally, the set of targets is consistent and there are no conflicting targets.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Belgium for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. They are relatively ambitious and targeted to reduced levels of impact in order to achieve GES but it is not clear if that will happen by 2020.

Impacts on dissolved oxygen levels are not included as an impact in the initial assessment.

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 does not cover all impacts related to Descriptor 5 identified in the initial assessment. Impacts on shallow sand and mud communities are mentioned in the initial assessment but the targets make no reference to macrophytobenthos.

The environmental targets established by Belgium should lead to a reduction in the identified impacts, since the targets appear to provide a boundary for GES (which is currently still not achieved). The reduction of impacts will require a reduction in pressures. However, the targets and indicators tackle a limited number of impacts and it is not specified what other impacts would need to be considered to achieve full compliance with either WFD or OSPAR objectives, the achievement of which is required for the GES.";;;;
Belgium;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Similarly to D1 and 4, GES for Descriptor 6 is set at descriptor and criteria level, and not at indicator level. The definition at descriptor level reproduces verbatim the definition of Annex I of the MSFD. The lack of indicator detail means that only relatively general descriptions apply.

The baseline reference for D6 and criterion 6.1 is limited to the initial assessment and there is no threshold value for criterion 6.1. The definition for criterion 6.1 is rather vague and unspecific. The references for criterion 6.2 are the Habitats and Birds Directives, the WFD and OSPAR in terms of 'attaining' the good conditions they define, which is slightly more specific and measurable.
 
The definitions/establishment of baseline conditions based on these agreements are appropriate and relevant for GES definition but they could be clearer, i.e. how are they being applied in the context of Belgian waters.

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

The analysis and assessment on the level of pressure, and impact from, physical loss in the light of available knowledge to assess this topic is only partial.

The Belgium report addresses only the impact from port infrastructure and wind farms, and quantitative analysis is very limited and restricted to these two fields. Some information is provided on the geographical area for physical loss but only for the port infrastructure and, in very general terms, the wind farm activity. The report identifies as the main causes of physical destruction of the seabed, the construction of the port of Zeebrugge in the twentieth century, the recent seaward expansion of the port of Ostend and the widening/deepening of existing channels. More recently the construction of offshore wind farms has resulted in physical loss as a result of erosion protection. The current status of physical loss on the environment is not given or the current level of impact or trend, other than by reference to existing directives. The Birds and Habitats Directives, the WFD and the EIA Directive are referred to and a threshold value is given for the level of loss but without further explanation, making the assessment unclear.

With regard to physical damage, a cumulative assessment has been carried out for dredging and dumping activities, but no overall cumulative assessment which would include fisheries activities, extraction activities. For these activities only a description was provided with a limited amount of quantitative data. The main cause of physical damage is identified as the significant increase of the number and scope of hydrographical interventions (sand extraction for coastal defence and commercial purposes, dredging navigation channels, construction of wind farms, laying of cables) during the second half of the 20th century. Bottom trawling also results in physical damage of the seabed. Information is provided on the location and extent of the various pressures. A partial assessment has been carried out for level and impacts of physical damage. Fisheries, aggregate extraction and dredging are discussed with some additional information on scale and geographic location, there is no justification for why only these 3 are discussed. A very general statement is provided on the main causes for physical damage. The MS has made no judgement on the current level of pressure or trend in the pressure, and only partially makes a judgement of the impact on features. Status assessment is based on the Bird and Habitat Directive, WFD and EIA's. Three thresholds are given for the level of damage which is dominated by fishing activities. 

The impact of physical loss and damage is addressed with reference to the relevant directives (as listed above) and a series of quantitative threshold values. The majority of the indices used for quantifying impacts are acceptable and well-known approaches (with the exception of BPc , more explanatory details are required), however, more detail is required to put into context their proposed levels, e.g. 'min. BEQI  of 0.6', but without indication of the range. It is unclear whether the analysis covers all types of physical loss/damage in the area.

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
The description of habitats in the reporting sheet is fragmented. In relation to the sea bed there is a lack of input for the littoral (intertidal zone) but some input is provided for shallow (i.e. identification of four subtidal communities which are each linked to a specific habitat) and shelf (i.e. gravel beds) habitat types. In relation to the water column, only a general description is provided with almost no input on coastal or shelf waters and there is no justification provided for why this is the case. Geographical descriptions are basic. In addition to reporting on several predominant habitat types (Shallow sublittoral sand, Shallow sublittoral mud, Shelf sublittoral coarse sediment, Shelf sublittoral mixed sediment, coastal and shelf) marine water Belgium has also reported on four additional habitats: H1110 and H1170 from the Habitats Directive and peatzones and artificial hard substrates, which are listed by Belgium as part of the MSFD classification of predominant habitats although this is not the case. 

In the paper report, Belgium uses the habitat types and EUNIS level 3 classifications and it is not always clear on how to translate this into the MSFD classification. It is also difficult to distinguish shallow and shelf. This classification shows less detail than the MSFD one and does not have a one to one relationship to the ecologically-meaningful habitat types but is commonly used by surrounding MS's. In the paper report, Belgium also provides a separate description of seabed and water column habitat types and seabed and water column’s biological characteristics, where benthic communities and planktons are described. While benthic communities are reported in the reporting sheet under various predominant habitats, plankton is not at all reported in the reporting sheet.  

For each habitat/habitat type reported in the reporting sheet, a limited description has been provided of the habitat distribution (often providing correspondence to the relevant EUNIS classification), extent and condition. For certain habitat types, the information provided is quantitative. Sometimes the same information is reported under different predominant habitat types (e.g. shelf and shallow sand) and it is also mentioned that certain predominant habitats are the same as habitats listed under the Habitats Directive. The correspondence between EUNIS classification, individual habitat types and MSFD predominant habitat types is not clearly presented.  

The main pressure and impacts on the habitat types have been provided. No qualitative judgement has been made on the current status of the habitat types in relation to GES apart from the status of artificial hard substrates, which is described in a lot of details but should actually be rather considered as a description than a judgement on status. The same applies to the assessment of status of the H1170 habitat which is actually the description of the habitat distribution. However, a judgement is made on the trend in status for H1170 (declining) and artificial hard substrate (improving). ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment :

Belgium;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"In the paper report, Belgium has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor level but with the addition two conditions to achieve GES, which incorporate the two criteria laid out for Descriptor 7 in the Commission Decision. In the reporting sheet, Belgium reports these two conditions as 7.1 and 7.2 but they actually do not match the Decision’s criteria. 

Indeed, 7.2 in the reporting sheet (or the second condition in the paper report) relates to flow patterns resulting from human activities. The addition of this condition should be assessed in conjunction with the assessment made by Belgium of morphological changes in its IA paper report, which looks mainly at changed erosion-sedimentation patterns due to disturbance of the hydrodynamics. However, the IA does not specify how these changes impact ecosystem components and therefore how including this condition in the GES definition will help the achievement of the overall GES objective to not adversely affect marine ecosystems. More explanation would be needed as to why this specific aspects has been addressed in the initial assessment (and therefore is addressed in the GES definition) and not others (e.g. better control of sand extraction). Also, this condition lacks information about spatial and temporal scale.

In the reporting sheets the initial assessment carried out during 2012 is referred to as the baseline for the measurement of progress towards GES. The features and pressures addressed by GES are also listed. However, no threshold value is provided and no link is made to WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters or to other existing regulatory regimes to be complied with (e.g. EIA, SEA, Habitats and Birds Directives). No specific detail is given about the interpretation of the main parameters (“significant”, “long term”, “scale”, “balanced”).";"The GES definition of Belgium for D7 is assessed as partially adequate. GES has been defined; it is not a simple reformulation of the MSFD. However, taking into account the lack of specific information it is considered that the definition of GES is actually only at descriptor level and not really at criteria level. The addition of the second condition/criterion on flow patterns would require more specification to be considered a good practice. On the other hand, the definition is set only at a very general level. The use of the initial assessment as the baseline for measurement of progress towards GES would be in line with the Commission approach if Belgium had made a judgement on the current status in relation to hydrographical conditions (i.e. current status is acceptable). Without such judgement, it cannot be assessed whether the use of current status as a baseline is adequate or not. ";"- GES is defined at a general level

Belgium;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"An initial assessment of the level of pressure of permanent hydrographical alterations has been carried out by Belgium, which refers to the difficulty in distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic causes and linking them to the corresponding impacts, as well as to the need to set quantified criteria in the future. There is not, however, a clear plan to address the gaps identified. 

The main water column and seabed habitats affected are listed, along with the main causes of the permanent hydrographical alterations: land claim defence, sand and gravel mining and dredging. In addition, a few specific projects are mentioned such as the Zeebrugge port expansion and the deepening of the sea lanes towards the ports of Ostend, Zeebrugge and the Scheldt estuary. However, there is no mention to the proportion of the environment and habitats affected. A judgement on the current level and impacts of the pressure has not been made. Belgium refers to the assessment made under the Birds and Habitats Directive and in Environmental Impact Assessments but does not report any results from these assessments for the purpose of the Article 8 assessment. The assessment is merely qualitative. 

In the reporting sheet, there is no specific mention of the issue of erosion and sedimentation.

Belgium;D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Belgium has defined three targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 7. The targets are the same both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report; the associated indicators are only mentioned in the reporting sheets. All three targets are considered to be specific, measurable, achievable and realistic.

The targets are sufficiently targeted to the anthropogenic pressures addressed by Descriptor D7 and they take into account the cumulative impacts addressed by Descriptors D1, D4 and D6. In the reporting sheets, threshold values are specified along with baselines to monitor progress. The timescale for achievement of all targets is the generic timescale of December 2020. It is considered that these targets can allow maintaining the changes in limited ranges (space and time).

All targets relate to limitation of impacts and consistently address complementary ways of limiting impacts. There are direct references to EU framework (EIA, SEA, and Habitats Directives) and target 31 is the recommended “operational” target defined by OSPAR, which means that there should be a high level of coherence with neighbouring countries using the same target. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Belgium for D7 is assessed as adequate. The targets are specific and well-focused to limitation of pressures/impacts/changes.

Belgium;D7;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressure and its impacts is consistent with the MS definition of GES, including the assessment of erosion and sedimentation only provided for in the paper report.

In its Article 8 assessment, Belgium reports threshold values for GES that it does not report under Article 9. For Commission criterion 7.1, the threshold value reported relates to bottom stress on a 14 days spring tide/neap tide cycle. For Commission criterion 7.2, the threshold value used is compliance with the existing regulatory regime (e.g. EIA, SEA, Habitats and Birds Directives) and regulatory assessments to avoid impact. Belgium has used these standards for the setting of environmental targets rather than for the definition of GES and therefore is not consistent with the information reported under Article 8. 

The set of environmental targets addresses all the pressures identified in the initial assessment and it is considered that they can lead to a reduction of the relevant pressures and impacts. However, these targets will not be sufficient to achieve or maintain GES in relation to Descriptor 7 since it is not clear what “consideration” entails and that “considering” the impacts outside the recommended range for shear stress and distance will actually lead to prohibiting activities with such impacts. ";;;;
Belgium;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Belgium has set GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor and criteria levels in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. 

The definition at descriptor level is a simple copy of the Directive. However, the definitions of the two criteria of the Commission Decision on concentration and effects of contaminants are specified further with the introduction of relevant risk-based standards. For concentrations, Belgium refers to the WFD EQS for measurements in water and supplements these with OSPAR Environmental Assessment Criteria (EAC) for sediment and biota measurements. Belgium does not explain which of these two approaches will be used for the three substances (Hg, HCB, HCBD) for which an EQS has been defined for measurements in biota and does not provide a hierarchy between the two approaches. 

For the effects of contaminants, Belgium refers to “selected biological process and taxonomic groups” and to the “relevant” OSPAR EcoQOs, but does not specify further what these are. However, it can be inferred that relevant OSPAR EcoQOs refer to the impact of oil on guillemots and of TBT on dog whelks and other sea snails. 

The accompanying text in the paper report provides a definition of what is meant by contaminants and pollution effects, in lines with WFD, OSPAR and HELCOM definitions, but it does not specify further which contaminants are addressed by the GES definition. Without further specification of the substances concerned, the Belgian definition as it is entails that GES is achieved when all contaminants, for which EQS and/or EAC have been developed, have concentrations within these limits. ";The Belgian approach is considered partially adequate. GES is defined at criteria level and refers to the relevant EU and RSC standards. It covers almost all indicators specified in the Commission Decision. Acute pollution events are partly covered through the EcoQO on oiled guillemots but only from an impact point of view. The occurrence, origin and extent of acute pollution episodes (indicator 8.2.2) are not covered by the Belgian definition of GES. The Belgian approach meets the minimum requirements but lacks ambition as it does not specify additional substances or pollution effects to be monitored than those required by WFD and OSPAR. Finally, it should be noted that while OSPAR’s EAC are risk-based (similarly to the EU EQS) and more tailored to marine water assessments than the EQS, the EU requires (also in the new proposal on hazardous substances) that the standards used by the Member States provide an equivalent protection to that provided by the EQSD. ;"- GES defined at criteria level but does not cover criterion 8.2 fully as it does not fully cover acute pollution events
- Use of EQS and EAC but lack of specification on the hierarchy between the two approaches

Belgium;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
The assessment carried out by Belgium of synthetic and non-synthetic substances in the reporting sheet is relatively detailed. Belgium details the various sources of land-based and sea-based contamination. It does not quantify the input loads from land-based sources. No information is provided on input from air-based sources. The justification for this is quite limited as Belgium only states that the main source of contamination is from rivers (and in particular the Scheldt river responsible for 80 to 99% of input of synthetic substances and heavy metals). 

In the reporting sheet, some qualitative trends are provided (e.g. decreasing trend for lindane) but only for a limited number of substances. In the paper report, graphs have been included that show the trends for five substances (Cd, Pb, Hg, lindane and PCBs) from 1990 to 2010. Qualitative trends are also provided with regard to the level of contamination in functional groups, on the basis of OSPAR and WFD monitoring programmes but the assessment remains limited.

No description is provided of the impacts of contamination from hazardous substances (synthetic and non-synthetic) on ecosystem components. No information is provided on gaps in the assessment and plans to address these. 

Belgium makes a quantitative judgement of the current situation in the Belgian marine waters with regard to chemical pollution, in particular looking at the following substances: Pb, Cu, Cd, Zn, Hg, Lindane, PBDEs, DDT, HCB, PAHs, PCBs and TBT. This is done in accordance with the requirements of the WFD and following both WFD and OSPAR’s monitoring approaches. Belgium does not make an aggregated judgement on the level of contamination in relation to GES in general. In the paper report however, it provides tables indicating the status in 2010 of the concentrations in sediment of 27 substances against the OSPAR’s evaluation criteria (i.e. below or above background concentrations). In terms of conclusion, Belgium states first that for a large number of substances, the concentrations in water are below the threshold values and specifies that for a number of substances (in particular TBT, PAHs and PBDEs), the threshold values in water are systematically exceeded. 

Radionuclides
An assessment of contamination by radionuclides has been carried out, mentioning the relevant sources of contamination and referring to OSPAR and WFD assessment frameworks. In the paper report, a number of tables are provided with the kind of radioactive elements monitored and the measured values in various matrices. It is not clear which year these measurements were made. No assessment is made of impacts from contamination by radionuclides on functional groups or seabed habitats. In terms of judgement, there is an inconsistency between the paper report, which indicates that radioactivity is not a problem in the Belgian marine waters, and the reporting sheet, which indicates that WFD and OSPAR targets are not met for certain substances. 

Acute pollution events
Belgium provides a short description of the main sources of acute pollution and quantitative trends in the number of oil discharges and oil spills. It refers to the MARPOL Convention to explain the decreasing trends in both parameters monitored. No description is made of the impacts of acute pollution on seabed habitats and functional groups but Belgium specifies that littoral sediment and birds are impacted by this type of pollution. No real judgement is made on the current level of the pressure in relation to GES but Belgium indicates that the situation is improving.";The initial assessment of contamination of the Belgian marine waters by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered partially adequate. Belgium provides quantitative information regarding the current concentration levels of relevant contaminants in the Belgian marine waters and how they compare to relevant assessment criteria (EQS and EAC). But it does not provide any quantification of input loads from various sources into the marine environment nor does it carry out an assessment of the impacts of contamination on ecosystem components. ;"- Quantitative assessment made for current levels of concentrations and how they compare with relevant reference levels (EQS/EAC)
- Lack of quantification of input loads from various sources
- No information provided on impacts on ecosystem components
- Short assessments for radionuclides and acute pollution";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Belgium has set 10 targets each associated with one indicator to cover Descriptor 8. The targets cover all aspects of Descriptor 8 (concentration and effects of contaminants and acute pollution event) except radionuclides, which is expected at this stage. Most of the targets and associated indicators are directly measurable and can be considered as SMART. They are quantified, though not directly but through reference to the WFD’s EQS or OSPAR’s EAC or EcoQOs and they are time-bound. They cover in detail the two criteria of the Commission Decision, concentration and effects of contaminants, as per the Belgium GES definition. It is interesting to note that target 33 clearly specifies that Hg, HCB and HCBD should be measured against the EQS defined in biota and not against the OSPAR EAC. This would suggest that this rule applies also to the GES definition, although it is not specified in the definition.  

Only one target, Target 42, is not specific in that it only indicates that occurrence, extent and impacts of acute pollution events should be minimized without specifying a threshold value or a quantitative trend. No threshold value or baseline is indicated in the reporting sheet. However, it should be recognized that this target is the “operational” target set by OSPAR for acute pollution events so its use should ensure a certain level of coherence across neighbouring countries. 

It should be noted that the indicator for oil-smeared beached birds differs from the EcoQO since it refers to a limit value of 20% of the total beached guillemots found dead or dying whereas the OSPAR EcoQO is set at 10%. The Belgian target is therefore less ambitious than the OSPAR one. The target on the levels of mercury in seabird eggs is also ambiguous in its definition in comparison to the OSPAR EcoQO, which refers to non-industrial zones in Norway or Scotland. The way the target is defined by Belgium seems to indicate that comparison should be made between industrial and non-industrial zones in Belgium. But in the reporting sheet, it is specified that the threshold value is the target level set in the OSPAR EcoQO. 

Only the two targets on acute pollution address specific pressures and human activities. The other targets and indicators can be considered as state targets/indicators although Belgium reports them as pressure targets/indicators. In any case, they are not geared towards reducing the level of a specific pressure. ";The set of targets defined by Belgium to cover Descriptor 8 is considered as adequate. It is measurable and quantified except for one target on acute pollution. It refers to the relevant EU and RSC standards and is time-bound. They are not very ambitious as they merely comply with existing requirements (or are sometimes even less stringent, e.g. oiled birds target) but as such are realistic and their achievement should lead Belgium towards achieving GES. ;"- All targets but one are SMART
- Target on acute pollution is the common OSPAR target
- They cover both criteria of the Commission Decision in detail
- Only state targets, no pressure targets
- Their achievement would ensure achievement of GES";3;Adequate
Belgium;D8;Consistency ;;"There is an inconsistency between the initial assessment and the setting of GES in that Belgium has not assessed the impacts from contamination by hazardous substances on ecosystem components when this is part of their GES definition. In addition, an assessment is made of oil spills with reference to MARPOL and OSPAR under Article 8 and environmental targets are set to address acute pollution but this parameter is included in the GES definition only from an impact perspective (OSPAR EcoQO on oiled guillemots).

The set of targets and indicators is consistent with the part of the GES definition referring to concentrations of contaminants. As regards the impacts from contamination, it is less clear whether the targets will allow the achievement of GES considering that GES is vaguely defined when it comes to “selected biological processes and taxonomic groups”. ";;;;
Belgium;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Belgium has set GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor and criterion level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. The definition at the level of the criterion however is different from the criterion defined in the Commission Decision, which refers to the levels, number and frequency of contaminants. The Belgian definition focuses solely on the concentrations of contaminants and the second part of criterion 9.1 on frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded is not covered in the Belgian GES definition. 

The GES definition refers to Community legislation and other relevant standards. These other standards are not further specified but Community legislation is, as Belgium refers to Commission Regulation 1881/2006 and Directive 2006/113/EC. There is no direct reference to the specific substances covered by GES but Belgium specifies “all measured contaminants”, therefore it can be inferred that this refers to the contaminants included in the scope of Regulation 1881/2006 and Directive 2006/113/EC. It is also not specified which fish and shellfish species are targeted by the GES definition. The qualification “for human consumption” is not specific enough to know which these entail for Belgium. 

There is no mention of OSPAR’s approach with regard to fish disease in the definition of GES, while Belgium uses it in its initial assessment. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. The GES definition (as stated in the Directive) directly refers to Community legislation and Belgium has specified further the relevant EU legislation (and related substances) covered by its GES. The GES definition is therefore measurable and specific. However, there is a lack of details regarding the fish and seafood targeted by the definition. In addition, it cannot be considered that Belgium has defined its GES at the level of the criterion as only one part of the criterion is covered (levels of contaminants) while the number and frequency of contaminants exceeding regulatory levels are not addressed at all. The inclusion of Directive 2006/113/EC, and therefore of contamination by microbial pathogens, in the scope of the definition is considered a good practice. ;"- GES defined at descriptor and criterion level but only partial coverage of criterion 9.1 (no mention of frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded)
- Relevant reference to Regulation 1881/2006
- Lack of details regarding substances and species covered
- Inclusion of Shellfish Water Directive in the scope of GES definition (+++)";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Belgium has not carried out an actual assessment of the contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances, whether in the reporting sheets or in the paper report. No justification is provided for this gap. In the reporting sheet however, Belgium has made a positive judgement in terms of risks for human health on the current level of impact from contamination on fish and seafood on the basis of OSPAR’s EAC on fish disease and compliance with 2006/113/EC (legal standards are not exceeded). It is not clear why the OSPAR standard is used rather than Regulation 1881/2006. In addition, there is no supporting text explaining this judgement. 

In the paper report, the only reference made to the contamination of fish and shellfish for human consumption is the conclusion that flounders meet the health standards required for being sold while mussels collected on breakwaters for monitoring purposes are not suitable for human consumption. This is therefore not in line with the judgement made in the reporting sheet.

Belgium has reported on microbial pathogens. The assessment covers bathing water, but no shellfish water. This is adequate in view of the absence of significant shellfish farming in Belgium waters. The assessment for bathing water covers the Belgium coast, and therefore the relevant geographical areas. There is a presentation of the level of pressures on bathing water, and a judgement (the beaches meet the Bathing Directive standard).";The very limited assessment made by Belgium on contamination of fish and shellfish for human consumption is considered inadequate. Belgium has made a judgement in the reporting sheet, which is contradictory to the very limited information reported in the paper report. In addition, the reporting on microbial pathogens in the paper report is focused on bathing waters and not shellfish waters, which is less of interest for D9. This is also contradictory to the judgement made in the reporting sheet in relation to Directive 2006/113/EC (Shellfish water Directive).;"- Very limited assessment and inconsistent/ contradictory between reporting sheet and paper report
- Assessment of microbial pathogens only in reference to Bathing Waters Directive and not Shellfish Directive";1;Inadequate
Belgium;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Belgium has defined one target and one associated indicators to cover Descriptor 9. The target defined by Belgium is actually the same as its GES definition. Even if it is a qualitative statement, it is relatively specific and measurable since it refers to EU standards (including the Shellfish Water Directive) and it is time-bound as the date for the achievement of the target is set at December 2020. However, as is the case with the GES definition, the target is not specific when it comes to fish and shellfish species that should be used to monitor progress and does not take into account the recent amendments to Regulation 1881/2006. 

The target and associated indicator set by Belgium for D9 do not cover all of the Commission Decision criterion and indicators for D9. The parameters on number of contaminants exceeding regulator levels and frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded are not addressed by the targets. The set of target/indicator proposed by Belgium does not address control of specific human activities and is not geared towards reducing levels of a specified pressure. Although Belgium considers them to be pressure target/indicator, they can also be considered as state target/indicator. ";The set of target and indicator defined by Belgium to cover Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. While the target/indicator defined is relatively specific and potentially measurable, it is an expression of GES (as it is the copy of the GES definition) rather than an actual target geared towards the reduction of a specified pressure or the control of human activities to monitor achievement (or maintenance) of GES. It does not address all aspects of the Commission Decision criterion and indicators and focuses solely on concentrations of contaminants. ;"- One target defined which corresponds to the GES definition
- SMART target through reference to Regulation 1881/2006 and Directive 2006/113/EC
- No target on frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded";2;Partially adequate
Belgium;D9;Consistency ;;"As the assessment made of the impacts of contaminants on fish and seafood is extremely limited and inconsistent between the paper report and the reporting sheet, it cannot be considered consistent with the definition of GES or the setting of targets. In addition, the judgement made by Belgium regarding current status is not made using the same standards as prescribed in the GES definition (use of OSPAR’s EAC on fish disease rather than Regulation 1881/2006). 

The set of target and indicators is consistent with the GES definition considering that it is a copy of the second part of the GES definition. It should be noted that the GES definition includes a reference to other relevant standards that the target does not address. Achievement of the target should mean achievement of GES but the target does not fulfil its role to guide towards the achievement of GES by reducing pressures or controlling human activities. ";;;;
Bulgaria;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Bulgaria has defined Descriptors 1 and 6 at descriptor and criteria level in the reporting sheet. In the paper report, GES is defined for different ecosystem components (fish, mammals, habitats) at criteria level. The definitions for D1 and D6 in the reporting sheet constitute the definition for seabed habitats in the paper report (covering both D1 and D6). The rest of the paper report definitions (e.g. on species or on water column habitats) is only partly included in the reporting sheet. 

It is not certain whether Bulgaria considers only the definitions in the reporting sheet to be operational or if all the definitions of the paper report should also be considered as part of what constitutes GES for D1 and D6. In the present report, the full definition in the paper report has been assessed. In the reporting sheet, Bulgaria mentions that specific criteria and indicators are reported under Article 10, adding a level of uncertainty as to what should be considered GES and what should be considered environmental targets.

The definitions in the reporting sheet are said to apply to various assessment areas (Shelf, Cape Sivriburun-Cape Kaliakra, Cape Kaliakra-Cape Galata, Cape Galata-Cape Emine, Cape Emine-Sozopol, Sozopol-Rezovo River). Surprisingly, Bulgaria does not report that they apply to the open sea or to coastal waters. 

Species 
With regard to species, Bulgaria only talks about fish and mammals in general but does not provide the list of the specific species covered by the GES definition. This would suggest therefore that the definition applies to all fish and mammal species that are relevant for the Bulgarian marine waters. 

The criteria defined for fish and mammals cover criteria 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. GES also requires a good status according to the WFD (for fish) and covers protected/listed species from legislation and international agreements (with no further specification of what these are). Seabirds and cephalopods are not covered by the Bulgarian GES definition for biodiversity. No justification is provided for this gap. The definitions at criteria level are quite general (e.g. “kept at a high level”, “abundance is high”) and no threshold values and baselines are provided for the GES definition.

Habitats 
With regard to habitats, the GES definition covers seabed habitats and water column habitats through the definitions on zooplankton and phytoplankton. Since no specific detail is provided under the GES definition as to which habitats are covered by the definition, it is assumed that all habitats are protected equally. Protected/listed habitats from EU legislation (Habitats Directive) and from national or regional agreements (Bucharest Convention) are also covered by the GES definition. 

In the paper report, Bulgaria states that the MSFD allows the Member States to identify cases when Articles 9 and 10 may not apply – the so-called “exceptions” under Article 14 of the Directive, which include “natural causes”. According to Bulgaria, for the Black Sea marine region, this is particularly relevant with regard to the deep-sea coastal slope and abyssal plain, which therefore could be excluded from the definition of good environmental status (or the setting of environmental targets). The primary reason for the omission is the presence of natural anaerobic conditions and toxic hydrogen sulphide gas at a depth of 150-200 m, preventing the development of biological communities of aerobic organisms, except for some anaerobic bacteria below this boundary.

The three criteria of the Commission Decision for habitat distribution, extent and condition are covered. The baseline for the criteria for seabed habitats is used in the sense of “reference conditions”, i.e. in relation to natural physical geography and climate. However it adds a condition which acknowledges the need to account for climatic variability but also the sustainable use of the marine environment.  This is also reflected in the last sentence which states that the functioning of ecosystem processes should support the provision of ecosystem goods and services and other marine uses. The definition allows for further degradation since it states that the “natural range and surface area of the predominant habitats and associated typical species do not decrease significantly”. A number of terms used in the definitions at criteria level are quite general and, without further specification, would make the GES not measurable (e.g. significantly, long-term, etc.) One of the criteria, on the impacts of human activities on physical substrates, relate specifically to D6 and cover, at a general level, the two criteria of the Commission Decision. 

For water column habitats, Bulgaria has defined a number of GES criteria for zooplankton and phytoplankton. The criteria defined by Bulgaria cover in particular criterion 1.6 on the habitat condition (and in particular indicator 1.6.2 and 1.6.3). The criteria are quite specific for phytoplankton while for zooplankton the criterion is relatively general (“not strongly or adversely affected by anthropogenic factors”). For biomass of both plankton types, the baseline is used in the sense of reference conditions, i.e. free from human pressures. 

Ecosystems
There is no specific definition for the whole ecosystem structure, looking at the proportion of the various ecosystem components. 

The GES definitions are quite general, only one criterion for phytoplankton is specific, integrating specific threshold value. For the rest, no threshold value or baseline is defined, which means that GES is not measurable. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 1 is considered partially adequate. The definition of GES for habitats covers all criteria and a number of indicators of the Commission Decision, and applies equally to all habitats, but it is quite general, using terms that lack measurability (threshold values, reference conditions, etc.) The definitions for species are more limited. While for fish, the definitions cover the relevant criteria of the Commission Decision, the definitions for mammals are much less developed. None are measurable anyway. Finally the GES definition does not cover seabirds at all. In general however, the definition for GES refers to the Habitats Directive and to the Water Framework Directive.  ;"- Definitions for habitats cover all criteria of Commission Decision and apply to all habitats equally

Bulgaria;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Bulgaria has carried out an initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage for the Black Sea. In the reporting sheets, the assessment covers five assessment areas for physical loss and eight assessment areas for physical damage. Bulgaria acknowledges the need to collect more information and reports the lack of an established methodology to assess GES in relation to sealing and smothering. For physical loss, the percentage of the environment affected by the pressure is reported (1-5% in most areas but up to 50-75% in “cape Kaliakra – cape Galata”) but the impact on seabed habitats is not quantified. The main causes of physical loss are indicated – land claim defence, ports and dredging. The seabed habitats impacted are also listed - littoral rock, littoral sediment, shallow mixed sediment and shallow rock. No conclusive trends or judgements are provided.

In relation to physical damage, Bulgaria listed in the reporting sheets the main causes of pressure as being fisheries, land claim defence, ports and dredging. The percentage of the environment and of the seabed habitats impacted (the same reported under physical loss plus shelf mixed sediment) by the pressure is also reported 1-5% for all assessment areas but for “cape Emine – Sozopol” (5-25%) and “cape Kaliakra – cape Galata” (25-50%) . Judgements are provided but only for the level of physical damage in the environment – “not good” in the central shelf, the northern shelf and in the southern shelf and “good” in the areas “cape Emine – Sozopol”, “cape Galata – cape Emine”, “cape Kaliakra – cape Galata”, “Sivriburun – cape Kaliakra” and “Sozopol – Rezovo River”. Bulgaria also reported trends only for the level of physical damage in the environment, which is “declining” in all assessment areas. 

The information in the paper report is more detailed and includes the quantification of a series of parameters. The report also includes maps showing where the main pressures are located. There is a special focus on abrasion caused by trawl fishing. Bottom trawling is prohibited since 2011, but pelagic trawling is allowed and the report considers that this activity is also a cause of physical damage.";The initial assessment by Bulgaria of physical loss and damage is considered adequate. The different types and causes of physical loss and damage as well as their impacts are documented. The assessment is both qualitative and quantitative and provides a fair amount of detail. Trends and judgements on the current status are provided even if not for all parameters. ;"Features:
- Covers all habitat types
- All functional groups except one (birds) covered
- Quantified information
- Trends and judgements provided in most cases
- Reference made to the HD and WFD";3;Adequate
Bulgaria;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Bulgaria has reported more than 70 targets and three to four times more indicators to cover D1 and D6. The targets and indicators are very specific, defined with quantitative threshold values. 

For species, the indicators cover fish and mammals. While most of the criteria for fish are detailed and specific, with reference to specific numerical indices, Bulgaria notes that because of data gaps, the baseline conditions and threshold values for mammals cannot be determined yet. The targets and indicators for mammals are therefore not SMART. Bulgaria does not provide a timeline for the development of the indicators.

The habitats covered by the targets include mostly habitats designed under Annex I of the Habitats Directive and for which Bulgaria introduces the corresponding MSFD and national classification (e.g. 1170 reefs corresponds to MSFD habitat type “Littoral rock” and includes the national biotopes upper mediolittoral with Chthamalus stellatus, Melaraphe neritoides and Ligia italica, bottom mediolittoral with Mytilaster lineatus and Mytilus galloprovincialis and mediolittoral rocks with Corallina, Nemalion, Scytosiphon and other macroalgae). The habitats covered represent the main zones for seabed habitats (littoral, shallow, shelf) except bathyal/abyssal which are not relevant due to the anoxic characteristics of the deeper waters in the Black Sea. The indicators for seabed habitats also cover a number of associated/typical species and communities (e.g. Mytilus galloprovincialis).

For seabed habitats, in addition to the targets, which cover the criteria of the Commission Decision, Bulgaria has defined a number of very specific and quantitative indicators. It seems that for a number of indicators, the baseline used is the present state and the objective to achieve GES is either to remain stable or to improve the state.  

Bulgaria has also developed specific and quantitative threshold values for water column habitats, many of which have been developed based on WFD analysis and studies. For zooplankton, Bulgaria mentions that there is a need for additional development of the indicators due to their spatial heterogeneity and the low sampling frequency.

A number of seabed targets are pressure-based, focusing on the main pressures on the seafloor (e.g. fisheries, bottom-trawling, dredging, etc.)";The set of targets and associated indicators defined by Bulgaria to cover D1 is considered adequate. Most of the targets are SMART (except the ones for mammals). ;"- Comprehensive set of targets (except birds)

Bulgaria;D1;Consistency ;;There is a relatively good level of consistency between the GES definition and the targets/indicators as these further specify the general GES definitions. However, by using this approach (general GES and specific targets), there is a risk that the targets are not sufficient to achieve GES. In this case, in particular for seabed habitats, the targets focus on specific habitats, which are already protected as per the Habitats Directive. ;;;;
Bulgaria;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Bulgaria has not defined GES for Descriptor 10. The justification provided for the gap is that there is not enough data and knowledge (specialised study) corresponding to the indicators of the Commission Decision.

The main sources of litter as identified by Bulgaria are rivers, trans-boundary and urban sources and shipping.

Bulgaria;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Bulgaria has defined GES at indicator level, for two indicators (2.1.1 and 2.2.1), at least in the paper report. 

With regard to indicator 2.1.1, while the reporting sheet only mentions the name of the species targeted and biomass, the paper report provides an actual definition of GES for the same species specifying that GES would be achieved if to maintain low values of biomass, reduction of the blooms and the range of distribution. 

The baseline is the current condition (2006-2011). The paper report indicates that the current status is considered as good with a biomass below 4 g/m3. It applies to coastal waters and Bulgaria has indicated that further development is needed, adding that it will be operational by 2018 if adopted without specifying what is involved by ‘adopted’.

The second GES definition is only included in the paper report and relates to the ratio between native species and NIS and the prevention of new introductions. Bulgaria mentions a proposed threshold for GES based on the ratio of NIS biomass <10% based on expert judgment. However, this is not reflected in the definition itself which only uses the term ‘dominated’ without further specifications. Prevention of new introduction is applicable to all NIS, without reference to their impacts.

The gaps in knowledge are described in the paper report, although some relates more to a lack of measures (2) or uncertainty about desirable measures than to actual gaps in knowledge (4). It notes that there is still limited knowledge about the impact of NIS on the environment, which prevents the definition of reliable indicator and, in particular, that:
1.	No specific monitoring is conducted to collect inventory data of NIS and in parallel for early diagnosis of the new cases of introduction;
2.	There is no effective control of ballast water;
3.	Although certain hot spots (ports and coastal areas) are identified for the development and spread of invasive species, there is no quantitative assessment of the impact with determination of the affected areas/volumes;
4.	There is no adequate answer if Rapana population should be managed by applying the principles of sustainable exploitation of local marine resources (setting maximum levels of catch quotas, size limits, etc.), taking into account that measures for protection of the population from an excessive fish effort would be in conflict with the environmental targets to reduce the invasive pressures and impact of Rapana.";The GES definition for D2 is considered as partially adequate. The first definition covers only one invasive NIS, for which GES should be maintained at the current level. The definition is quantified. As such, it could be considered as an environmental target rather than a GES definition (see also comments under environmental targets). The second definition (only reported in the paper report) partially reflects the minimum requirements (no new introduction) although it is not fully realistic as it applies to all NIS regardless of their impacts. In relation to further spreading, it refers to the ratio native/non-indigenous species. Gaps in knowledge are identified. ;"- First Definition covers only invasive species but is quantified

Bulgaria;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Bulgaria has provided an inventory of NIS, distinguishing between coastal and shelf marine areas, reporting respectively 62 and 36 species. In the paper report, it is mentioned that within the entire Black Sea ecosystem 217 non-indigenous species were reported with 102 considered as permanently settled, 20 considered as very invasive and 35 as moderately invasive. Shipping is identified as the pathway of introduction for 50% of NIS in coastal areas and 39% in shelf areas. An altered natural flow is indicated as the source of introduction for one shelf species. In the reporting sheets, aquaculture is the only pathway of introduction mentioned. In the paper report, the years of introduction and an indication of the degree of invasive tendencies of the species have been provided. The paper report also provides a graph showing the number of registered non-indigenous species in Bulgaria from the period from 1900 until 2011.  In the research period of 2006 to 2011, 20 new non-indigenous species were reported and it is stated that the risk of more introductions is high. 

In the paper report and the reporting sheets, the impacts from Mnemiopsis Leidyi on the marine food chain and its negative impacts on commercial fish species are well described. The negative impacts of Rapana Venosa on oysters and mussels are also well described as well as the fact that they are now an important commercially harvested species. Impact assessments have taken place mostly along the coast and are not spatially explicit. In the case of phyto- and zooplankton biomass, ratios of indigenous versus non-indigenous species are provided and impacts are described.

Bulgaria;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"In the reporting sheet

The reporting sheet indicates two targets, which are similar to the GES definitions provided in the paper report. The time-scale for both targets in the reporting sheet is June 2020. 
 
The first target is specific (targeting one particular NIS), measurable (quantified threshold) and time-bound. It appears realistic and achievable as it aims at maintaining the current conditions. However, it should be noted that there is some contradiction with regard to the baseline set as 1998-2011, which covers a period when the biomass of Mnemiopsis leidyi was far more significant than the value of the associated threshold.

The second target reproduces GES definition, with one important difference as the threshold of 10% is here clearly set. The part on the ratio native species/NIS is not fully specific as it does not target some well studied taxonomic groups (e.g. fish, macroalgae, molluscs) that may provide a measure of change in species composition, in line with the Commission Decision, but applies without distinction to all NIS. As a result, it is not measurable and achievable in the current state of knowledge. With regard to non-introduction of NIS, such environmental target remains unspecific and is not realistic. In addition, it is more an expression of GES than a target. The target is not SMART.

In the paper report

The paper report sets three environmental targets without associated indicators. No time-scale is provided.

The first target also relates to the prevention of introduction of new species and reduction of the risk although it is not clear which risk is covered. It is not specific, nor measurable.  It is more an expression of GES than a target. 

The last two targets are related to surveillance and research. The first target requires the carrying out of an inventory of NIS each five year. This is specific, measurable, achievable and realistic. However, the target does not determine when the first inventory should take place. The second sentence is purely informative. The second target relates to research method (genetic and molecular studies), without further specifications. It is not specific. Although the research method is identified, it is not clear what is meant by ‘extension’ (to particular species, building upon existing surveys). In the absence of specifications, this target is not measurable. It is not time-bound.";The set of targets and indicators defined by Bulgaria to cover D2 is considered inadequate. In the reporting sheet, one of the target and its associated indicator is SMART but only relates to one invasive NIS. The other target and associated indicator is not SMART. In the paper report, one target is very general. The surveillance and research related targets would allow to address partially the knowledge gaps identified by the Bulgarian report, but are not sufficient as such to reach or maintain GES. One could be considered as SMART although there is no deadline for carrying out the first inventory and the second target is not SMART. None of the targets in the reporting sheet and paper report address vectors/pathways of introduction of NIS.;"- In the reporting sheet, one target is SMART but only relates to one invasive NIS

Bulgaria;D2;Consistency ;;It appears difficult to judge consistency between GES and environmental targets due to differences between the reporting sheets and the paper report resulting in uncertainty as to what exactly should be considered as GES or what is set as environmental target. One of the targets is identical to the GES definition. None of the targets in the reporting sheet and paper report address vectors/pathways of introduction of NIS, hence would not be sufficient to reach or maintain GES.;;;;
Bulgaria;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Bulgaria has defined GES for Descriptor 3 at criteria level but integrates a number of Commission Decision indicators into the criteria. The definitions in the reporting sheet and in the paper report are identical. 

Criterion 3.1 states that the level of fisheries pressure should remain within the environmental carrying capacity, this does not necessarily suggest that Bulgaria’s GES definition requires F to be at Fmsy but could also be interpreted as requiring F to be at or below Fpa levels. The criterion does state that if Fmsy or the proxy F0.1 are unknown the secondary indicator from the Commission Decision will be used which suggests the use of Fmsy to determine GES. The criterion is however not sufficiently clear in this regard and furthermore it is not clear whether this threshold applies to all stocks.

Criterion 3.2 is phrased in a way that it is clear that to achieve GES stocks should be at levels capable of providing MSY and that in case MSY reference points are unknown the secondary indicator of the Commission Decision biomass indices will be applied. It is however not clarified whether all stocks should be at levels capable of providing MSY or otherwise which ones. 

Criterion 3.3 is defined but still requires further development. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 3 is considered partially adequate. The GES definition applies Fmsy and SSBmsy as well as the secondary indicators for criteria 3.1 and 3.2. Criterion 3.3 is broadly defined. Criterion 3.1 is not sufficiently clear on whether Fmsy or Fpa will be used to assess GES.

Bulgaria;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Bulgarian initial assessment on the level of pressure from fisheries has been reported on in detail. Bulgaria reports on the level of pressure from fisheries by providing the number of vessels, fleet tonnage and fleet engine power for their fleets. The catch per unit of effort with different types of fishing gear for several species has been provided for the years 2008 to 2011. Total catches for ten fish and one shellfish species has been reported for each year from 2006 to 2011.

The assessment of impacts on fish stocks provides a quantitative overview of fishing mortality for a number of species and indicates whether species are overexploited in relation to MSY or an appropriate proxy. According the Bulgarian report, all species are considered as overexploited. Trends indicate an increasing fishing pressure, with the status of stocks worsening. Assessments on spawning stock biomass (SSB) are also provided but not in relation to Stock reference points. The assessments cover both benthic and pelagic species. 

The level of impacts from mobile fishing gear on the seabed has been assessed: 84.34% of the seabed is categorized as being under heavy pressure, 14.5% as being under medium pressure and 1.17% as being under low pressure. Fish stocks are assessed as being at “not good” status. ";The initial assessment of Bulgaria of the fisheries pressure is considered as adequate.

Bulgaria;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Bulgaria has defined 15 targets and a number of associated indicators to cover Descriptor 3 in the reporting sheet and in the paper report. The Bulgarian targets cover three stocks. It is stated that a lack of stock assessments at the regional level and lack of scientific marine surveys at national level prevent the setting of targets for the following stocks: Trachurus mediterraneus, mullus barbatus, Squalus acanthias and Rapana venosa. 

The targets set should be achieved by 2020, however it should be noted that the phrasing for a large number of the targets require continued improvements even after the stock has achieved the target value which could be in conflict with biological and ecological possibilities. In regard to sprat it is also stated that the biomass index should not fall below 55000 tons and turbot 1700 tons, it is not clear whether these values relate to MSY, PA or other reference points. The targets include clearly defined Fmsy reference points for all 3 stocks and for turbot and sprat clearly defined length based targets. ";The Bulgarian targets are considered partially adequate. The targets define clear MSY reference points for 3 stocks and specific length based targets for two stocks. In relation to the other Bulgarian stocks it is indicated that there is no regional stock assessment or national scientific marine surveys. Bulgaria has however not set targets to close this knowledge gap. Furthermore a number of the targets do not have limits and therefore require continued improvements even when the target reference value has been achieved. Lastly as the targets address only three stocks they are not sufficient to achieve GES by 2020.;"- Clear MSY reference points for 3 stocks and specific length-based targets for two stocks

Bulgaria;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Bulgaria has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at criteria level in the reporting sheet and at criteria level in the paper report but integrating a number of indicators from the Commission Decision. 

In the reporting sheet, GES is defined with different baseline/threshold values for coastal waters, shelf waters and the open sea in terms of nutrient concentrations (albeit only ammonium), dissolved oxygen concentrations and phytoplankton community – for shelf waters, phytoplankton community status is defined in terms of community composition, but for coastal and open waters community status is defined in terms of chlorophyll concentration. However, in the paper report, GES is also defined in terms of water transparency, and indicators of nutrient concentrations also include nitrate and phosphate concentrations. The paper report also provides further insight to the use of phytoplankton community composition indicators, all lying within criterion 5.2.4.: 
•	Use of the diatom: dinoflagellate biomass ratio 
•	Biomass of Noctiluca scintillans (a heterotrophic dinoflagellate, i.e. a phytoplankter) expressed as a percentage of mesozooplankton biomass
•	Proportion (%) of Microflagellates, Euglenophyceae and Cyanophyceae (MEC %) in Summer phytoplankton communities.

GES with regard to dissolved oxygen concentrations is defined as a range of values, with lower thresholds to account for oxygen consumption as organic material is broken down and phytoplankton respire, and upper thresholds to account for ‘excessive’ daytime production of oxygen by photosynthesis – a symptom of eutrophication.

Nutrient ratios are discussed and results presented for these in the Initial Assessment, but quantitative thresholds do not appear to have been set (Criterion 5.1.2.). Likewise, water transparency related to increase in suspended algae (Criterion 5.2.2) is also discussed, but thresholds do not appear to have been provided. No account is taken of changes in macrophytobenthos communities (criteria 5.2.3 and 5.3.1) and all changes in floristic composition reflect changes in the phytoplankton(/zooplankton) community. No justification is provided for these gaps, in particular with regard to the phytobenthos community.

The approach used by Bulgaria is national, taking account of WFD normatives, However, whilst the approach relies heavily on phytoplankton community composition, it takes no account of the status of macrophytobenthos. It remains unclear which nutrients are included in the definition of GES and whether or not any account of the impact of phytoplankton on water transparency is included.";The definition of GES for D5 is considered partially adequate. GES is not a copy or reformulation of the MSFD. The division of Bulgaria’s marine waters into three groups rather than the more usual two types of water (WFD coastal and offshore waters) should enable greater precision in defining status. While at least one of the each of the higher level criteria have been incorporated (nutrient levels, direct and indirect effects), a number of lower level indicators have not been. The use of several phytoplankton community-based indicators should provide improved confidence in determining overall trophic status, but where there is sufficient light and physical stability for macrophytobenthos to grow, this community has been ignored, thereby weakening the overall trophic status assessment. There is some confusion over which nutrient fractions are included in the definition of GES (and which are target indicators) and whether water transparency has been included, but dissolved oxygen status has been incorporated in a robust manner by establishing both upper and lower thresholds. WFD normative definitions are referred to, so have been included for coastal waters at least, but it remains unclear how or whether WFD phytobenthos monitoring results are accounted for in the definition of GES. For those criteria employed quantitative thresholds and baseline values are employed.;"- GES is not a copy or reformulation of the MSFD

Bulgaria;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Bulgaria has carried out an initial assessment of the level of pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the Black Sea for three assessment areas – coastal, shelf and open sea. The assessment is both qualitative and quantitative and covers all the relevant nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) as well as organic matters and their impact on the marine environment. In the reporting sheets, the information reported follows the same structure for all the assessment areas: the main causes of pressure are indicated - agriculture, forestry, urban discharges and shipping; in several cases the total input loads are also indicated. The Kamchiya River is reported as the largest source of nutrients and organic matter enrichment of the sea waters within Bulgaria, while the transboundary impacts of nutrient and organic loads transported by the Danube River are recurrently mentioned. The information on impacts focuses on chlorophyll concentrations and phytoplankton. No conclusive judgements are made for the level of pressure or impacts but in most cases it is indicated that concentrations are below baseline levels (which are also indicated). Declining trends are also reported in most cases. No information gaps or future plans are described.

The information presented in the paper report is in general more detailed than in the reporting sheets. Although the focus is still on pressures, in particular the sources of pressures, there is additional information on the impacts of eutrophication.

Bulgaria;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"
In the reporting sheet and in the paper report, Bulgaria has defined a large number of targets and associated indicators to cover D5. The targets are concerned with achievement of quantified thresholds or a trend towards achieving/surpassing those thresholds for six criteria in the three types of waters recognised by the MS (coastal, shelf and open sea). In other words, there are six overall targets (reported here), with success judged against the achievement of different quantitative and qualitative standards in each type of marine water. The targets relate to the achievement of indicators concerned with nutrient, chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen concentrations, as well as three criteria/indicators covering phytoplankton community composition (diatom: dinoflagellate biomass ratio, biomass of Noctiluca scintillans expressed as a percentage of mesozooplankton biomass and percentage of Microflagellates, Euglenophyceae and Cyanophyceae in summer phytoplankton communities). No targets are set for diatom: dinoflagellate ratios or chlorophyll-a concentrations in coastal waters.

The targets are all highly specific and very detailed with the overall aim of achieving GES for Descriptor 5. However, they are also structured such that once the relevant GES thresholds have been achieved, there is still an emphasis to continue pressure reduction (notably with regard to trend-based targets/indicators). While some of the targets are identified as targets in their own right, others have been identified as associated indicators, but the distinction between the two is not clear. This has resulted in a wide range of targets/indicators for individual impacts, e.g. the thresholds for achievement of chlorophyll targets in shelf waters require monitoring of maximum chlorophyll levels during the main and secondary blooms of both spring and summer, as well as average chlorophyll concentrations during the same period(s), with areal and temporal achievement statistics requiring either continuous or very frequent monitoring. 

When qualitative targets are provided (e.g. “physical, hydrological and chemical conditions are suitable for the long-term maintenance of chlorophyll-a at a level unaffected by anthropogenic pressure”), the associated indicators, contain quantitative thresholds against which achievement of the target can be judged. However, the fact that so many indicators are provided for some targets is likely to result in impact-based targets being considered successful according to some indicators, but not according to others. It is not clear how the environmental targets/indicators associated with individual pressures and impacts will be collated to determine whether the effect is considered to be suitably controlled. This is a problem particularly for the target “physical, hydrological and chemical conditions are suitable for long-term maintenance of composition and taxonomic structure of phytoplankton communities at level unaffected by the anthropogenic pressure”, since phytoplankton community structure has indicators based on three sub-groups";The set of targets and indicators defined by Bulgaria to cover D5 is considered adequate. The targets are all SMART. The targets and associated indicators provide a combination of achieving GES thresholds, together with a series of alternative compliance statistics. The purpose of this appears to be to offer further protection of the marine environment against potential future increases in pressures, but perhaps also to address uncertainties over the selection of GES thresholds, bearing in mind the Black Sea’s history of eutrophication impacts and the fact that some 90% of the volume of the Sea is considered to be naturally anoxic/hypoxic. With regard to phytoplankton communities, these are by far the most complex set of targets and indicators produced by any MS to date. However, while the scientific integrity and thoroughness of the targets cannot be faulted, the assessment of achievement of individual targets could require too great an increase in monitoring frequency or spatial resolution, particularly when no targets have been developed for seaweed/seagrass communities. ;"- The targets are all SMART
- The targets and associated indicators provide a combination of achieving GES thresholds, together with a series of alternative compliance statistics
- The targets for phytoplankton communities are very comprehensive but might be difficult to achieve";3;Adequate
Bulgaria;D5;Consistency ;;"The targets and indicators are so complex that interpretation of their achievement may be controversial, particularly when none of the targets, nor the definition of GES, take account of eutrophication effects on submerged aquatic vegetation. The tidal range in the Black Sea is so small (typically a few centimetres) that intertidal vegetation can be said not to exist. Shelf and open sea waters are probably more affected by nutrient/organic loads from the Danube River and cycling within the Sea itself. The targets appear to offer greater protection to the marine environment than straightforward compliance with D5 GES thresholds, partly because of the use of improving trends to assess status once GES has been achieved, but also because of required compliance with additional thresholds to achieve those targets, such as those for nitrate and phosphate, when a GES compliance standard is only presented for ammonium in the electronic report.

The set of targets and indicators is sufficiently ambitious to achieve GES since the baseline conditions selected reflect the considerably improved recent trophic status of the Black Sea, compared to the extreme eutrophication problems encountered during the 1980s and early 1990s. Improvements in trophic status of the Sea have largely been due to the regional economic recession and the massive reduction in agricultural intensity preceding and following the collapse of the Soviet Union. There is, however, a requirement to protect the coastline from development and re-intensification of agricultural practices, not only in the MS itself, but also in the five other Black Sea Coastal Countries; and to at least maintain and hopefully reduce nutrient/organic inputs to the Sea via the Danube River, as well as inputs of nitrogen via atmospheric deposition. As with Romania, Bulgaria’s achievement of GES in its Black Sea waters, particularly in its non-coastal waters, is largely outside of its control.";;;;
Bulgaria;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Bulgaria has defined Descriptors 1 and 6 at descriptor and criteria level in the reporting sheet. In the paper report, GES is defined for different ecosystem components (fish, mammals, habitats) at criteria level. The definitions for D1 and D6 in the reporting sheet constitute the definition for seabed habitats in the paper report (covering both D1 and D6). The rest of the paper report definitions (e.g. on species or on water column habitats) is only partly included in the reporting sheet. 

It is not certain whether Bulgaria considers only the definitions in the reporting sheet to be operational or if all the definitions of the paper report should also be considered as part of what constitutes GES for D1 and D6. In the present report, the full definition in the paper report has been assessed. In the reporting sheet, Bulgaria mentions that specific criteria and indicators are reported under Article 10, adding a level of uncertainty as to what should be considered GES and what should be considered environmental targets.

The definitions in the reporting sheet are said to apply to various assessment areas (Shelf, Cape Sivriburun-Cape Kaliakra, Cape Kaliakra-Cape Galata, Cape Galata-Cape Emine, Cape Emine-Sozopol, Sozopol-Rezovo River). Surprisingly, Bulgaria does not report that they apply to the open sea or to coastal waters.

Habitats 
With regard to habitats, the GES definition covers seabed habitats and water column habitats through the definitions on zooplankton and phytoplankton. Since no specific detail is provided under the GES definition as to which habitats are covered by the definition, it is assumed that all habitats are protected equally. Protected/listed habitats from EU legislation (Habitats Directive) and from national or regional agreements (Bucharest Convention) are also covered by the GES definition. 

In the paper report, Bulgaria states that the MSFD allows the Member States to identify cases when Articles 9 and 10 may not apply – the so-called “exceptions” under Article 14 of the Directive, which include “natural causes”. According to Bulgaria, for the Black Sea marine region, this is particularly relevant with regard to the deep-sea coastal slope and abyssal plain, which therefore could be excluded from the definition of good environmental status (or the setting of environmental targets). The primary reason for the omission is the presence of natural anaerobic conditions and toxic hydrogen sulphide gas at a depth of 150-200 m, preventing the development of biological communities of aerobic organisms, except for some anaerobic bacteria below this boundary.

The three criteria of the Commission Decision for habitat distribution, extent and condition are covered. The baseline for the criteria for seabed habitats is used in the sense of “reference conditions”, i.e. in relation to natural physical geography and climate. However it adds a condition which acknowledges the need to account for climatic variability but also the sustainable use of the marine environment.  This is also reflected in the last sentence which states that the functioning of ecosystem processes should support the provision of ecosystem goods and services and other marine uses. The definition allows for further degradation since it states that the “natural range and surface area of the predominant habitats and associated typical species do not decrease significantly”. A number of terms used in the definitions at criteria level are quite general and, without further specification, would make the GES not measurable (e.g. significantly, long-term, etc.) One of the criteria, on the impacts of human activities on physical substrates, relate specifically to D6 and cover, at a general level, the two criteria of the Commission Decision. 

For water column habitats, Bulgaria has defined a number of GES criteria for zooplankton and phytoplankton. The criteria defined by Bulgaria cover in particular criterion 1.6 on the habitat condition (and in particular indicator 1.6.2 and 1.6.3). The criteria are quite specific for phytoplankton while for zooplankton the criterion is relatively general (“not strongly or adversely affected by anthropogenic factors”). For biomass of both plankton types, the baseline is used in the sense of reference conditions, i.e. free from human pressures. 

There is no specific definition for the whole ecosystem structure, looking at the proportion of the various ecosystem components. 

The GES definitions are quite general, only one criterion for phytoplankton is specific, integrating specific threshold value. For the rest, no threshold value or baseline is defined, which means that GES is not measurable. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 6 is considered inadequate. The definition is embedded in the definitions for seabed habitats and therefore covers equally all seabed habitats, in the absence of definition of more specific habitat. It does not refer to specific substrate types. The definition covers the two criteria of the Commission Decision at a high level but lack specificity and measurability (e.g. use of terms such as “significant”). ;"- Covers the two criteria of the Decision but at a high level

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Adequate, 3)

Bulgaria has carried out an initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage for the Black Sea. In the reporting sheets, the assessment covers five assessment areas for physical loss and eight assessment areas for physical damage. Bulgaria acknowledges the need to collect more information and reports the lack of an established methodology to assess GES in relation to sealing and smothering. For physical loss, the percentage of the environment affected by the pressure is reported (1-5% in most areas but up to 50-75% in “cape Kaliakra – cape Galata”) but the impact on seabed habitats is not quantified. The main causes of physical loss are indicated – land claim defence, ports and dredging. The seabed habitats impacted are also listed - littoral rock, littoral sediment, shallow mixed sediment and shallow rock. No conclusive trends or judgements are provided.

In relation to physical damage, Bulgaria listed in the reporting sheets the main causes of pressure as being fisheries, land claim defence, ports and dredging. The percentage of the environment and of the seabed habitats impacted (the same reported under physical loss plus shelf mixed sediment) by the pressure is also reported 1-5% for all assessment areas but for “cape Emine – Sozopol” (5-25%) and “cape Kaliakra – cape Galata” (25-50%) . Judgements are provided but only for the level of physical damage in the environment – “not good” in the central shelf, the northern shelf and in the southern shelf and “good” in the areas “cape Emine – Sozopol”, “cape Galata – cape Emine”, “cape Kaliakra – cape Galata”, “Sivriburun – cape Kaliakra” and “Sozopol – Rezovo River”. Bulgaria also reported trends only for the level of physical damage in the environment, which is “declining” in all assessment areas. 

The information in the paper report is more detailed and includes the quantification of a series of parameters. The report also includes maps showing where the main pressures are located. There is a special focus on abrasion caused by trawl fishing. Bottom trawling is prohibited since 2011, but pelagic trawling is allowed and the report considers that this activity is also a cause of physical damage.

In the reporting sheets the assessment cover the following assessment areas: coastal, shelf, open sea, cape Emine – Sozopol, cape Galata – cape Emine, cape Kaliakra – cape Galata, cape Sivriburun – cape Kaliakra, Sozopol – Rezovo River. The information is qualitative and quantitative and covers both water column habitats and seabed habitats. Bulgaria reports on its predominant habitats i.e. marine water – coastal, marine water – oceanic, marine water – shelf, littoral rock and biogenic reef, littoral sediment, shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shallow sublittoral sand, shelf sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shelf sublittoral mud and shelf sublittoral mixed sediment.

Bulgaria;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Bulgaria has reported more than 70 targets and three to four times more indicators to cover D1 and D6. The targets and indicators are very specific, defined with quantitative threshold values. 

For species, the indicators cover fish and mammals. While most of the criteria for fish are detailed and specific, with reference to specific numerical indices, Bulgaria notes that because of data gaps, the baseline conditions and threshold values for mammals cannot be determined yet. The targets and indicators for mammals are therefore not SMART. Bulgaria does not provide a timeline for the development of the indicators.

The habitats covered by the targets include mostly habitats designed under Annex I of the Habitats Directive and for which Bulgaria introduces the corresponding MSFD and national classification (e.g. 1170 reefs corresponds to MSFD habitat type “Littoral rock” and includes the national biotopes upper mediolittoral with Chthamalus stellatus, Melaraphe neritoides and Ligia italica, bottom mediolittoral with Mytilaster lineatus and Mytilus galloprovincialis and mediolittoral rocks with Corallina, Nemalion, Scytosiphon and other macroalgae). The habitats covered represent the main zones for seabed habitats (littoral, shallow, shelf) except bathyal/abyssal which are not relevant due to the anoxic characteristics of the deeper waters in the Black Sea. The indicators for seabed habitats also cover a number of associated/typical species and communities (e.g. Mytilus galloprovincialis).

For seabed habitats, in addition to the targets, which cover the criteria of the Commission Decision, Bulgaria has defined a number of very specific and quantitative indicators. It seems that for a number of indicators, the baseline used is the present state and the objective to achieve GES is either to remain stable or to improve the state.  

Bulgaria has also developed specific and quantitative threshold values for water column habitats, many of which have been developed based on WFD analysis and studies. For zooplankton, Bulgaria mentions that there is a need for additional development of the indicators due to their spatial heterogeneity and the low sampling frequency.

A number of seabed targets are pressure-based, focusing on the main pressures on the seafloor (e.g. fisheries, bottom-trawling, dredging, etc.)";"The set of targets defined for descriptor 6 are considered partially adequate as it is uncertain whether they will be sufficient to achieve GES since GES is defined for all seabed habitats equally and the targets focus only a selected number of habitats that are already covered by the Habitats Directive. The habitats covered do represent all the main zones for seabed habitats (littoral, shallow, shelf) and also cover water column habitats. Furthermore Bulgaria has defined several pressure based targets. (It should be noted that the targets do not cover birds).
";"- Targets only cover those habitats already covered under the habitats directive.
- While the Bulgarian GES covers all seabed habitats equally that does not seem the case with the targets which could therefore be insufficient to achieve GES
- Pressure targets are included.
- Targets cover all main seabed habitats
";2;Partially adequate
Bulgaria;D6;Consistency ;;There is a relatively good level of consistency between the GES definition and the targets/indicators as these further specify the general GES definitions. However, by using this approach (general GES and specific targets), there is a risk that the targets are not sufficient to achieve GES. In this case, in particular for seabed habitats, the targets focus on specific habitats, which are already protected as per the Habitats Directive. ;;;;
Bulgaria;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Bulgaria has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor level in the reporting sheet and at descriptor, criteria and indicator level in the paper report. However the criteria and indicators defined by Bulgaria are not related to the criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision. In the reporting sheet, the GES has been defined based on the assumption that the present status is GES (“preserving the present thermodynamic and hydrodynamic status”). 

None of the criteria/indicators refer directly to spatial extent of affected area or changes in ecosystem components. Because of the interlinkages between Article 9 and Article 10 in the Bulgarian report, it is uncertain whether the criteria and indicators relate to the definition of GES or to the setting of environmental targets. In any case, no threshold values or baselines have been defined for these criteria and indicators. 

The definition at descriptor level does refer to the criteria of the Commission Decision but it remains general and uses relatively vague terms (e.g. “adversely affect” or “significant”). The baseline used in the definition at descriptor level is used in the sense of “reference conditions”, i.e. prevailing hydrographic conditions, but with an acceptable deviation (taking account of climatic variations). The ecosystem components impacted are those covered by Descriptor 1, 4 and 6. If reference here is made to the GES definitions of D1, 4 and 6, then the ecosystem impacted include fish and mammals and certain water column habitats but also all seabed habitats. If reference is made to the targets for D1, 4 and 6, then the coverage of seabed habitats is much more restricted (mostly to Habitats Directive habitats).  

No reference is made of the appropriate WFD definitions and no justification is provided for this gap. No reference is made to the work done in the Black Sea Commission or in any other regional conventions. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 7 is considered partially adequate.  GES has been determined for Descriptor 7, but not based, it seems, on specific study of pressures, impacts and their relations. Parameters of the environment/impacts to be taken into account are specified (impacts on biological components described by D1, 4 and 6), and a list of criteria (related only to temperature/salinity changes) is given but no indicator or time reference is given, no threshold or scales. Based on this definition, it will not be possible to know if and when GES is achieved.;"- Parameters of the environment/impacts to be taken into account are specified  and a list of criteria is provided

Bulgaria;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Bulgaria has carried out an initial assessment of the level of pressure from permanent hydrographical alterations and their impacts for three assessment areas: coastal, shelf and open sea. The information included in the reporting sheets is very limited and common to all assessment areas. It is reported that there is no evidence of significant alteration in the physical characteristics of the marine environment but it is acknowledged that there is no sufficient data or long-term monitoring studies which would allow for definitive conclusions. 

The information in the paper report focuses on changes on sea temperature and appears to reflect the existing knowledge and literature. No information is provided on pressures or impacts in the reporting sheets or the paper report; nonetheless, in the reporting sheets, the level of pressure and impacts is considered acceptable (status is “good”) for the three areas assessed and the trend is always stable. However, it should be noted that some of the impacts reported under Descriptor 6 are described as resulting from “alteration of hydrological processes”. No reference is made to the WFD or the Convention on Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution.";The initial assessment of Bulgaria for permanent hydrographical alterations is assessed as inadequate. The assessment does not cover any of the relevant pressures and impacts. No reference is made to the WFD or the Convention on Protection of the Black Sea Against Pollution. In addition, the judgement of the current status as good is questionable, considering the limited information provided.;"- Does not cover relevant pressures
- Does not cover relevant impacts
- No reference made to WFD
- No reference to Bucharest Convention
- Unsupported status Judgement";1;Inadequate
Bulgaria;D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Bulgaria has set one target to cover D7. The target is defined in a very general way. It is rather formal in its formulation (“comply with regulatory regime”, “include cumulative impacts at appropriate scale”) and not targeted to any specific action or impact. It merely requires application of the existing regulatory regime and does not require extension or control for specified pressures or impacts. 

No clear link can be established between this very general target and those pressures and impacts, which could prevent the achievement of GES for Descriptor 7. One important feature is targeted (“critical boundary between cold and warm half year”), but the target doesn’t focus on any specific pressure or impact with potential negative effects on this feature. 

The target is made of several subtargets, one of which relates to the collection of more detailed statistical information in the three areas (shelf, coastal and open sea).

The first part of the target is measurable (as it is based on the application of regulatory regime) but no indicator is associated with it, which would make it more specific, or timescale is provided. ";The target defined by Bulgaria to cover D7 is considered inadequate. The target is very general in its formulation. It is measurable as it requires compliance with the regulatory regime but lacks specificity with regard to the pressure and impacts that can prevent the achievement (or maintenance) of GES. ;"- The single environmental target is very general 
- It is measurable but lacks specificity with regard to the pressure and impacts that can prevent the achievement (or maintenance) of GES";1;Inadequate
Bulgaria;D7;Consistency ;;"It is likely that the target, through the application of existing EIA/SEA regulation, would lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/ impacts however, without an assessment of the initial assessment made by Bulgaria of the main pressures and impacts, it is difficult to assess the full effectiveness of the target. 

Considering the general nature of both the GES definition and the environmental target, and without knowledge of the current status, it is not possible to determine if the target will be sufficient to achieve (or maintain GES). In any case, the target does not add anything to the existing regulatory framework. ";;;;
Bulgaria;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Bulgaria has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at the criteria level in both the reporting sheet and the paper report. In the reporting sheet, it has made a distinction between the coastal area and the open sea but the definitions are the same for the two areas. 

GES is defined in reference to background levels, which concentrations of hazardous substances should be “close to”. For substances produced by human activities, GES according to Bulgaria is when concentration levels are at zero. This reflects the long-term vision of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (Article 1).

In the paper report, Bulgaria mentions the WFD and the EQS Directive but it seems that GES is not defined in relation to these reference levels but in relation to “background levels”. The EQS Directive does not define background levels, it defines annual average (AA) and maximum allowable concentration (MAC). It is therefore not clear what Bulgaria means with “background levels”. However it is probable that they are lower than the EQS thresholds. 

It is clearer what is meant with “close to zero”, although Bulgaria does not define how “close” concentration levels should be to zero to be considered at GES. 

No information is provided regarding the matrices to be used for the measurements of the concentrations of contaminants. 

In the paper report, Bulgaria justifies the lack of definition for indicator 8.2.2 on acute pollution events by the lack of data and knowledge on this indicator. Nothing is said about indicator 8.2.1 on effects of contaminants. ";The GES definition for D8 by Bulgaria is considered inadequate. GES is defined very generally, and only for criterion 8.1 on concentration of contaminants. GES is not defined in reference to the EQS Directive but in reference to background levels. While the approach is in principle adequate and ambitious, following the goals set by the WFD, OSPAR and HELCOM, there is uncertainty as to what Bulgaria considers to be background levels. It does not refer to OSPAR’s BAC and the Bucharest Convention has not defined background levels. There is therefore uncertainty as to whether these are lower than the EQS, although it can be assumed that they are. This is strengthened by the second part of the definition which requires concentrations of contaminants discharged from human activities to be close to zero. GES is not at all defined for effects of contaminants (and no justification is provided) nor for acute pollution events (and only a very limited definition is provided). ;"- GES defined only for criterion 8.1 and very generally
- No reference to EQS Directive but to undefined background levels
- No coverage of criterion 8.2 on effects of contaminants";1;Inadequate
Bulgaria;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Bulgaria made an assessment of synthetic and non-synthetic substances and their impact on the marine environment of the Black Sea. In the reporting sheets the assessment covers only one assessment area: coastal (0-30 m below sea level). Bulgaria provides a quantitative assessment of loads and concentrations of hazardous substances discharged into the marine environment. Riverine inputs, in particular by the Kamchia river, are considered to constitute the main source of input of pollutants in the marine environment – 110 tonnes per year of synthetic substances and 19,18 tonnes of heavy metals per year (Cd, Zn, Pb, Cu and Ni). Urban waste water discharges (of major cities and tourist resorts) and industries are indicated as other major land-based sources of contamination; there was not sufficient data available to assess the contribution of agriculture.

Sea- and air-based sources of contamination are also referred to. The major sea-based source of pollution is shipping; during 2012 a total of 6775 cubic meters of petroleum-water mixtures, 646796 cubic meters of ballast waters and 1314 cubic meters of solid waste had their origin in shipping. As for air-based sources, it is reported that in 2010 Bulgaria contributed a total of 3.32 kg/m2 of lead (Pb), which is 7% of the total pollution by all the Black Sea countries, 61.3 kg/m2 (3%) of cadmium (Cd), 15 kg (1%) of mercury (Hg), 91.8 kg/m2 (3%) of benzpirene, through atmospheric deposition.

For synthetic substances, Bulgaria provides concentration levels in the environment  for the following substances: Lindane, Heptachlor, Aldrine, Dieldrin, Endrin, DD?, DDD, DDT, Benzo(a)pyrene, Benzo(a)anthracene, Benzo(b)fluoranthene, Benzo(k)fluoranthene, Benzo(g,h,i)perylene and Indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene. For heavy metals it makes an assessment of lead, nickel, cadmium, copper, mercury, zinc and cobalt. Bulgaria reports the species that were used to measure the concentration of the relevant substances in functional groups (both fish – sprat, goby, shad, bluefish, bonito, mackerel and herring - and mussels - mytilus galloprovincialis and rapana venosa). Both for synthetic and non-synthetic substances, Bulgaria indicates that the data available is not sufficient to make a conclusive judgement on the level of contamination in the environment or in functional groups, since the assessment covers either different time scales or different contaminants. However, for heavy metals, it is stated that the concentrations are below the limit values defined according to European and Bulgarian legislation. Bulgaria does not report on impacts on seabed habitats and functional groups due to the lack of data available.

The information available in the paper report corresponds to that reported in the reporting sheets although more detail is provided. Expressed references are made to the WFD and the EQS Directive.

Radionuclides
Bulgaria does not report on contamination by radionuclides noting that these are currently not monitored.

Acute pollution events
In the reporting sheets Bulgaria refers to acute pollution events but the information provided is rather limited. Bulgaria acknowledges that there is no regular monitoring on pollution events and their impacts on the marine environment. Nonetheless, it reports that there were no instances of acute large-scale pollution events for the period 2006-2011, but that 89 small-scale oil spills occurred during this period. The main causes of pressure are indicated – shipping, industry and urban discharge. The proportion of the environment affected by the pressure and of the seabed habitats impacted (littoral rock and littoral sediment) is reported to correspond to less than 1%. No information is available on the impacts of acute pollution events on functional groups. Despite the little information available, Bulgaria considers that the level of the pressure and its impacts on both seabed habitats and functional groups can be defined as “good” since no large-scale pollution events were observed.";The assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events by Bulgaria is considered partially adequate. Bulgaria reports on sources of contamination and input loads and makes an assessment of current concentration levels. However, it does not assess biological effects on species and functional groups or the pressure from radioactive contamination. No conclusive judgements or trends are provided except for radionuclides. In addition, the assessment of synthetic and non-synthetic substances does not cover offshore areas and is focused on areas already covered by the WFD. ;"- Input loads of contaminants reported
- Level of pressure reported
- No assessment on contaminant impacts
- Radionuclides not assessed
- No conclusive trends or judgements provided
- Assessment focused on areas covered by WFD not offshore areas";2;Partially adequate
Bulgaria;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Bulgaria has set two targets to cover D8 in the reporting sheet and in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, the targets are further accompanied by indicators. The targets apply to the open sea, the coastal waters and the shelf. 

The first target relates to reducing discharges from diffuse sources of pollution, including atmospheric sources. No target is defined to reduce discharges from point sources of pollution. No threshold value or baseline is associated with this target so it is not stated by how much this reduction should be and from which level. The associated indicator is indicator 8.1.1 of the Commission Decision. It is not associated with threshold values or reference condition so it is not clear how useful it is as an indicator for the target (i.e. should discharges be reduced up to the point where concentrations are lower than the EQS?)

The second target relates to indicator 8.2.2 of the Commission Decision on acute pollution events and it aims at reducing accidental oil spills. The associated indicator is indicator 8.2.2. Again neither the target nor the indicator are associated with threshold values or baseline conditions and they are therefore not measurable.

None of the targets are SMART. ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Bulgaria to cover D8 is considered inadequate. The targets are both pressure targets, in the sense that they aim to reduce a pressure, however they are not specific or measurable. Their associated indicators are not measurable either, they are only a repeat of the indicators of the Commission Decision. Because it is not measurable, it is not certain whether the first target is sufficient to help achieve GES. The second target does not relate to GES at all since no GES has been defined for acute pollution event because of lack of knowledge. It is therefore uncertain how this target will be monitored and measured. ;"- Pressure targets but they are not measurable or specific
- Associated indicators are a copy of Commission Decision indicators
- Second target on acute pollution events even though GES has not been defined for acute pollution events";1;Inadequate
Bulgaria;D8;Consistency ;;The introduction of a target on acute pollution events is inconsistent with the fact that Bulgaria has not defined GES for this indicator. In addition, it is doubtful that the set of targets and indicators are sufficient to achieve GES as they do not include any threshold values or baseline. Any reduction in discharges would lead to the achievement of the target but it is not certain that it would lead to concentration levels close to background levels. Even if GES is currently achieved, it is not certain that the targets would be sufficient to maintain GES by 2020.;;;;
Bulgaria;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);GES is not defined for D9 in the reporting sheet. The status in the paper report is not clear. The Directive and the Commission Decision are repeated. Bulgaria also refers to the relevant European legislation for the monitoring of contaminants in seafood and provides a summary of the current state of the environment and provides environmental targets (“objectives”). However it does not provide a clear definition of what is GES for Bulgarian marine waters in relation to D9. For the purpose of this report, it is considered that GES is not defined for D9.;Not reported.;- Not reported;0;Not reported
Bulgaria;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The assessment of the level of contamination of fish and seafood made by Bulgaria in the reporting sheets is already described under the section on the initial assessment for Descriptor 8. Bulgaria concludes that concentrations of heavy metals in fish and mussels functional groups are below EU (the report mentions expressly Regulation 1881/2006) and national limit values. Bulgaria does not report on the impacts of contamination on fish and seafood due to the lack of data available. 

Bulgaria made an assessment of the level of pressure and impacts related to microbial pathogens but only for bathing waters – 34.83% (i.e. 31 out of 89 bathing water bodies) are categorised as compliant with the mandatory values of the Bathing Waters Directive. The trend of the pressure is assessed as improving. The main causes of the pressure are urban wastewater and tourism. Shellfish waters are not monitored for microbial pathogens by Bulgaria. The report indicates nonetheless that the self-monitoring reports available in the Black Sea Basin Directorate do not show increased values of microbial pathogens in Mytilus galloprovincialis (but it is noted that these results should be read with caution).";Taking into account the information reported under D8, the initial assessment of the contamination by hazardous substances of fish and other seafood (including from microbial pathogens) is considered partially adequate. Bulgaria makes a limited assessment of the pressures and does not report on impacts. The assessment of microbial pathogens does not cover shellfish waters (only bathing waters).;"- Assessment on level of pressure
- Impacts not reported on
- Status of microbial pathogens reported for Bathing waters but not Shellfish waters";2;Partially adequate
Bulgaria;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Bulgaria has set one target to cover D9 in the reporting sheet and in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, the target is further accompanied by two indicators. The targets apply to the open sea, the coastal waters and the shelf. 

The first target requires compliance with national and European legislation on contaminants in fish and seafood. The target reads more as a GES definition (in particular considering that there is no GES definition). Although in the reporting sheet there is no further specification of what national and European legislation should be used, it is extensively described in the paper report (also referring to WHO standards). 

The two indicators are a copy of the indicators of the Commission Decision for D9. No threshold values or baselines are associated to these indicators, which means that they are not measurable and cannot help assess whether the target is achieved or not.

The target can be considered SMART since it requires compliance with predefined standards however the associated indicators are not SMART. ";The set of target and indicators defined by Bulgaria to cover D9 is considered inadequate. The target is actually rather a GES definition and the indicators associated are not useful to assess achievement of the target since they do not have threshold values. ;"- GES definition rather than target
- Reference to relevant legislation
- No threshold values for the associated indicators
- Target is not SMART";1;Inadequate
Bulgaria;D9;Consistency ;;There seems to be a high level of confusion between the GES definition and the target. The target reported by Bulgaria for D9 should rather be reported as a GES definition. As it is now, there is no point setting a target and indicators if GES has not been defined. ;;;;
Croatia;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Croatia has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at the criteria and indicator levels. The definitions provided in the paper report and reporting sheets largely match. In the reporting sheets, Croatia has included an assessment of the current status of the marine environment in relation to the criteria and indicators and has made an assessment of whether GES is considered achieved or not (see chapter on Initial assessment). 

Descriptor 1 is organised first by species groups covering separately marine mammals, birds, reptiles (Caretta caretta) and fish, and then by seabed and water column habitats. GES is defined separately for each of these groups using the criteria and indicators provided in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU.

Species
For mobile species, GES is defined for criteria 1.1 and 1.2 for mammals, seabirds, reptiles and fish while criterion 1.3 is defined for all species groups except marine mammals. Criterion 1.7 has been applied to define GES for the fish species group only. The GES definitions require that the distribution/occurrence and population sizes of cetacean, seabird and marine reptile (Caretta, caretta) species remain stable or increase and do not suffer significant negative impacts from human activities. The implicit assumption from these GES definitions is that the current situation represents GES. For fish species, GES requires that the distribution, population condition and size composition of fish communities are not significantly impacted by human activity. A number of weaknesses are noted in the GES definitions for mobile species: 
-	Croatia reports that the status of the fish community will be assessed according to individual targets for selected fish species, however it is not clear what these targets are. 
-	Croatia does not clearly indicate what it considers to be “significant” impacts – although the initial assessment (art. 8) states that fish are “significantly impacted by fisheries” – making the GES definition vague in this regard. 
-	The definition does not take into account the sustainable use of the environment as required by the MSFD.  

The GES definitions for mobile species are indicated as applying to a selected suite of species for each of the mobile species groups. The marine mammal applies to the bottlenose and striped dolphin which are the most common species. The Mediterranean Monk Seal is not covered by the GES definition which is understandable as this species is mostly extinct in the Adriatic, but it might be returning albeit in small numbers. The selection for birds includes the Cory’s Shearwater, Yelkouan shearwater, European Shag and the Audouin's Gull. This selection of seabirds was based on four criteria: they regularly breed in Croatia, exclusively feed on the sea, have a wide distribution in the Adriatic Sea and are listed in Annex I of the Birds Directive. Our assessment finds that the limited selection of seabirds does not cover all bird species listed in Annex I of the Birds Directive that occur in Croatian waters. The selection also lacks certain important functional groups such as coastal wading birds.  Finally, Croatia has indicated that GES applies to nine fish species (including Mullus barbatus, Scorpaena porcus and Epinephelus marginatus) which it selected according to six selection criteria (i.e. global importance, regional importance, rarity, sensitivity, keystone species and decline) and the availability of data. This selection of species includes demersal and coastal species but lacks pelagic elasmobranchs and pelagic fishes (e.g. herring, tuna). Pelagics (sardine, tuna) are however covered under Descriptor 4 which, similar to Descriptor 1, requires that the populations of these species are not significantly impacted by anthropogenic activities. An additional weakness in the species covered by the biodiversity GES is that mobile species such as cephalopods and crustaceans are not considered under Descriptor 1, 4 or 6. 

Habitats
The seabed habitats addressed under Descriptor 1 are settlements of photophilic algae and the algae species Cystoseira amentacea, Posidonia meadows and the seagrass species Posidonia oceanica and coralligenous outcrops and the coral species Corallium rubrum. Croatia has not used the same Commission Decision criteria and indicators to define GES for these different habitat types and species. Under Descriptor 6, the habitats addressed are soft and hard bottom habitats as well as Posidonia Oceanica meadows. 

For both photophilic algae and Posidonia meadows, GES requires that the distribution does not decrease due to anthropogenic activities and, for Posidonia Oceanica, that the depth distribution remains stable or increases. Therefore, it is understood that the baseline for photophilic algae and Posidonia meadows is the current distribution. For Corallium rublum, GES requires that the distribution is at the extent that ensures sustainability of the species. The trends and threshold defined for Corallium rublum are that the distribution is stable or increasing and not lower than the Favourable Reference Range values defined in the Habitats Directive. In regard to Posidonia meadows and photophilic algae settlements, the quality should not be (significantly) reduced by anthropogenic activity and for Posidonia Oceanica it should achieve good or high ecological status as per the WFD in order to achieve GES. In relation to Corallium rubrum, the species size categories should be at the level that ensures sustainability of the species and the structure and function of coralligenous assemblages should not be negatively affected by human activities to achieve GES. In regard to the size categories, GES indicator 1.3.1 requires that the number of adult specimens of Corallium rubrum increases; our assessment finds that this is however more appropriate as a target than a GES definition, as Corallium rubrum will not increase indefinitely. However, considering the current status of Corallium rubrum, as reported in the initial assessment, the recovery of Corallium rubrum will take many decades if not longer. One weakness noted in the GES definition for seabed habitats is that clear thresholds are still required in order to be able to assess whether the structure and function of Coralligenous assemblages are maintained. 

Water column habitats are covered by both Descriptors 1 and 4. Under Descriptor 1, GES requires that the taxonomic biodiversity and abundance are preserved in accordance with the prevailing conditions that are not significantly negatively impacted by human activities. Again, one weakness is the lack of definition of what ‘significantly impacted’ means.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 1 is assessed as partially adequate. Croatia has generally applied the Commission Decision but the concepts inherent to the different criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision are not always applied by Croatia when defining their GES. The Croatian GES for mammals, birds and reptiles generally require that the current status is maintained and is therefore measurable. The GES for fish is set at a general level, requiring that relevant parameters such as populations and population condition are not significantly impacted. It is not clarified what is considered a “significant impact” and there is no clarification of how this GES definition allows for sustainable use as required by the MSFD. In relation to habitats Croatia requires that the distribution and condition of Posidonia oceanica meadows, photophilic habitats and coralligenous assemblages (Corallium rubrum) maintain their distribution and a good condition. Thresholds are based on the current situation, WFD standards and HD standards. The definition does not cover habitat extent. ;"- Croatia has applied the Commission Decision but the definitions do not always follow the concepts inherent to the different Criteria and indicator
- GES requires that current status is maintained for a range of species groups
- For fish the GES requires that relevant parameters such as populations and population condition are not significantly impacted, it is not clear what is significant and how this will allow for sustainable use

- The GES definition does not cover habitat extent";2;Partially adequate
Croatia;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Croatia has provided data on the different species groups: mammals, birds, turtles and fish. Cephalopods as a species group are not addressed in Croatia’s initial assessment. Croatia has covered a limited number of representative species for each mobile species group. General descriptions are provided on the developments within the different species groups and where available population counts are provided (e.g. bottlenose dolphin, turtles, seabirds), but data on trends, distribution and other parameters for species other than some fish species are not provided.  

Croatia has reported that the current status of the different mobile species groups in relation to GES for Descriptor 1 could not be determined due to a lack of data.  In the case of Descriptor 4, Croatia states that GES is achieved for top predators. Specifically, Croatia states that the top predator community (tuna) is not significantly impacted by anthropogenic drivers. However, Croatia also states that tuna stocks were in a state of improvement but not necessarily recovered therefore the methodology used to conclude that GES is achieved for top predators is unclear. 

Habitats
Croatia has provided separate assessments on the status of its habitats in the paper report and reporting sheets. In the paper report, Croatia has assessed the status of the Photophilic algae and Posidonia oceanica using existing WFD assessments which found that most areas were at good or high ecological status. No detailed information on these WFD assessments is provided. According to Croatia, assessments of current status in relation to the distribution of the habitats could not be conducted due to a lack of data. Similarly, no assessment of the current status of coralligenous assemblages has been made by Croatia, allegedly due to a lack of assessment methods and data. Croatia however acknowledges that the abundance of Corallium rubrum has severely decreased due to commercial exploitation. Impacts on each of the three biogenic habitats have been identified; these include eutrophication, construction, harvesting, bottom trawling and various other impacts. 

In the reporting sheets, additional information is provided on the different types of seagrasses that occur in Croatia including Posidonia oceanica, Zostera marina, Zostera noltii and Cymodeocea nodosa. Some general information is provided for each of these seagrasses although no assessment in regard to Croatian waters has been made. 

Croatia reported on water column habitats by covering phytoplankton biomass, primary production (chlorophyll a), composition of the phytoplankton community and fluctuations of mesozooplanton over time.  Croatia has also made a judgement on the status of the water column finding it to be at GES. 

Ecosystems
Croatia has not provided a holistic assessment of the ecosystem; Croatia indicates that data is missing for the majority of the relevant components. ";"The initial assessment carried out by Croatia in relation to the pressure caused by physical loss and physical damage is considered inadequate. Croatia has only identified the different types of pressures affecting the seabed but has not provided any assessment on the extent, distribution or type of damage.  

Overall the initial assessment carried out by Croatia in relation to the biological features is partially adequate. The assessment covers the most important habitat types and the main relevant species although the information provided is very limited. Judgements have been made on the group conditions for several species groups although the methodology used to reach the conclusions is not transparent. Judgements on current status have been made in relation to most of the different Croatian GES criteria and indicators, and at descriptor level for Descriptor 1 but not 6.";"Features:
- Assessment covers the most important habitat types and the main relevant species
- Judgements are made on the conditions of serval species groups
- Methodologies used to make status judgements are not transparent
- Judgement is made on the status of the ecosystem, it is not clear how the judgement was made";2;Partially adequate
Croatia;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Croatia has reported on its biodiversity environmental targets very differently in the paper report and in the reporting sheets. The following assessment takes both sources of information into account. 

Under Descriptor 1, Croatia has defined targets for each of the separate mobile species groups and the seabed habitats referred to in the GES definition for Descriptor 1. Concerning mobile species, Croatia has defined four targets for marine mammals, two for seabirds, three for marine reptiles (Carretta caretta) and four targets for fish. Under Descriptor 4, Croatia has defined three separate targets applying to the three different target species/trophic groups (primary producers, sardines, tuna and swordfish). Concerning seabed habitats addressed under Descriptor 1, three targets have been set for Cystoseira amentacea, one for photophillica algae, five for Posidonia meadows and four for Coralligenous assemblages. Finally concerning the seabed habits addressed under Descriptor 6, four separate targets have been reported in the reporting sheets but these largely consist of a collection of more specific targets. The paper report also contains other targets which contain more specific thresholds, the relationship between these additional targets and those reported both in the paper report and reporting sheets is not completely clear. 

The targets for mobile species are essentially the same as the indicators reported under the GES definition. Concerning birds, marine mammals and marine reptiles (Carretta carretta) the targets require that the relevant parameters (e.g. distribution, abundance) remain stable or increase. These targets are SMART when there is sufficient data available to establish baselines. The target for birds concerning breeding success is however not SMART as it is only stated that breeding success should not be lower than expected; it is unclear how the ‘expected’ breeding success is quantified. 

Croatia has also defined a number of general targets related to pressures. Concerning by-catch of seabirds and Carretta caretta the targets are general and do not set specific thresholds for by-catch rates or, for Carretta carreta, a desired level of reduction in by-catch. The target regarding the ingestion of litter by Carretta carretta also remains general stating that this pressure should not affect population size. The targets concerning fish do not contain specific thresholds as it is stated that selected fish species should meet individual targets concerning their distribution, abundance and demographics; these specific targets for the selected species are not provided. 

The seabed targets are divided into targets on specific biogenic habitat types and targets on different substrate types. The three biogenic habitat types covered are photophilic algae, and in particular those consisting of Cystoseira amantacea, seagrass meadows, in particular those consisting of Posidonia oceanica, and coralligenous assemblages, in particular those formed by Corallium rubrum. The targets for the biogenic habitats are essentially the same as the indicators of the GES definition. Thresholds for these habitats have been set using the Habitats Directive’s Favourable Reference Range baselines, WFD standards as well as thresholds using the current condition of these habitats as the baseline as measured using specific parameters (e.g. distribution, abundance/coverage). The target on the maintenance of the structure and functioning of coralligenous assemblages is not SMART.

The targets for the different substrate types, hard substrate, sublittoral fine sands, sublittoral coarse sands, circalittoral muds, circalittoral sands and bathyal muds are all essentially the same. They require that the Good Ecological Status, as determined under the WFD, does not decrease, that the distribution of biocenosis is maintained and the species composition is maintained in accordance with the substrate type. Our assessment finds that thresholds still need to be defined for the targets, except where there are thresholds defined under the WFD. In the paper report however, it is mentioned that habitats should be at ‘good’ or ‘high’ status, as per the WFD, in order to achieve GES. ";On the whole, the set of targets and indicators defined by Croatia to cover biodiversity are considered as partially adequate. The targets contain a mixture of SMART targets and targets that still require defined thresholds. Thresholds are generally set to maintain the current condition or to be in compliance with WFD and HD standards. In regards to fish, the targets refer to specific species targets but these are not provided in the report or reporting sheets, nor is it clear how these will be defined. ;"- Targets contain a mixture of SMART targets and targets that still need to have defined thresholds

Croatia;D1;Consistency ;;The Croatian reporting has clearly related the GES definition, targets and initial assessment to one another. The way Croatia has assessed current status against its biodiversity GES definitions is however not always clear and the status judgements could therefore be challenged. One weakness is that the approach to defining the three descriptors is not always consistent. GES for Descriptor 1, to a large extent, uses the Commission Decision while it has not been used to define GES for Descriptors 4 and 6. Finally the targets under Descriptor 1 are often the same or very similar to the GES indicators, calling into question the difference between Croatia’s GES and targets.  ;;;;
Croatia;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"In the paper report, Croatia has reported a GES definition for Descriptor 10 that reproduces the MSFD Annex I Descriptor 10 text verbatim; it is unclear whether this is the official Croatian GES definition. The Descriptor definition is accompanied by an explanatory text that explains what is required in order to achieve GES, it is also unclear whether this is part of the definition or not. Croatia has not reported a GES definition for D10 in the reporting sheets. 

The Croatian GES definition, and in particular the explanatory text, focuses on the impacts of marine litter, indirectly covering Commission Decision criterion 10.2; Criterion 10.1 describing the characteristics of marine litter in the environment is not addressed in the explanatory text. 

From the Croatian explanatory text, it can be understood that marine litter should be below a certain threshold so that negative effects from marine litter do not occur, there is however at this stage insufficient knowledge to determine such a threshold. Due to the lack of clear thresholds, the indicators from the Commission Decision focus on trends of marine litter in the marine environment; this approach however is not applied by Croatia. Finally, Croatia has not defined GES for the different classes of litter identified in the Commission Decision, i.e. beach litter, litter in the water column and sea floor, micro-particles and litter ingested by marine life.";The GES definition for D10 is considered inadequate. It is not completely clear whether Croatia has actually defined a GES definition for Descriptor 10, and if yes it is unclear whether it consists only of a verbatim reproduction of the MSFD Annex I or also an accompanying explanatory text. No Descriptor 10 GES definition is reported in the Art. 9 reporting sheet. The GES definition and accompanying text are solely focused on impacts, not trends of level of marine litter in the environment. At this stage, no threshold value can be define for the impacts from marine litter, which means that the achievement of GES as defined by Croatia cannot be measured.;"- Not clear if GES is defined

Croatia;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Croatia has defined four specific targets for marine litter in the reporting sheets and paper report and, in the reporting sheets, has also made a link to one biodiversity target, which refers to impacts of marine litter on loggerhead seaturtles (i.e. Caretta caretta). 

Target 32 aims to reduce the total amount of visible litter on the shores and in the sea but the desired degree of change is not indicated; therefore any decrease would be considered an achievement of this target. The Croatian GES definition or the descriptive text describing the achievement of GES for Descriptor 10 states that GES will be achieved when there are no negative impacts from marine litter, therefore our assessment finds that the current reduction target would not necessarily lead to the achievement of GES. 

Targets 33, 34 and 35 are about the development of indicators for monitoring marine litter on the seabed and microplastics in the water column, on the coast and ingested by marine organisms. They are neither state- nor pressure-based targets but relate more to the monitoring programme or programme of measures. 

Target 4, which is also part of the biodiversity targets, states that marine litter as well as fishing bycatch should not affect the population size of Carretta carreta. This target includes a baseline (i.e. current population) but it will be difficult to find out whether mortality specifically due to marine litter has reduced. 

The reporting sheet indicates that all targets should be achieved by 2018. Considering the state of knowledge regarding marine litter, these targets are realistic. ";The targets as defined by Croatia are partially adequate. The targets consist of one pressure-reduction target and three monitoring targets. Additionally one biodiversity target refers to the impacts of marine litter on marine turtles. The pressure-reduction target however is not very ambitious at is it will be achieved if any reduction of marine litter is achieved even if marine litter continues to impact marine life, therefore this target would not necessarily lead to the achievement of GES. The impact target mixes both impacts from bycatch and impacts from litter and may therefore only have a limited effect on the reduction of impact from litter on turtles. ;"- Contains a pressure reduction target and 3 monitoring targets
- Pressure reduction target not sufficiently ambitious to achieve GES as achieving GES requires there to be no impacts on biota";2;Partially adequate

Croatia;D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);Croatia has reported some information on activities taking place to collected data on underwater noise and likely trends in underwater noise. While the Member State reports that initial underwater noise measurements have been undertaken and states that interesting information has been gathered it does not report any of this data as part of their initial assessment.

Croatia;D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Croatia has defined two monitoring targets in both the paper report and reporting sheets as well as two additional operational targets in the paper report. 

The monitoring target addressing impulsive noise is to set up a noise registry for sounds which fall within the frequency band 10 Hz to 10 kHz which corresponds to the noise levels described by Commission Decision indicator 11.1.1. The monitoring target addressing ambient noise is to set up measurements stations which measure ambient noise within the frequency bands as defined for Commission Decision indicator 11.2.1. 

The operational targets consist of one target to address the cumulative impacts of noise generating activities on noise sensitive marine species while the other is actually a less specific ambient noise monitoring target. The two operational targets are general and do not contain thresholds or baselines and are therefore not SMART. 

As a set, the target are in line with the recommendations to establish an impulsive noise registry and establish ambient noise monitoring. ";The targets as defined by Croatia are adequate.

Croatia;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The status of the GES definition for Descriptor 2 is not clear. In the paper report, the definition is indicated as being a proposed definition rather than the final Descriptor 2 GES definition.  In the reporting sheets, the GES definition for D2 seems to be the assessment of current status and therefore part of the initial assessment rather than the official Descriptor 2 GES definition. 

It should be noted that the assessment of current status, reported under Article 9 (instead of Article 8 as it should be) is using the Commission Decision criteria and indicators to assess against GES, rather than the definition reported in the paper report. Since the reporting sheet definitions seem to be part of the Article 8 initial assessment, they are not considered relevant as part of this assessment. Therefore only the ‘proposed’ definition of the paper report has been taken into account. 

The Croatian GES definition for D2 does not follow the Commission Decision 2010/477/EU and is defined at criteria level but not at descriptor or indicator levels. The GES definition addresses environmental impacts and introductions of NIS but does not include specific and quantitative thresholds or baselines. It does not refer to NIS population attributes such as abundance and distribution, as per the Decision criterion 2.1. On the other hand, the Croatian definition for criterion 2.1 refers to having the introductions of NIS by human activities under control. Our assessment finds that this would be more appropriate as a target that leads to the achievement of GES as it does not specifically refer to the state of the environment. 

Finally, the Croatian GES definition for D2 does not specifically refer to trends of NIS introductions and does not require that there is no new introduction of NIS. ";The GES definition is considered inadequate. The GES definition provided in the paper report is indicated as being a proposed GES definition while the reporting sheet definitions seem to be an assessment of current status against the Commission Decision criteria and indicators. The ‘proposed’ GES definition does not include quantitative thresholds or baselines and does not make reference to NIS population attributes, such as NIS abundance or distribution. Finally the Croatian GES definition for D2 does not require that there is no new NIS introduction.;"- GES definition is a proposal

Croatia;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Adriatic Sea through anthropogenic or natural means; in the reporting sheets, this list covers 113 non-indigenous species consisting of phytoplankton (15), zooplankton (16), macroalgae (16), zoobenthic species (44) and fish species (22). In the paper report, Croatia has provided a table with invasive species including phytoplankton (4), zooplankton (1), algae (4), molluscs (7), crustacean (1) and fish species (5). 

Croatia states that they consider the rate of introductions to be increasing. The Member State however does not consider the abundances and distribution of NIS entered through anthropogenic activity as high, indicating that, in this regard, GES is achieved. One weakness is that it is not completely clear whether the Croatian assessment that current status is at GES for NIS introduced via human activities includes or excludes Lessepsian species as these could also be considered to arrive through passive natural processes once they have arrived in the Mediterranean. 

Croatia reports that there is insufficient data to asses impacts from NIS but that it can be assumed that reduced biodiversity resulting from the NIS species Caulerpa racemosa and Womersleyella setacea occurs in some areas. No assessment of current status against GES is made for impacts by NIS. 

The main pathway/vector of NIS introductions identified by Croatia is the Suez Canal resulting in the increasing number of Lessepsian species in the Mediterranean. The Member State has also identified aquaculture, aquarists and shipping as possible sources of NIS introductions but does not fully clarify if they consider these specifically relevant to Croatian waters.

Finally Croatia has not made a judgement of current status against the full GES definition for D2 (only on rate of introduction from human activities) as they consider there to be insufficient data currently available. ";The initial assessment by Croatia is considered partially adequate. The assessment provides data on NIS currently present in Adriatic water and identifies vectors/pathways. The assessment also contains judgements concerning trends of NIS introductions and their abundances and distribution but it does not explain how these judgements are made. ;"- Relevant NIS are presented

Croatia;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Croatia has reported a single target which actually consists of five separate sub-targets to be achieved by 2018 as reported in the reporting sheets. The information reported in the paper report and the reporting sheets is consistent.

The sub-targets are indicated to be pressure targets but a large component is to improve monitoring and to increase knowledge about NIS introductions as well as to develop action plans to manage high risk species (measure). The actual pressure sub-targets (c., e. and d. to some extent) are focused on reducing the risks of introductions through various pathways (shipping, commercial fisheries). No state target has been included.

The sub-targets lack details, for example they do not specify which specific species or functional groups of NIS (e.g. plankton, fish) are addressed by the targets or what baselines and thresholds are used for the pressure reduction targets. While the sub-targets lack details and are not SMART, they should contribute to an improved management of NIS introductions and impacts. 
";The targets as defined by Croatia are considered partially adequate. While most of the sub-targets focus on improved monitoring and risk-management measures, a couple of them also aim to reducing introductions through human activities.

Croatia;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"In the paper report, Croatia has defined GES for D3 at descriptor and criteria levels, the definitions at criteria level incorporate specific indicators verbatim or relevant indicator concepts. The definition at descriptor level also includes a verbatim reproduction of the Descriptor text provided in Annex I of the MSFD. In the Croatian definition, the criteria are not numbered but can be recognised as relating to all three Criteria (i.e. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3).  In the reporting sheets, the GES definition for D3 seems to be the assessment of current status and therefore part of the initial assessment rather than the official Descriptor 3 GES definition.

The GES definition corresponding to criterion 3.1 refers to the pressure of fishing activity and requires that stocks are exploited in a way that restores and maintains populations at levels that can produce MSY. The definition however does not state that all populations should be exploited to achieve production at MSY levels and it does not incorporate either Commission Decision indicator 3.1.1. on fishing mortality or indicator 3.1.2 on catch/biomass ratios. 

The definition corresponding to criterion 3.2 requires that the spawning stock biomass of all stocks remain above Bpa in order to allow for the long term exploitation of stocks at FMSY. Our assessment finds that, while maintaining stocks above Bpa should ensure that the stocks do not fall below levels at which they fully collapse, this precautionary point will not necessarily ensure that stocks are exploited at MSY. The Bpa limit is often set below the limit value that will result in the MSY (SSBmsy). 

Finally, the definition corresponding to criterion 3.3 reproduces verbatim Commission Decision indicator 3.3.1, a close approximation of Commission Decision indicator 3.3.4 and also states that stocks should contain a high rate of old, large individuals. One weakness is that specific threshold values have not been defined, however this is acceptable considering the current state of knowledge. 

It should also be noted that Croatia has selected specific species as components of GES, which include the demersal species Merluccius merluccius, Mullus barbatus and Nephrops norvegicus, the small pelagics Engraulis encrasicolus and Sardina pilchardus, the coastal fish species Spicara smaris and Mullus surmuletus and finally the shellfish species Pecten jacobaeus and Venus verrucosa. This selection of species does not cover all relevant DCF species. It could be the case that this selection of species is only for the purpose of the initial assessment but more details on how this selection was operated are needed to make a full assessment. ";The Croatian GES definition for D3 is considered partially adequate. The GES definition incorporates the relevant criteria and several of the indicators. The GES definition does not require all stocks to be exploited at Fmsy or a relevant proxy. For the purpose of criterion 3.2 all stocks should be above Bpa which is adequate with the current level of understanding. Criterion 3.3 is defined using two of the Commission Decision indicators (i.e. 3.3.1, 3.3.4) and the concept that fish populations should contain a high rate of old and large individuals. The lack of specific thresholds is acceptable considering the current available knowledge. ;"- GES incorporates the relevant Commission Decision criteria and most indicators

Croatia;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Croatian initial assessment for commercial fisheries covers the stock assessments of the relevant species identified as the “GES components” (see section above). 

The demersal species are assessed using annual catch data to assess the biomass index, occurrence, mean length and the abundance of adults for a number of species in geographical sub area (GSA) 17 (e.g. Mullus barbatus). The small pelagics are assessed using the harvest rate (catch/biomass), lengths and age. Coastal species are assessed by looking at catch per unit effort trends and length-based data. For the species Spicara smaris, the stock is assessed in relation to Fmsy reference point. Finally, Croatia reports that the status of shellfish species could not be assessed due to a lack of data. 

In general, Croatia found that most stocks are overexploited, although they mention that the demographic structure of fish populations shows a more sustainable situation along the Croatian coastline than in the rest of the Adriatic Sea, which they attribute to differences in the fishing pressure. Croatia has not included an assessment of the Croatian fishing fleets. ";The initial assessment by Croatia is considered partially adequate. The assessment of current status provides an overview of the status of the stocks considered more relevant and includes a judgement on the overall status against GES.

Croatia;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Croatia has reported different targets in their paper report and the reporting sheets. 

In the paper report Croatia has defined targets for each of the Commission Decision criteria (i.e. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3.). The paper report targets are essentially the same as the GES definition as defined in the paper report. The targets relating to criterion 3.1 requires that stocks are exploited in a way that they can produce MSY but it is not specified whether this applies to all stocks or when this target should be achieved. The target relating to criterion 3.2 requires that all stocks are above Bpa, which is measurable, but our assessment notes that there is no date set for when this target should be achieved and therefore it is not timely. Finally, the targets set for criterion 3.3 contain no specific measurable thresholds, as is also the case for the GES definition. 

In the reporting sheets, Croatia has defined very different targets, which seem to relate strongly to the GES definition for Descriptor 4 reported in the reporting sheets. They can also be considered relevant for Descriptor 3. The targets aim at maintaining long-term stability of fish stocks in regards to various parameters such as biomass, distribution and length structure. Targets 12 and 13 should be achieved by 2018 while targets 14 and 15 should be achieved by 2020. One weakness noted is that, while the targets aim for long-term stability, it is not clear whether this requires any modification in the status of the current stocks in the near future as some stocks are considered overfished. As there are no clearly defined baselines, the targets are not considered to be fully SMART. ";The targets as defined by Croatia are partially adequate. The paper report targets require that all stocks are above Bpa and in general terms that stocks should be exploited at MSY. The reporting sheet targets aim at maintaining the stability of various parameters that are indicative of the health of a stock.

In the paper report, GES is defined and the initial assessment is done against the GES definition using the data available. The targets in the paper report are almost identical to the GES definition. In the reporting sheets however, the GES definition is a summary of the assessment of current status while the targets reported seem to relate more to Descriptor 4 than Descriptor 3. ;;;;
Croatia;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Croatia has defined GES for Descriptor 4 at criteria level. The definitions provided in the paper report and reporting sheets are different. The definition included in the paper report does not look like a GES definition but rather like Croatia’s explanation of the definition of Descriptor 4 in the Directive. Our assessment will be based on the information reported in the reporting sheet. 

Descriptor 4, as defined in the reporting sheets, is organised according to different trophic levels, the plankton community is the bottom level, small pelagic fish are representative of an intermediate trophic level and top predatory fish as the highest trophic level. The species selected do show a correspondence with the types of groups referred to in the Commission Decision, such as top predators and groups with fast turnover rates.  The GES definition requires that each level in the food web is not significantly adversely influenced by anthropogenic drivers; one weakness in the definition is that it is not indicated what level of impact is considered significant. The focus of the GES is also mostly on the interaction between humans and separate trophic levels, the interaction between the trophic levels themselves is hardly addressed. It should also be noted that the GES applies almost exclusively to the pelagic food web. Finally Croatia has not defined GES for Descriptor 4 using the criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision. ";The Croatian GES for Descriptor 4 is considered partially adequate. The GES definition for Descriptor 4 has not made use the Commission Decision criteria and indicators and instead focuses on assessing the status of species at three separate trophic levels ranging from low to high.

GES for Descriptor 1, to a large extent, uses the Commission Decision while it has not been used to define GES for Descriptors 4 and 6. Finally the targets under Descriptor 1 are often the same or very similar to the GES indicators, calling into question the difference between Croatia’s GES and targets.  ;;;;
Croatia;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Croatia has reported different GES definitions in the paper report and reporting sheets; however in the paper report, it is not completely clear what is considered to be the formal GES definition for D5. The paper report seems to indicate that the GES definition as defined by MSFD Task Group 5 (TG5) is considered the GES definition, but the text in the paper report is provided in red and within quotes indicating it might not be (text in italic and within quotes in the box above). 

In another part of the report, Croatia provides a table (table 5.2) that lists the proposed “Targets and GES definition.” The GES/target definitions provided in table 5.2 are not those that are provided in the reporting sheets for either Art. 9 or Art. 10. As a result of the unclear reporting, it cannot be fully ascertained what is considered the official Croatian GES definition for D5.  

The GES definition as reported in the Art. 9 reporting sheet can be read either as a definitions of GES or as an assessment of the current status in relation to GES. In general, the GES definition in the Art. 9 reporting sheet remains at a high level, mainly requiring that the ecosystem is not impacted by eutrophication. The definition however does state that the condition and functioning of benthic communities should be in harmony with natural processes and not adversely altered and that no values below the limit of hypoxia should be recorded.  The requirement that no hypoxia events are recorded provides a minimum threshold for oxygen concentrations. 

In the paper report, there are two possible GES definitions for D5. The first is the definition provided by TG5, which requires that biological community remains balanced and without impacts from eutrophication. The TG5 definition includes examples of the impacts that can be considered but does not include clear thresholds or baselines. The proposed GES indicator definitions provided in table 5.2 of the paper report do include clear thresholds and baselines against which GES can be assessed. Table 5.2 provides definitions for indicators 5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2; indicator 5.1.2 (nutrient/ratios) is considered not relevant as phosphorous is considered the limiting nutrient while indicator 5.2.2 is simply indicated as not applicable. The thresholds defined are based on the conclusions from TG5 and include thresholds for nutrient levels, chlorophyll a, the WFD benthic index CARLIT , the WFD index POMI , phytoplankton blooms and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bottom layer. The Member State’s GES indicators cover macrophytes and macroalgae but do not address macroinvertebrates or shifts in floristic species composition.  In the case of shifts in the pelagic floristic species composition, Croatia reports that this is currently too expensive to monitor and that research is needed to develop a usable multimetric index.";The Croatian GES definition for D5 is considered partially adequate.

Croatia;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Croatia has provided a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the status of Croatian coastal and marine waters in relation to eutrophication. The initial assessment includes nutrient measurements over time in Croatian waters. The assessment refers to status assessments under the WFD and states that several areas are considered to be at ‘good’ status and one area (Sibenik bay) at ‘moderate’ status. The text seems to imply that the rest of the areas are at ‘very good’ status but this is not entirely clear. 

The reporting also states that nutrient loads have increased although no quantitative data on nutrient loads is provided. Croatia states that a significant reduction in the level of eutrophication is expected in coming years through improvements in urban waste management. 

Finally, Croatia has done an assessment of current status against GES, which finds that GES is currently achieved, but these conclusions not accompanied by supporting data or explanations.

Croatia;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Croatia has set five targets in relation to Descriptor 5. The targets are the same in both the paper report and reporting sheets. They address nutrient levels, nutrient loads, chlorophyll a, macrophyte and macroalgae distribution and coverage, opportunistic macroalgae and oxygen conditions. None of the targets make reference to the WFD or relevant WFD approaches. 

A number of weaknesses are noted in the targets:
-	The first target aims to maintain existing nutrient levels, however the initial assessment seems to indicate that Croatia intends to lower nutrient levels, which would be in conflict with the achievement of this target. 
-	This target is also in conflict with itself as the second part aims to encourage proper use of fertilizers to reduce nutrient loads. This should lead to lower nutrient levels, which conflicts with the objective of maintaining nutrient levels. 
-	In target 3, the use of the word “coverage” is not entirely clear but it seems that it refers to the distribution of macroalgae. 
-	In the case of the fourth target, it is not clear what baseline or thresholds would be used to determine whether marine algae and seagrasses are within natural cycles. 
-	Finally, the last target states that loads to the ecosystem from anthropogenic sources should be maintained or lowered, however it is not clear if this refers to loads of organic matter, nutrients or some other anthropogenic input. 

The targets clearly require that chlorophyll-a levels do not increase and that the abundance of opportunistic macroalgae does not increase; these targets use the current situation as the baseline and their achievement can be measured. The lack of anoxic conditions and lack of mortality of benthic conditions can also be measured. ";The targets as defined by Croatia are partially adequate. The targets contain several measurable attributes and, as a set, address the relevant topics. The targets are however unclear in regard to various aspects and some contain internal contradictions. None of the targets refer to the WFD or relevant WFD approaches. ;"- Targets contain severable measurable attributes
- Targets as a set address the relevant topics
- Targets contain some internal contradictions
- None of the targets refer to the WFD or relevant WFD approaches";2;Partially adequate
Croatia;D5;Consistency ;;Croatia has used WFD approaches to define GES for Descriptor 5 in the paper report and refers to it in the initial assessment, however none of the targets refers to the WFD or WFD methodologies. The reporting for all three articles contains aspects that require further clarification.;;;;
Croatia;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Croatia has provided GES definitions for Descriptor 6 in the paper report and reporting sheets but the reporting sheets definition includes additional indicators that are not included in the paper report. The definition of GES at descriptor level as provided in the paper report is mostly a descriptive text of how GES will be assessed. 

In the reporting sheets, at criteria level Croatia has provided the same definition for both criterion 6.1 and criterion 6.2 and these criteria definitions match the definition in the paper report. The GES definitions at criteria level require that soft bottom and hard bottom habitats are maintained and that Posidonia oceanica meadows maintain or increase their distribution area and ecological quality. One weakness in the definition is that, in regards to soft bottom and hard bottom habitats, it is not indicated which parameters should be maintained or what is considered an adverse effect. Considering that many soft bottoms are affected by trawling, our assessment finds that it is unclear how the GES definition will be compatible with the necessity to allow for the sustainable use of the marine environment. In relation to Posidonia oceanica, our assessment finds that the GES definition is measurable. 

Finally Croatia in the reporting sheets has defined indicators 6.1.1, 6.1.2, 6.2.1, 6.2.2 which largely match the Commission Decision indicators, although there a few significant differences. These differences include referring to distribution rather than extent for indicator 6.1.1 and excluding the reference to specific multi-metric indexes for indicator 6.2.2. In any account, it is unclear whether these indicators are in fact part of the GES definition for Descriptor 6 or if they have been used only for the purpose of the assessment of current status. 

From Descriptor 1 Assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
The seabed habitats addressed under Descriptor 1 are settlements of photophilic algae and the algae species Cystoseira amentacea, Posidonia meadows and the seagrass species Posidonia oceanica and coralligenous outcrops and the coral species Corallium rubrum. Croatia has not used the same Commission Decision criteria and indicators to define GES for these different habitat types and species. Under Descriptor 6, the habitats addressed are soft and hard bottom habitats as well as Posidonia Oceanica meadows. 

For both photophilic algae and Posidonia meadows, GES requires that the distribution does not decrease due to anthropogenic activities and, for Posidonia Oceanica, that the depth distribution remains stable or increases. Therefore, it is understood that the baseline for photophilic algae and Posidonia meadows is the current distribution. For Corallium rublum, GES requires that the distribution is at the extent that ensures sustainability of the species. The trends and threshold defined for Corallium rublum are that the distribution is stable or increasing and not lower than the Favourable Reference Range values defined in the Habitats Directive. In regard to Posidonia meadows and photophilic algae settlements, the quality should not be (significantly) reduced by anthropogenic activity and for Posidonia Oceanica it should achieve good or high ecological status as per the WFD in order to achieve GES. In relation to Corallium rubrum, the species size categories should be at the level that ensures sustainability of the species and the structure and function of coralligenous assemblages should not be negatively affected by human activities to achieve GES. In regard to the size categories, GES indicator 1.3.1 requires that the number of adult specimens of Corallium rubrum increases; our assessment finds that this is however more appropriate as a target than a GES definition, as Corallium rubrum will not increase indefinitely. However, considering the current status of Corallium rubrum, as reported in the initial assessment, the recovery of Corallium rubrum will take many decades if not longer. One weakness noted in the GES definition for seabed habitats is that clear thresholds are still required in order to be able to assess whether the structure and function of Coralligenous assemblages are maintained.";The Croatian GES for Descriptor 6 is considered inadequate. The definitions in both the paper report and reporting sheets limit GES to stating that soft bottom and hard bottom habitats should not be adversely affected by human activities and that Posidonia oceanica meadows should be maintained or improved. There is no clear indication of what is considered an adverse effect. A strict interpretation of the Croatian GES for D6 would mean that the sustainable use of the seabed is not possible as these activities would still have an adverse effect. There are no thresholds set for Descriptor 6, except for Posidonia Oceanica which is also addressed under Descriptor 1. ;"- GES requires that no adverse effects occur on soft and hard bottom habitats, but it is not clear how adverse effects would be measured
- A strict interpretation of GES would mean that sustainable use of the seabed is not possible
- No thresholds are defined except for Posidonia oceanica";1;Inadequate
Croatia;D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Inadequate, 1):

The Croatian reporting on physical loss and physical damage is very limited. Causes of physical loss and damage are listed for the different habitat types as defined under Descriptor 1 as well as for soft bottoms. The extent of physical loss and damage is not quantified as Croatia states that there have not been systematic investigations of these pressures. The main causes of damage are identified as being demersal towed gear such as bottom trawls, beam trawls and dredges.

Biological features (Partially adequate, 2):

Habitats
Croatia has provided separate assessments on the status of its habitats in the paper report and reporting sheets. In the paper report, Croatia has assessed the status of the Photophilic algae and Posidonia oceanica using existing WFD assessments which found that most areas were at good or high ecological status. No detailed information on these WFD assessments is provided. According to Croatia, assessments of current status in relation to the distribution of the habitats could not be conducted due to a lack of data. Similarly, no assessment of the current status of coralligenous assemblages has been made by Croatia, allegedly due to a lack of assessment methods and data. Croatia however acknowledges that the abundance of Corallium rubrum has severely decreased due to commercial exploitation. Impacts on each of the three biogenic habitats have been identified; these include eutrophication, construction, harvesting, bottom trawling and various other impacts. 

In the reporting sheets, additional information is provided on the different types of seagrasses that occur in Croatia including Posidonia oceanica, Zostera marina, Zostera noltii and Cymodeocea nodosa. Some general information is provided for each of these seagrasses although no assessment in regard to Croatian waters has been made. 

Croatia reported on water column habitats by covering phytoplankton biomass, primary production (chlorophyll a), composition of the phytoplankton community and fluctuations of mesozooplanton over time.  Croatia has also made a judgement on the status of the water column finding it to be at GES.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Croatia;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Croatia has reported on its biodiversity environmental targets very differently in the paper report and in the reporting sheets. The following assessment takes both sources of information into account. 

Concerning seabed habitats addressed under Descriptor 1, three targets have been set for Cystoseira amentacea, one for photophillica algae, five for Posidonia meadows and four for Coralligenous assemblages. Finally concerning the seabed habits addressed under Descriptor 6, four separate targets have been reported in the reporting sheets but these largely consist of a collection of more specific targets. The paper report also contains other targets which contain more specific thresholds, the relationship between these additional targets and those reported both in the paper report and reporting sheets is not completely clear.

Croatia has also defined a number of general targets related to pressures. Concerning by-catch of seabirds and Carretta caretta the targets are general and do not set specific thresholds for by-catch rates or, for Carretta carreta, a desired level of reduction in by-catch. The target regarding the ingestion of litter by Carretta carretta also remains general stating that this pressure should not affect population size. The targets concerning fish do not contain specific thresholds as it is stated that selected fish species should meet individual targets concerning their distribution, abundance and demographics; these specific targets for the selected species are not provided. 

The seabed targets are divided into targets on specific biogenic habitat types and targets on different substrate types. The three biogenic habitat types covered are photophilic algae, and in particular those consisting of Cystoseira amantacea, seagrass meadows, in particular those consisting of Posidonia oceanica, and coralligenous assemblages, in particular those formed by Corallium rubrum. The targets for the biogenic habitats are essentially the same as the indicators of the GES definition. Thresholds for these habitats have been set using the Habitats Directive’s Favourable Reference Range baselines, WFD standards as well as thresholds using the current condition of these habitats as the baseline as measured using specific parameters (e.g. distribution, abundance/coverage). The target on the maintenance of the structure and functioning of coralligenous assemblages is not SMART.

The targets for the different substrate types, hard substrate, sublittoral fine sands, sublittoral coarse sands, circalittoral muds, circalittoral sands and bathyal muds are all essentially the same. They require that the Good Ecological Status, as determined under the WFD, does not decrease, that the distribution of biocenosis is maintained and the species composition is maintained in accordance with the substrate type. Our assessment finds that thresholds still need to be defined for the targets, except where there are thresholds defined under the WFD. In the paper report however, it is mentioned that habitats should be at ‘good’ or ‘high’ status, as per the WFD, in order to achieve GES.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

On the whole, the set of targets and indicators defined by Croatia to cover biodiversity are considered as partially adequate. The targets contain a mixture of SMART targets and targets that still require defined thresholds. Thresholds are generally set to maintain the current condition or to be in compliance with WFD and HD standards. In regards to fish, the targets refer to specific species targets but these are not provided in the report or reporting sheets, nor is it clear how these will be defined. ";"- Targets contain a mixture of SMART targets and targets that still need to have defined thresholds
- Thresholds are generally to maintain the current condition or to be in compliance with WFD and HD standards

Croatia;D6;Consistency ;;The Croatian reporting has clearly related the GES definition, targets and initial assessment to one another. The way Croatia has assessed current status against its biodiversity GES definitions is however not always clear and the status judgements could therefore be challenged. One weakness is that the approach to defining the three descriptors is not always consistent. GES for Descriptor 1, to a large extent, uses the Commission Decision while it has not been used to define GES for Descriptors 4 and 6. Finally the targets under Descriptor 1 are often the same or very similar to the GES indicators, calling into question the difference between Croatia’s GES and targets.;;;;
Croatia;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Croatia has defined similar but slightly different GES definitions in their paper report and Art. 9 reporting sheet. The GES definitions are defined at descriptor level. It should be noted that the GES definitions provided in the reporting sheet seem to be an assessment of current status rather than GES definitions. 

In the reporting sheets, the Croatian focus for D7 is on significant impacts of hydrographical changes on the ecosystem at large. The GES definition does not include clear thresholds and does not refer to appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters. The baseline seems to be the current conditions, which is in line with the recommendations of the Commission. From the definition it cannot be determined what are considered to be ‘significant impacts’. Finally Croatia has not used any of the Commission Decision indicators. ";The GES definition for D7 is considered inadequate. Firstly, it is not clear what is considered to be the formal GES definition for D7. In addition, GES seems to be focused on significant impacts on the ecosystem by hydrographical changes and it is unclear what are considered significant impacts. The GES defined by Croatia does not include thresholds and has not included a reference to the WFD normative definitions or applied the Commission Decision indicators. ;"- GES definition is vague

Croatia;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Croatian initial assessment is focused on long-term changes in hydrographical conditions related to climatic fluctuations. Some data on large-scale hydrographical changes and impacts on relevant parameters are provided. 

The assessment however does not address hydrographical changes or impacts resultant from small-scale activities such as construction works, river flow alterations or other activities that can impact hydrographical conditions at the local scale, these are however considered relevant for the planning of future measures. No reference is made to the WFD. Finally Croatia indicates that the current status is at GES as it does not consider there to be any permanent changes caused by human activities. ";The initial assessment by Croatia is considered inadequate. Croatia’s initial assessment for D7 is focused on large-scale impacts from climatic fluctuations but does not look at smaller scale impacts relevant to this Descriptor, such as marine construction or river flow alterations.

- Local hydrographical changes from human activities such marine construction not addressed

Croatia;D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Croatia in their paper report seems to provide a target that requires that the current hydrographical conditions should be maintained. The text seems to suggest that the focus of the target is on large-scale hydrographical conditions. However, our assessment finds that, as climate change is predicted to induce large-scale hydrographical changes in the future, it makes the achievement of this target highly unlikely. 

In the reporting sheets, target 26 refers to ensuring that the cumulative effects of developments do not compromise GES. Target 26 does not contain threshold values. The target also does not seem to contain a clear baseline but the text in the target reading “GES is not compromised” likely refers to the current status as a baseline; the target could however allow for habitat degradation if this is considered to not compromise GES. ";The Croatian targets are considered inadequate. The targets are vague without clear thresholds and baselines. The targets reported in the paper report and in the reporting sheet seem to have a different focus, the former is focused on large-scale hydrographical changes while the latter seems to focus on the cumulative impact of developments (constructions). ;"- Targets are vague

Croatia;D7;Consistency ;;The Croatian reporting in the reporting sheets and the paper report are not the same and in the case of the targets are significantly different.

Croatia;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Croatian reporting does not clearly provide a GES definition, therefore it is uncertain whether Croatia has defined GES for Descriptor 8. In the Art. 9 reporting sheets, Croatia reports what seems to be part of the initial assessment, therefore these texts are not considered part of the Croatian GES definition. In the paper report, the GES definition provided is a verbatim reproduction of the GES definition provided in Annex I of the MSFD. 

GES is not defined at criteria and indicator levels, although these are used as part of the assessment of current status. Also, in the explanatory text accompanying the GES definition in the paper report, Croatia indicates that the substances covered under Descriptor 8 are those exceeding EQS standards in coastal or territorial waters, however no reference to EQS standards is made in the GES definition itself. ";The GES definition for D8 is considered inadequate. It is not entirely clear whether Croatia has defined GES for Descriptor 8.

Croatia;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Croatia has reported on contaminant concentrations measured in Adriatic coastal waters. From the information reported, it is unclear whether this refers only to Croatian waters or the entire Adriatic Sea. Croatia also includes an assessment of the current status and finds that GES is not achieved in relation to contaminant concentrations but that it considers GES to be achieved in relation to impacts from contaminants. Croatia did not make an assessment of current status against GES in relation to acute pollution events. It is not clear what GES definition was used for these assessments. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Croatia has reported on concentration of the heavy metals cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) in shellfish (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and sediment. Croatia also reports that there are increasing (‘growing’) trends in Pb, Hg, and Zn while no significant changes are reported for Cd and Cu. No specific data on these trends or the concentrations of Zn and Cu is provided. Croatia states that some heavy metal concentrations (Pb, Hg) exceed background assessment concentrations (BAC) values mostly at locations where there is significant anthropogenic influence but it does not provide a map or further specifics. 

Croatia’s reporting on non-synthetic substances covers PCBs, TBT and the pesticides DDE and Lindane. Trends of the concentrations of the PCB congeners CB28, CB52, CB101, CB138, CB153 and Cb180 in shellfish (Mytilus galloprovincialis) is reported and concentrations of the congeners CB118 and CB153 are shown as measured across 18 sampling stations. Trends of PCBs show slight declines but still significantly excess of BAC values. TBT concentrations measured in shellfish across 18 research stations are also provided, and values significantly exceed BAC values. In relation to pesticides, average concentrations of Lindane and DDE over time (2002-2011) and DDE concentrations across 6 sampling stations are also provided in graphs. Reporting on sources of contaminants is very brief indicating that point and diffuse sources such as wastewater outlets, runoff, atmospheric deposition, riverine inputs and ship pollution introduce contaminants into the environment; no indication of total contaminant loads or loads from specific sources is provided.

Radionuclides
Radionuclide contamination is indicated as occuring at low concentrations during the past 10 years (2-4 Bq/m3 in seawater and 4-10 Bq/m3 in sediment). Croatia considers GES to be achieved for radionuclide concentrations.
 
Impacts from contaminants
Some data is provided on impacts from contaminants but the reporting on this is very unclear. 

Acute pollution events
Croatia has reported that more than 100 cases of marine pollution were recorded in 2010 but that impacts and effects on biota caused by these events are mainly unknown. No further data regarding acute pollution events is provided. ";The initial assessment by Croatia is considered partially adequate. The Croatian reporting provides relevant data on contaminant concentrations in shellfish and sediment for a select number of heavy metals, PCBs and Pesticides as well as TBT. The assessment also includes an assessment of current status. The reporting on impacts however is very unclear. Furthermore no data is provided on total contaminant loads or contaminant loads from specific activities. Finally only some very brief data on acute pollution events is provided.;"- Relevant data provided on several heavy metals, PCBS and Pesticides as well as TBT in sediment and shellfish

Croatia;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Croatia has reported three targets in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. Each of the three main targets addresses a specific indicator from the Commission Decision. In the paper report, additional text providing more specific targets or explanations of the targets is provided. It is unclear whether this text, or some of it, should be considered part of the targets reported under Art. 10 or if it should only be seen as explanatory text.

Concerning the target addressing indicator 8.1.1, there are considerable discrepancies between the target reported in the paper report and the target reported in the reporting sheets. The reporting sheet target states that current levels of detected contaminants should be maintained. However, this would not lead to the achievement of GES as the initial assessment shows that many contaminants occur at elevated levels. In the paper report, the target states that the current status of chlorinated pesticides should be maintained, even though the initial assessment finds that DDE is above BAC threshold levels. This means that the target would not achieve GES for pesticides. The paper report target also states that for metal and synthetic contaminants, GES should be achieved; in the additional text this is explained as requiring that heavy metals are close to background reference levels and synthetic contaminants close to zero without increasing trends. It is unclear if this text should be considered part of the official target, furthermore it is not entirely clear what concentration would be considered as ‘sufficiently close’ to zero or the background reference level for GES to be achieved. Our assessment finds that these are not precise thresholds. Finally, the paper report target states that data should be collected for priority substances for which there currently is not data, while the reporting sheet states that the current number of contaminants surpassing maximum regulatory levels should not be exceeded. Collecting data on contaminants for which there is currently no data might however find that some exceed maximum regulatory levels, therefore the reporting sheet target might be problematic. It should also be noted that it is not explicitly mentioned which regulatory levels are referred to, no reference is made to the WFD EQS in any of the targets or the accompanying texts. 

The target addressing indicator 8.2.1 on effects of contaminants on biota states that the current state for non-impacted areas should be maintained and that GES should be defined for waters designated as being heavily modified water bodies (HMWB) under the WFD; it is unclear whether non-impacted areas refers to all areas that are not considered HMWB or areas that do not show negative impacts on biota. In the initial assessment, it is stated that 67% of the area is at GES in regards to pollution effects while in 25% of areas biota are severely impacted, 8% of the area is indicated as HMWB areas with a good ecological potential. The target reported would therefore be insufficient to achieve GES. This seems to be supported by the additional “SMART targets” of which one requires that areas which were found to be at severely polluted levels or categorized as good ecological potential (GEP) should see a 10% reduction in the levels of negative biological effects. The biological effect indicators are detailed in the report and include indicators such as the general stress index in mussel or survival on air. 

In the case of indicator 8.2.2 addressing acute pollution, the target is simply to achieve GES, no further details are provided. Considering that GES has not been defined for indicator 8.2.2, it is not clear what this target relates to. ";The Croatian targets are considered inadequate. The reported targets  in the reporting sheets and paper report contain many aspects that are vague. The targets reported in the paper report and reporting sheet are not always coherent and sometimes contradictory. In the paper report the “general” targets are somewhat more specific and are accompanied by additional texts clarifying the targets further, however it is not clear whether this accompanying text should be considered part of the Article 10 reporting. Both the paper report targets and the report sheet targets are not sufficient to achieve GES. ;"- Targets are vague and non-specific
- Targets do not contain specific thresholds or baselines
- Targets do not make reference relevant EU standards
- Targets are not sufficient to achieve GES";1;Inadequate
Croatia;D8;Consistency ;;The information reported in the reporting sheets and the paper report contain significant discrepancies. The initial assessment and the targets both refer to OSPAR criteria (BAC, EAC) but Croatia does not specify why it chose to do their assessment against OSPAR Criteria rather than WFD criteria and none of these standards are used in their GES definition. ;;;;
Croatia;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Croatian reporting does not indicate clearly what the official GES definition for Descriptor 9 is. In the Art. 9 reporting sheet, the text provided is an assessment of current status against GES but no clear GES definition is provided. In the paper report, the Descriptor 9 text from Annex I MSFD is provided verbatim as the definition of GES. It is however not entirely clear whether this is actually considered as the official GES definition. The Commission Decision criteria and indicators are presented in the paper report but not presented as part of the GES definition. 

The GES definition as provided in Annex I of the MSFD states that contaminants in seafood should not exceed levels established by EU legislation. The text of the paper report Croatia however states that in order for GES to be achieved “exceedances should be minimised.” As part of the initial assessment, a GES threshold is proposed requiring that “the maximum threshold values may only be exceeded in 5% of fish or shellfish for each parameter during one year”. The relevant pieces of EU legislation listed by Croatia and used as part of their initial assessment are Commission Regulations No 1881/2006, No 629/2008, No 1259/2012, No 786/2013 and No 853/2004 as well as “other agreements”, without further specifying what these are. ";The GES definition is considered inadequate since it cannot be verified that Croatia has an official definition of GES for Descriptor 9. The complementary texts further indicates that GES is not yet defined as the threshold for the maximum frequency that regulatory standards can be exceeded (5%) is indicated as being a proposal. ;"- Not clear if GES is defined
- Threshold reported in the accompanying text is still only a proposal";1;Inadequate
Croatia;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Croatia has done an assessment of current status of seafood contamination against GES. More specifically, the current status has been assessed for three heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Pb), organic contaminants (Organochlorine compounds), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and radionuclides. Contaminants were measured in the fish species hake (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), sea bream (Pagellus erythrinus), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus), mackerel (Scomber japonicas) and picarel (Spicara smaris) and one shellfish species mussel (mytilus galloprovincialis). All contaminants in seafood from the eastern Adriatic were found to be below threshold values as defined in regulation 1881/2006, with the exception of lead in mussels where some samples were above the maximum permitted level. Croatia considers that GES is achieved as only one sample was found to contain a lead concentration over the maximum permitted level in 2011. 

Microbial pathogens
The Croatian report states that bathing water quality assessments found that more than 90% of coastal waters was in excellent status. Furthermore a ten-year analysis has found that the number of beaches meeting the criteria of ‘excellent water quality’ is increasing. ";The initial assessment by Croatia is considered adequate. The Croatian assessment provides a judgement on current status (at GES) and provides data on concentrations of relevant seafood contaminants in a wide range of fish marine species and one shellfish species. The assessment also addresses microbial pathogens as measured under the Bathing Water Directive.;"- The assessment provides relevant data on contaminants in seafood
- The assessment contains a judgement in related to GES
- Microbial pathogens are reported on";3;Adequate
Croatia;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Croatia has defined two targets in the reporting sheets and one main target in the paper report for D9. The paper report target however is accompanied by objectives which read as sub-targets. 

Both the paper report target and the reporting sheet targets are aimed at maintaining the current state, however our assessment finds that the targets should also allow for an improvement in the current state. Target 31 of the paper report also states that the maximum threshold values may only be exceeded in 5% of fish “or” shellfish. This could be interpreted as meaning that the target is achieved even if the threshold levels are exceeded more than that in either fish or shellfish as long as one stays below the 5% threshold. Presumably Croatia meant “and” instead of “or”. 

The additional “objectives” or sub-targets require further operational action, such as further defining the monitoring programme standards. They also include a general pressure target to reduce input of contaminants but it lacks threshold values and baseline to be considered measurable. 

The last sub-target is unclear as it states that the state of GES needs to be defined if parameters are not in compliance with regulatory values. However, our assessment finds that if GES is not achieved, then the level of pressure needs to be adapted rather than the GES definition itself. ";The Croatian targets for D9 are considered inadequate. The main target is to maintain the current state, however our assessment finds that the targets should also allow for an improvement in the current state, especially as some lead concentrations are above the maximum allowable threshold. Furthermore some of the wording in the targets is vague and can be interpreted in multiple ways. ;"- Main target is to maintain current contaminant levels, however the target should allow for improvements 
- Some targets are vague, can be interpreted in multiple ways";1;Inadequate
Croatia;D9;Consistency ;;Croatia has assessed the current status of seafood contamination in relation to GES, however it is unclear whether Croatia has actually defined GES for Descriptor 9. The GES definition reported in the Art. 9 reporting sheets are considered to be actually part of the initial assessment. Lastly the targets reported in the reporting sheets are more developed than the target in the paper report although the same or similar information is reported in the general texts. ;;;;
Cyprus;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at descriptor level in the paper report and the reporting sheet. The Cypriot GES definition can be separated into two parts, the first part is very general, recalling that GES is to be achieved by 2020, while the second part is a verbatim reproduction of the GES definition as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. The criteria of the Commission Decision are addressed only insofar as they are covered by the general definition at descriptor level (e.g. abundance of species) but Cyprus does not specify them further. 

In the paper report the GES definition is explained in more detail by providing conclusions from various guidance documents such as those from the JRC and ICES, but Cyprus does not refer to other relevant EU legislation (Water Framework Directive, Habitats and Birds Directives) or to the ecosystem approach of UNEP/MAP.

Neither in the paper report or the reporting sheets does Cyprus provide a GES definition for Descriptor 1 that is specific to Cyprus waters. The GES definition as provided in the reporting sheets also states that this is the GES to be used in 2020 while the definition should not be time-specific. In the reporting sheet, Cyprus provides a long list of the ecosystem features covered by the GES definition, which includes a number of relevant seabed habitat types covering the main zones (shallow, littoral, shelf and marine coast and shelf) but includes only fish functional groups and none of the other species groups (e.g. birds or marine mammals).";The definition of GES for D1 is considered inadequate. The GES definition provided in the reporting sheets is largely a verbatim reproduction of the Annex I GES definition.

Cyprus;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
In the reporting sheets, Cyprus has reported on the following species groups, albeit with different levels of detail: birds, mammals, fish and cephalopods. In addition, Cyprus reported on a few individual species – Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta and Monachus monachus. In relation to species groups, but only for birds and fish, a description of the group condition and relative abundances, as well as the current status as compared with the natural status is provided (in line in all cases, but for relative abundance of fish which is reported as altered) as is the proportion of change per reference to this natural status (less than 1 % in all cases). Still only for birds and fish, trends and judgements on the current status are indicated - no problems are reported in relation to birds but the overall status of fish is considered not good and with a declining trend. The main pressures are only reported in relation to fish. 

The information relative to the individual species reported follows the same structure. All of these species are assessed to be in a good status, Chelonia mydas and Monachus monachus are considered stable but the situation of Caretta caretta is actually improving. In the paper report the information is more comprehensive and covers a considerable number of additional individual species under each of the species group. The Habitats and Birds Directives, and in particular the habitats listed under this Directive, and UNEP/MAP are systematically referred; other international conventions (Berne, Barcelona, CITES) are also mentioned.

Habitats
Cyprus has carried out an initial assessment on both seabed and water column habitats. The assessment is mainly qualitative. In the reporting sheets, Cyprus reports all the information under predominant/special habitats covering the following: Water Column all, Seabed all, Posidonia Beds, Reefs, Sea Caves and Sandbanks. In the paper report, Cyprus reports on a series of special habitats, using as a reference the relevant Natura 2000 habitats, and has specific sections on phytoplankton, zooplankton, angiosperms, macroalgae and invertebrate bottom fauna communities. 

The information in the reporting sheets includes for each type of habitat a brief description of the habitat distribution, extent and condition. The current status as compared with the natural status is provided (always in line) as is the proportion of change per reference to this natural status (always less than 1%). Trends (stable in all cases) and judgements (always good) on the current status of the habitats are also provided for all habitats reported. The main pressures are only indicated in relation to the predominant habitats (physical loss and smothering). Principally in the paper report, the Habitats Directive, and in particular the habitats listed under this Directive, and UNEP/MED are systematically referred to; other international conventions (Berne, Barcelona) are also mentioned.

Ecosystems
Cyprus has addressed two ecosystems in the reporting sheet and in the paper report – the inshore ecosystem and the offshore ecosystem. Nonetheless the information is very limited and Cyprus acknowledges a series of knowledge gaps, particularly in relation to the food web structure. No trends or judgements are provided due to insufficient data and the main pressures are only reported for the inshore ecosystem (extraction of fish and shellfish and introduction of non-indigenous species).";The initial assessment by Cyprus of biological features is considered partially adequate. The information is qualitative and quantitative and covers most habitat types and species groups, as well as a few individual species. However, the information provided is not always very detailed. In addition, the information on pressures is rather limited. Trend and judgements on status are provided in most cases and the relevant international conservation agreements and the Habitats and Birds Directives are consistently referred to. Although very limited, there is also an assessment of the existing ecosystems.;"Features:

Cyprus;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The two targets provided by Cyprus in regard to biodiversity are verbatim copies of the GES definitions although Target 1 is developed a bit further. This second part of Target 1 starting with the text “quantitative target” refers to a methodology used by Cyprus to assess the current status of Cypriot marine waters in regard to GES and the proposed targets and associated indicators for the period of 2012 to 2018.

The methodology referred to in Target 1 is further explained in the paper report. This methodology sets as targets that univariate biotic indices and simple parameters where the observed variability is high should have a divergence from the reference conditions that is equal to or not greater than 50% and for multivariate biotic indices, qualitative indices and abiotic parameters, a divergence equal to or less than 25% should be achieved. It is stated that the quantitative targets most commonly relate to values from reference stations however it is not clarified in what way. It is also not clarified in the report from which reference conditions the divergence will be measured. Since the reference conditions are not specified, these targets cannot be properly evaluated.";The set of targets and indicators defined by Cyprus for Descriptors 1 and 6 are considered inadequate. The targets in the reporting sheet are verbatim reproductions of the GES definitions except for a small part of Target 1. The methodology referred to in Target 1 and explained further in the paper report refers to the use of reference conditions but does not explain what these reference conditions are. As a result, this methodology cannot be evaluated and is considered not adequate. No targets are provided for descriptor 4 in either the reporting sheets or the paper reports.;"- In the reporting sheet, targets are verbatim copies of the GES definitions
- In the paper report they are accompanied by specific and potentially measurable indicators
- Methodology entirely based on use of reference conditions which are not specified";1;Inadequate
Cyprus;D1;Consistency ;;"In the reporting sheets, the GES definition and the targets are the same. From the text in the paper report, it cannot be stated with certainty that Cyprus has actually defined GES. Furthermore, the GES definitions do not apply the Commission Decision criteria and indicators but the proposed targets for the period 2012-2018 as provided for in the paper report do use the Commission Decision. 

Considering that the paper report refers to proposed targets and the reporting sheets do not provide actual targets but copies of the GES definitions, it could be stated that Cyprus has not defined actual targets. In light of the fact that Cyprus considers both Descriptor 1 and Descriptor 6 to be at GES, it could be considered appropriate that the GES and targets in the reporting sheets refer to maintaining certain ecosystem characteristics. In general it can be said that Cyprus’ approach to the biodiversity descriptors is unclear and not fully explained in the paper reports, especially in regard to the targets.

Cyprus;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor level in the paper report. It has not reproduced this definition in the reporting sheets. The GES definition is copied from Annex I of the Directive. 

In the paper report, the criteria from the Commission Decision are mentioned as recommendations from the European Union (Commission Decision and JRC Task Group report on D10). It is not clear whether the Decision’s criteria have been adopted under the GES definition. The lack of further detail is motivated by the lack of data. A clear plan to address the data gap, except for a general statement on the need for monitoring programmes, has not been provided. Reference to UNEP MAP/POL documents is not made.

In the accompanying text of the GES definition, Cyprus provides a general definition of what it considers to be marine litter. Cyprus aims to reduce harm to the landscape, public safety, economic sectors and the ecosystem and includes the impact of entanglements from ghost nets and ingestion of microparticles on marine life and the impact of marine litter on tourism and fisheries. In contradiction to the latter, Cyprus states, without justification, that marine litter does not cause damage on marine animals and other marine organisms in Cyprus’ marine environment.  ";The GES definition is inadequate. Insufficient detail is provided. The socio-economic and ecological impact of marine litter is specified.;"- GES definition is a reproduction of Annex I MSFD

Cyprus;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor level in the paper report. The GES definition in the paper report closely matches the GES definition of Annex I of the Directive. In the reporting sheets, no GES definition is provided.

The indicators and criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision have not been included in the GES definition. Instead, Cyprus refers to the quantitative indicators that were recommended by the EU/ICES Task Group report on D11, which are different from the Commission Decision indicators and are therefore considered to be outdated. 

The lack of data to assess the current state on underwater noise is given as motivation for the limited elaboration of the GES definition. ";The GES definition of Cyprus for D11 is assessed as inadequate. Even though the limited information does not allow for a better elaboration of GES, the GES definition is still vague and only defined at the descriptor level. The indicators presented by Cyprus, which may be included in the GES definition (although this is not clear), are not the appropriate indicators from the Commission Decision and are considered to be outdated. ;"- GES definition is vague and only at the descriptor level

In the paper report, the initial assessment of Cyprus on underwater noise describes the sources of underwater noise qualitatively (commercial shipping, seismic exploration, sonar, acoustic deterrent devices, explosions and industrial activities and control). Cyprus states that the oil and gas industry as well as commercial shipping have increased noise levels by a factor of ten over a few decades and maintains that if nothing is done, the situation will deteriorate. 

As a consequence of a general lack of data, Cyprus is not able to assess the current status of their marine waters in relation to GES. Cyprus aims to collect the missing data before 2018.";The initial assessment of Cyprus for underwater noise is considered inadequate.

Cyprus;D11;Consistency ;;While Cyprus acknowledges in its limited initial assessment that the current situation may degrade if nothing is done, it has not set environmental targets yet to help achieve GES.

Cyprus;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 2 only at descriptor level. The GES definition simply reproduces the Directive definition in Annex I. The GES definition does not meet the minimum requirements (no further increase of NIS which has an adverse effect on the ecosystem, i.e. no new introductions of NIS, and where possible, no further spread of NIS). It does not provide any information on specific vectors or NIS. 

In addition, in the paper report, Cyprus comments on the lack of GES definition at criteria and indicator level. With regard to criterion 2.1 and indicator 2.1.1 (abundance and state characterisation), the lack of definition is due to the fragmentary nature of the available information. For criterion 2.2 (environmental impact), indicator 2.2.1 (ratio between NIS and native species) is not calculated while in relation to indicator 2.2.2 (impact of NIS), the impacts are not currently assessed directly.";GES definition is assessed as inadequate. GES is defined only at descriptor level and the GES definition is a mere copy of the Directive Annex I. Cyprus argues that GES cannot be defined at criteria and indicator level because of the lack of information. However, it should still be possible to define GES at criteria level as this does not necessarily depend on the availability of data, which would only play a role in the initial assessment and formulating targets. The minimum requirements ((no further increase of NIS which have an adverse effect on the ecosystem, i.e. no new introductions of NIS, and where possible no further spreading of them) are not reflected;"- Almost verbatim reproduction of Annex I MSFD

Cyprus;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"While the inventory of NIS in the reporting sheet includes only one NIS, Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea, the paper report indicates that, as of July 2009, 126 NIS were reported in Cypriot waters, 80 of which were established. These NIS are listed together with their status (invasive, established, casual, cryptogenic, questionable) and first year of record. Fifteen invasive species have been identified in Cypriot waters up to 2012, and the list is provided. It notes that in Cyprus the primary pathway for introduction of NIS is the practically passive transfer of Lessepsian migrants from the Indo-Pacific and the Red Sea through the Suez Canal into the Eastern Mediterranean. Shipping is also mentioned as the second vector of NIS. More detailed information on abundance, spatial distribution and impacts is provided in the paper report on some NIS: Siganus luridus and Siganus rivulatus, Lagocephalus sceleratus, Fistularia commersonii, Caulerpa racemosa, Cladophora spp.

The level of the pressure is considered as increasing and that it will increase up to 2024. A judgement on the level of impact is made (not good) but no trend is provided.

The judgement on the current status in relation to GES is made as part of the report on GES rather than in the initial assessment. Cyprus states that: ‘Due to the high uncertainty as to the impacts of widespread invasive alien species, and the highly invasive nature of the better studied species, the environmental status of Cyprus waters with regard to Descriptor 2 is determined at the level of the descriptor to be 0.5, i.e., Cyprus waters are not in GES with respect to Descriptor 2’ (see Section 2 on cross-cutting issues for an explanation of the determination of the environmental status). This assessment is made on the basis of expert opinion, taking into account the widespread presence of 15 invasive NIS and the high level of uncertainty as regard their impacts. It is only stated that the focus in the near-future to determine GES should lie on 15 IAS, since these species would cause the most adverse effects on the ecosystem. ";The initial assessment is considered as partially adequate. It appears relatively complete in the light of what can be expected for Descriptor 2. Cyprus has provided a list of invasive NIS and information on the level of pressure. It should be noted that Cyprus has made an effort to make a judgement on the current status in relation to GES. While this assessment is part of the section on GES when it would be expected as part of the initial assessment, it is still considered as ‘good practice’. However, this characterisation remains vague and the criteria on the basis of which this judgement has been done are not entirely clear. The assessment of impacts is limited. Cyprus notes knowledge and data gaps but there are no detailed plans on how to address those.;"- Provides an inventory of invasive NIS

Cyprus;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Cyprus has not set environmental targets and associated indicators for Descriptor 2.

This is justified by the lack of knowledge on abundance and temporal and spatial distribution of NIS and especially invasive ones in Cyprus waters. Cyprus indicates its intent to be in a position to quantitatively assess the status of the Cyprus marine waters in relation to invasive NIS in 2018 and to set ‘(semi)-quantitative’ targets for the period 2018-2024. However, Cyprus only indicates that the authorities are encouraged to pursue research opportunities, as these arise, to fill the knowledge gaps. The paper report refers to existing monitoring or data collection efforts which should be used to collect data that ‘may’ be used to estimate the associated indicators or any suitable proxies.

This justification for not determining targets and the plans to fill in the knowledge gaps are considered as too general and non-committal, often restricted to the collection of further data under existing efforts.";Not reported.;- Not reported;0;Not reported
Cyprus;D2;Consistency ;;While the assessment has identified particular species and vectors/pathways, the definition of GES remains very general and there is no specific environmental target for D2. Hence, the different pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 2 identified in the initial assessment are not covered. However, Cyprus recognises that the lack of specifications is linked to knowledge and data gaps and it proposes to address them in order to set more detailed GES and targets by 2018. However, while this introduces a certain degree of consistency, the level of detail provided in the initial assessment should enable more detailed definition of GES and the establishment of environmental targets at present. ;;;;
Cyprus;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The GES definition for Descriptor 3 has been defined at the descriptor, criteria and indicator level. In regard to criterion 3.1, Cyprus requires that no stock is exploited beyond safe biological limits and then refers to Fmsy and the catch/biomass index. The way condition (a) is phrased however could mean that it requires that no stock is exploited beyond the Fpa level rather than the Fmsy level. 

In regard to criterion 3.2, under condition (b), it is clearer that the SSB of stocks should be at a level capable of providing MSY or higher but it is not clear whether this is required for all stocks. 

Finally criterion 3.3 is defined at the criteria level and includes aspects of indicator 3.3.1. This criterion lacks thresholds and baselines but this is acceptable considering the level of development of this indicator. 

To be in line with the Commission Decision it should be clear that condition (a) actually requires all stocks to be exploited at Fmsy and condition b. that all stocks are either at a level capable of providing MSY or otherwise at least have SSBs above PA levels. ";The Cyprus GES definition is partially adequate. The GES definition applies Fmsy but from the definition it is not completely clear whether all stocks should be exploited at or below Fmsy levels. In regard to criterion 3.2 it is not clear whether condition (b) applies to all stocks.

Cyprus;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Cyprus’ initial assessment reports on the status of 11 stocks, four in relation to Fpa and Bpa levels and seven using expert judgement on the indicator trends. Four out of the seven stocks are considered within safe biological limits. All stocks reported on were demersal fish stocks. Pelagic stocks, shellfish and cephalopods were not reported on.  However, cephalopods are important stocks as Cyprus mentions that the most common species targeted are octopuses (cephalopods), which along with red mullets, picarel and bogue account for 40% of total catches (2008). Furthermore while no pelagic species contributes to more than 1% of the catch, the fact that Cyprus has a fishery fleet that targets mainly swordfish, albacore, bluefin tuna and other tuna species and corresponds to 2.1% of the total fishing fleet means that Pelagic species are relevant stocks for reporting on. Shellfish might not be relevant to Cypriot fisheries. 

In regard to fishing fleets passive gear vessels of less than 12 m, longliners, bottom trawlers and recreational fleets are described. With the exception of recreational fishing the landings of the fleets and the proportion of the total catch are provided. However it should be noted that the proportion of the catches reported in the reporting sheets only adds up to 90% of the total catch. 

The impacts from fisheries on seabed habitats, the water column and bycatch species are reported as being unknown.

Cyprus;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The Cyprus target for Descriptor 3 consists of two parts, first a close approximation of Descriptor 3 as provided in Annex I of the MSFD and then a reference to the use of relevant policy recommendations in the framework of the CFP.

While the first part of the target is a close approximation of the Descriptor 3 text of Annex I, it deviates in that it states that the populations of all commercially exploited fish and shellfish should approach safe biological limits but does not actually require all populations to be within safe biological limits, as the Annex I text does. Based on this condition the target is noncommittal and while it is stated as being a GES target it is not actually sufficient to ensure the achievement of GES by 2018 or 2020. Regarding the population age and size distribution it is uncertain whether this can be measured since there is currently no conclusive guidance on what constitutes a healthy stock in regard to Criterion 3.3. 

In order to achieve their target, Cyprus intends to follow all ICES, ICCAT and GFCM recommendations that are aimed at meeting the conditions in the first part of the target. In the paper report it is mentioned that if these recommendations are not sufficient to achieve the environmental targets, additional management measures might be needed. It is not specified what these measures should be, although several possibilities are stated";The environmental target defined by Cyprus to cover D3 is considered inadequate.

Cyprus;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor level in the reporting sheets. It is not clear what the GES definition for D5 is in the paper report since the structure of Cyprus reporting is confusing in terms of determining what is their definition of GES and what is the current assessment of Cyprus marine waters in comparison to this definition of GES. The paper report does not include a clear GES definition at descriptor or criteria/indicator levels; it includes a table with the aggregation methodology to assess the current status where one of the parameters is “deviations from reference conditions”, but it is not clear how this relates to the definition of GES. Thus, for this analysis, solely the definition in the reporting sheets was taken into account.

The definition of GES is a reformulation of the MSFD at descriptor level and none of the criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 5 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated into the definition. Consequently, no thresholds or reference values are provided.

Cyprus fails to state how the GES definition for the MSFD integrates or matches with the WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters, but it does report that judgement of the achievement (or otherwise) of MSFD GES thresholds has been possible in “specific cases” because of research and monitoring data collected to assess compliance with other EU Directives. It is not declared specifically whether or not MSFD GES thresholds are aligned with WFD norms, but based on comments dispersed throughout the accompanying text it appears that MSFD GES will be at least equivalent to WFD GES. No mention is made of an RSC/international/national approach, including that of UNEP MAP/MEDPOL. ";The GES definition of Cyprus for Descriptor 5 is considered as inadequate. The definition is a copy of the MSFD at descriptor level and does not cover any of the criteria and indicators of the 2010 Commission Decision. No thresholds or reference values have been provided in the GES definition. The definition is merely qualitative and not specific enough to know when GES will be achieved.

Cyprus;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"A partial assessment has been undertaken by Cyprus on the level of pressure and impact of eutrophication in their waters. The shortcomings in knowledge/information are highlighted and plans to undertake further research to fill the gaps are reported (including improved estimates of submarine groundwater inputs and Saharan dust deposition). Cypriot marine ecosystems appear to offer considerable resilience to the potentially high nutrient inputs from these and other (minor) sources, as evidenced by ultra-oligotrophic nutrient concentrations (often below limits of detection) and the good status of coastal waters in the Cyprus River Basin Management Plan.

The assessment covers both nitrogen and phosphorus – silicate is derived overwhelmingly from natural sources and not considered to be relevant. Organic inputs from human activities are not routinely measured and only in the case of aquaculture was an estimate of particulate organic material input made: 1300t in 2010, but land-derived organic inputs are of restricted use on their own. The ultraoligotrophic character of the assessment area is reflected in very low concentrations of organic material (measured in 2008), nitrogen and phosphorus. The Levantine Basin is considered to be one of the most oligotrophic ocean bodies in the world. The acknowledgement that groundwaters could be a substantial vector of entry for nutrient inputs is praiseworthy. Judgement on the level of impact appears to be reasonable. It is reported that less than 1% of the seabed and water column habitats are impacted by eutrophication and that the situation is stable. 

The conclusion that Cyprus’s marine waters are currently in GES appears to be realistic, but the level of pressure for phosphorus (the major limiting macronutrient) requires further evaluation. At present, only one source of phosphorus has been considered – treated wastewater. The identification of desalination plants as a eutrophication pressure can be considered unusual, since the wastewater produced from these contains only concentrated nutrients derived from seawater; desalination should not in itself add any additional nutrients (except perhaps through atmospheric deposition via the high energy demands of the desalination process).";The initial assessment of Cyprus for eutrophication is considered as adequate. The assessment includes loads and concentration of all the relevant nutrients and organic matter, and describes the main sources of eutrophication. Cyprus covered the impacts on both seabed and water column habitats. Trends, judgements and the proportion of the habitats impacted are also provided and reference is made to the Water Framework Directive monitoring and classifications.;"- Covers loads and concentration of all the relevant nutrients and organic matter

Cyprus;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Cyprus has defined one environmental target and associated indicators to address Descriptor 5. In the reporting sheets only the environmental target is provided but reference is made to two sub-targets and nine associated indicators, which can be found in the paper report. The structure of the Cypriot report is not entirely clear and consistent as the content of the reporting sheets and the content of the paper report are not the same, but rather complementary. For that reason the content of the reporting sheets and the paper report is analysed in conjunction. What Cyprus seems to consider to be sub-targets are understood to be the two threshold values “Divergence < 25% from reference conditions” and “Divergence < 50% from reference conditions” associated to the nine indicators. 

Based on information provided for the definition of GES and the initial assessment, the target, indicators and associated threshold values are specific with regard to impacts, measurable, and probably achievable and realistic, although it is not clear what the “reference conditions” are. Cyprus reports higher abundances of opportunistic macroalgae, including non-periodic blooms of Cladophora spp. at some areas where nutrient inputs occur, but there are no targets which focus more specifically on those areas and types of impact. The targets are directed at impacts rather than pressures, but not particularly focused on individual impacts; rather, on eutrophication as a multi-impact environmental issue. There is no focus on human activities which may contribute to eutrophication issues.

The environmental target appear to be sufficiently ambitious to reduce the pressure or impact to levels that will achieve GES since the initial assessment suggests that Cypriot marine waters are currently in GES with regard to Descriptor 5. The target and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 are consistent as a set, since the indicators results are used to calculate whether the targets have been achieved. There are no conflicts between the targets and indicators, but there may be with regard to which indicators represent which eutrophication criteria.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Cyprus for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The set of targets is specific, measurable but it is not clear if it is achievable and realistic, since it is not clear what the “reference conditions” are. The set of targets focus on impacts rather than pressures, but not specifically on individual impacts. It is sufficiently ambitious to achieve GES as it is reported that the Cypriot waters are already at GES.;"- The set of targets is specific and measurable but it is not clear if it is achievable and realistic

Cyprus;D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressure and its impacts is not entirely consistent with the Cypriot definition of GES. Even though the GES definition is very general, it focus only on impacts and bears no relationship to pressures, which have been covered in the initial assessment. Likewise, the targets cover all impacts, except for nutrient levels in marine waters - for which there is a valid explanation - but fail to address either the total eutrophication pressures, or any contributing individual pressure. The environmental targets simply define GES.

The targets defined by Cyprus will probably not lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/ impacts. Cyprus appears to have a good understanding of pressures, but it is unclear why river loads of nutrients/organic material have not been assessed, when submarine groundwater inputs are considered potentially important. It is also unclear whether the dominance of atmospheric deposition (notably particulate matter from Saharan dust storms) as a nutrient source is likely to contribute more or less as a proportion of the total nitrogen pressure than the total phosphorus pressure. As the marine system is phosphorus-limited, if the phosphorus input is mainly from transboundary sources, it is possible that attempts to further reduce anthropogenic phosphorus inputs could have very little effect on eutrophication impacts. Eutrophication relationships with climate change are clearly important. Because the targets are impact- rather than pressure-related, and are concerned with the achievement of GES, if GES is achieved, there will be no requirement to reduce pressures. However, if GES is not achieved, there will be a requirement to develop new (pressure-related) targets.";;;;
Cyprus;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 6 at descriptor and criteria level in the paper report and the reporting sheet. The GES definition as provided in the reporting sheets and as the introductory paragraph for Descriptor 6 in the paper report can be separated into two parts as is done in the paper report. The first part can be interpreted as being the GES definition while the second part can be interpreted as referring to the methodology used by Cyprus to determine the current state of their marine waters in relation to GES. The second part is not considered as part of the GES definition and therefore not assessed. 

The part that is considered the GES definition for Descriptor 6 does not follow the Commission Decision and deviates significantly from Descriptor 6 as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. The GES definition as provided is not specific to the sea-floor and benthic ecosystems and instead applies to the ecosystem in general. The criteria and indicators from the Commission Decision for Descriptor 6 have not been applied by Cyprus when defining Descriptor 6. The descriptor's objective is mainly to maintain the diversity and productivity of the ecosystem; it is relevant to note that Cyprus has concluded that in regard to Descriptor 6 the country is currently at GES. The GES definition as provided in the reporting sheets also states that this is the GES to be used in 2020, while the definition should not be time-specific.

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Inadequate, 1):

Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at descriptor level in the paper report and the reporting sheet. The Cypriot GES definition can be separated into two parts, the first part is very general, recalling that GES is to be achieved by 2020, while the second part is a verbatim reproduction of the GES definition as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. The criteria of the Commission Decision are addressed only insofar as they are covered by the general definition at descriptor level (e.g. abundance of species) but Cyprus does not specify them further. 

In the paper report the GES definition is explained in more detail by providing conclusions from various guidance documents such as those from the JRC and ICES, but Cyprus does not refer to other relevant EU legislation (Water Framework Directive, Habitats and Birds Directives) or to the ecosystem approach of UNEP/MAP.

Neither in the paper report or the reporting sheets does Cyprus provide a GES definition for Descriptor 1 that is specific to Cyprus waters. The GES definition as provided in the reporting sheets also states that this is the GES to be used in 2020 while the definition should not be time-specific. In the reporting sheet, Cyprus provides a long list of the ecosystem features covered by the GES definition, which includes a number of relevant seabed habitat types covering the main zones (shallow, littoral, shelf and marine coast and shelf) but includes only fish functional groups and none of the other species groups (e.g. birds or marine mammals).";The definition of GES for D6 is considered inadequate. The GES definition is not appropriate for Descriptor 6 of the MSFD and would have been more relevant for Descriptor 1.

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Adequate, 3):

Cyprus has carried out an initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage – the information is both qualitative and quantitative. Cyprus acknowledges that there is insufficient information available on the impacts caused by physical loss and physical damage, namely, the extent and status of biogenic substrates impacted as well as the indirect impact of the structures on and along the coastline. It is reported that a (semi-) quantitative assessment of the habitats impacted will be possible by 2018 and that further research opportunities will be explored.

Cyprus indicates that the construction, operation and maintenance of structures on and along the coastline are the main cause of both physical loss and physical damage. Although these cover less than 1% of the Cypriot marine waters, they occupy 7-9% of the area within 100m from the coastline. In the paper report, changes in siltation and selective extraction are also briefly referred to and the area affected by these is provided. No trends or conclusive judgements on the level of physical loss and physical damage are reported.

Although the data available on impacts is limited, Cyprus refers to the work carried out under the Water Framework Directive as a source of information on the condition and function of angiosperm, macroalgae and macrobenthic communities in Cypriot coastal waters. It is indicated that less than 1% of the seabed habitats is impacted. The current status of the Cypriot waters in relation to physical loss and physical pressure is considered good and the trend is stable.

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
Cyprus has carried out an initial assessment on both seabed and water column habitats. The assessment is mainly qualitative. In the reporting sheets, Cyprus reports all the information under predominant/special habitats covering the following: Water Column all, Seabed all, Posidonia Beds, Reefs, Sea Caves and Sandbanks. In the paper report, Cyprus reports on a series of special habitats, using as a reference the relevant Natura 2000 habitats, and has specific sections on phytoplankton, zooplankton, angiosperms, macroalgae and invertebrate bottom fauna communities. 

The information in the reporting sheets includes for each type of habitat a brief description of the habitat distribution, extent and condition. The current status as compared with the natural status is provided (always in line) as is the proportion of change per reference to this natural status (always less than 1%). Trends (stable in all cases) and judgements (always good) on the current status of the habitats are also provided for all habitats reported. The main pressures are only indicated in relation to the predominant habitats (physical loss and smothering). Principally in the paper report, the Habitats Directive, and in particular the habitats listed under this Directive, and UNEP/MED are systematically referred to; other international conventions (Berne, Barcelona) are also mentioned.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Cyprus;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Inadequate; 1):

The two targets provided by Cyprus in regard to biodiversity are verbatim copies of the GES definitions although Target 1 is developed a bit further. This second part of Target 1 starting with the text “quantitative target” refers to a methodology used by Cyprus to assess the current status of Cypriot marine waters in regard to GES and the proposed targets and associated indicators for the period of 2012 to 2018.

The methodology referred to in Target 1 is further explained in the paper report. This methodology sets as targets that univariate biotic indices and simple parameters where the observed variability is high should have a divergence from the reference conditions that is equal to or not greater than 50% and for multivariate biotic indices, qualitative indices and abiotic parameters, a divergence equal to or less than 25% should be achieved. It is stated that the quantitative targets most commonly relate to values from reference stations however it is not clarified in what way. It is also not clarified in the report from which reference conditions the divergence will be measured. Since the reference conditions are not specified, these targets cannot be properly evaluated.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of targets and indicators defined by Cyprus for Descriptors 1 and 6 are considered inadequate. The targets in the reporting sheet are verbatim reproductions of the GES definitions except for a small part of Target 1. The methodology referred to in Target 1 and explained further in the paper report refers to the use of reference conditions but does not explain what these reference conditions are. As a result, this methodology cannot be evaluated and is considered not adequate. No targets are provided for descriptor 4 in either the reporting sheets or the paper reports.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Cyprus;D6;Consistency ;;"In the reporting sheets, the GES definition and the targets are the same. From the text in the paper report, it cannot be stated with certainty that Cyprus has actually defined GES. Furthermore, the GES definitions do not apply the Commission Decision criteria and indicators but the proposed targets for the period 2012-2018 as provided for in the paper report do use the Commission Decision. 

Considering that the paper report refers to proposed targets and the reporting sheets do not provide actual targets but copies of the GES definitions, it could be stated that Cyprus has not defined actual targets. In light of the fact that Cyprus considers both Descriptor 1 and Descriptor 6 to be at GES, it could be considered appropriate that the GES and targets in the reporting sheets refer to maintaining certain ecosystem characteristics. In general it can be said that Cyprus’ approach to the biodiversity descriptors is unclear and not fully explained in the paper reports, especially in regard to the targets.

Cyprus;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor and criteria levels.  In the paper report Cyprus provides additional information on criterion 7.1 and indicator 7.1.1 but it is not completely clear if this text is considered part of the Cypriot GES. For this analysis, the definition of the reporting sheets was the one taken into account.

Only criterion 7.1 and indicator 7.1.1 of the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated in the GES definition. Cyprus justifies the lack of use of criterion 7.2 with the lack of knowledge on the relation between pressures and changes in habitats but does not propose any action to address this gap. There is a lack of specificity with regard to certain terms and no threshold values are provided. There is also no reference to the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters.";The GES definition of Cyprus for D7 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition is very close to the MSFD definition of D7 but covers only criterion 7.1 of the 2010 Commission Decision. There is no determination of the main terms (permanent, alterations) and only a spatial characterisation of the alterations addressed is given (no threshold values).

Cyprus;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Cyprus has carried out a partial assessment – mainly qualitative – on permanent hydrographical changes. The lack of a more complete assessment is justified by the fact that the impacts caused by this pressure are restricted to a “negligible fraction of the assessment area”. It is estimated that the area directly impacted by the pressure is < 1 % of coastal waters. The assessment covers only changes in thermal and salinity regimes. In relation to thermal regimes the power generation capacity and indicative estimates of cooling water usage for the main power plants of Cyprus is given. 

The current and projected (2020) volume of freshwater generation by desalination is provided in the report. A limited assessment on the impacts on macroalgae, based on literature from 1999, is also provided.

Cyprus;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor level in the paper report and the reporting sheet. The Cypriot GES definition reproduces verbatim the text of Annex I of the MSFD. 

In the accompanying text to the GES definition, Cyprus provides a general definition of what is meant by “contaminants” and “pollution effects” (direct and/or indirect impacts on the marine environment). But it does not specify which contaminants are covered in the GES definition and which pollution effects are considered. Considering the strong links between the initial assessment and the definition of GES, it can be assumed that the same substances and biological effects as those assessed under Article 8 are covered by the GES definition, but this is not included in the definition itself. 

In addition to these two definitions, Cyprus refers in the accompanying text to a number of “target levels” which are understood to mean “reference levels”. These cover the concentration of contaminants (8.1) and the effects of contaminants (8.2). They do not refer to internationally-agreed standards, such as the EU EQS or OSPAR’s EAC, they just mention that concentrations of contaminants in the three relevant matrices should be below “environmental target levels identified on the basis of ecotoxicological data” and that levels of pollution effects should be “below environmental target level representing harm at organism, population, community and ecosystem level”. These two definitions could match a number of internationally agreed standards, in particular the EQS and EAC. 

It should be noted that the EQS Directive is not even mentioned in the introduction chapter of the GES paper report in the list of national and EU legislation that Cyprus says were considered in order to ensure compatibility when determining GES. 

Cyprus adds a third condition that concentration of contaminants, and occurrence and severity of pollution effects should not be increasing. While this could be considered a good practice, as it ensures that pollution levels do not increase even if they remain below threshold values, it is not certain what the baseline for this third condition is and therefore it is not measurable as such. Presumably, the baseline is the current status. ";The definition of GES for D8 by Cyprus is considered inadequate. The definition in itself is a verbatim reproduction of the Annex I text, not further specified at criteria level and does not cover the minimum requirement, which is compliance with the EQS Directive. While the accompanying text provides a little more detail on the various aspects covered by the GES definition, it is still not specific regarding the reference levels/standards to be used to measure achievement of GES.;"- Verbatim reproduction of Annex I MSFD
- Does not include compliance with EQSD and does not explicitly state which standards should be used to assess if GES is achieved
- Effects of contaminants are not covered";1;Inadequate
Cyprus;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Cyprus did not report on contamination by hazardous substances in the reporting sheets. In the paper report, it provides a rather short assessment of the contamination of its marine waters by hazardous substances and a judgement on current status in relation to GES. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
It describes very briefly the main land- and sea-based sources of pollution by hazardous substances (wastewater treatment facilities, industries, shipping and agriculture). In terms of the substances assessed, the Cypriot assessment covers among others PCBs, HCB, DDE, DDT, lindane, anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene and TBT for the man-made substances and lead, cadmium, mercury, copper, zinc, nickel, chromium and iron for the heavy metals. 

No information is provided on input loads into the marine environment. 

For man-made substances, Cyprus only concludes that analyses have shown that concentrations in water, sediment and biota in coastal areas were mostly below or very close to the detection limit (only traces). For measurement in biota of synthetic substances, it is not clear what species have been used to make the measurements but it was made in the frame of MED POL (UNEP/MAP) monitoring programmes. For heavy metals, Cyprus describes in detail the conditions in which the samples were measured (in 2007-2008) and concludes that metal concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, Hg and Fe in water, biota and sediment were also detected at low levels. For biota, Cyprus measured contaminant concentrations in the red mullet species and compared them with “values […] enacted from the EU”, understood to be EU Regulation 1881/2006. For water and sediment, Cyprus does not explain which reference levels its measurements were compared to (e.g. EQS) but it mentions that the analyses were carried out as part of the Water Framework Directive monitoring programme. 

Cyprus did not make an assessment of biological effects on ecosystem components but mentions relatively high concentrations of TBT in one monitoring station and its potential impacts (with no more details) on sensitive marine organisms. No conclusion is drawn from this on impacts on ecosystem components in general. 

In terms of judgement in relation to GES, in its report on Good Environmental Status, Cyprus reproduces the conclusions of the initial assessment (low levels of concentrations of heavy metals and synthetic (organic) compounds) and concludes that according to the methodology it has put in place to quantify the current status in relation to GES, the value of Descriptor 8 was estimated at 1 and therefore that the marine waters of Cyprus are in GES with regards to Descriptor 8.

Cyprus expects this “excellent status” to be maintained considering that the dangerous substances have been banned since the 1970’s. 

Radionuclides
Cyprus provides a short description of the various sources of contamination by radioactive substances, the main ones being space and atmospheric deposition, marine sediments, radioactive effluents, nuclear weapon tests and leaks in nuclear power plants. This is a general statement not specific to Cyprus where there is no nuclear plant. 

The radioactive substances assessed by Cyprus include 137Cs and 40K, 241Am, 109Cd, 60Co, 54Mn and 65Zn and the measurements, made in water, sediment and biota (Mediterranean mussel) took place between 2004 and 2009. The results concluded that while the levels were higher in water and sediment than on beach sand and in biota, they are still considered very low, explained by Cyprus mineralogy and lack of nuclear plants. 

The judgement in relation to GES is the same as for synthetic and non-synthetic substances. The marine waters in Cyprus are considered to be at GES.

Acute pollution events
Cyprus makes a concise description of the main causes of pollution by petroleum hydrocarbons, the first of which being illegal discharges of oil at sea. Cyprus uses satellite information from the EU programme “Monitoring Illicit Discharges from Vessels (MIDIV)” dated 1999-2004 but for information on input loads, the data used by Cyprus dates back to the 1980’s and focuses on pelagic and beach-stranded tar. The conclusion from these dated results is that pollution was low at the time. Cyprus is confident that this will continue due to the various international conventions in place and the development of new techniques. 

Cyprus does evoke the potential problems related to offshore exploration platforms but provides a number of justifications as to why these should not cause problems, based on the Environmental Impact Assessment for Exploratory Drilling which was carried out in 2011 (CSA International 2011).";The initial assessment of contamination by hazardous substances of Cypriot marine waters is considered partially adequate. The information provided is often dated and incomplete with regard to the minimum requirements (no information on input loads and impacts on ecosystem components), the information on acute pollution events is particularly dated. However, Cyprus has made a particular effort, and developed a detailed (albeit unclear) methodology, to be able to judge current status in relation to GES.  ;"- Dated and incomplete information (no information on input loads and on ecosystem impacts)

Cyprus;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Cyprus has defined one environmental target in the reporting sheets to cover D8, however this target is considered to be a reproduction of the GES definition with the addition of a reference to two quantified indicators. The indicators and associated “target” (which are considered to be threshold values) have been reproduced here for the sake of completeness. The indicators developed relate to heavy metals and oil and oil-products and the threshold value set is a divergence of <25% from the reference conditions. While this is potentially measurable, there is no specification of what is meant with “reference conditions”, making it impossible to assess whether the target is realistic and achievable and whether it will allow for the maintenance of GES. Cyprus has set a timescale for the achievement of the target to December 2018.

In the accompanying text, in the paper report on targets, Cyprus mentions that since current status is considered to be already at GES, the only targets to be set are to monitor a number of substances (only heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons – monitoring of synthetic and radioactive substances is not considered necessary). For heavy metals, it also means ensuring that monitoring sites are located near pollution points. 
";The environmental target defined by Cyprus to cover D8 is considered inadequate. The target in the reporting sheet is a reproduction of the GES definition and only refers to the indicators and threshold values defined by Cyprus without providing them. The indicators and threshold values provided in the paper report are relevant but not enough to ensure that GES will be maintained. They do not cover all elements (e.g. synthetic substances, biological effects) and, without the specification of what is meant by “reference conditions”, it cannot be assessed whether they are realistic, achievable and sufficient to maintain GES. ;"- Target is a reproduction of GES definition with a number of indicators associated

Cyprus;D8;Consistency ;;"There is a lack of consistency in the Cypriot approach to contamination by hazardous substances in that the GES definition seems to cover biological effects; these have not been assessed under Article 8 and are not addressed by the environmental targets. Cyprus does not even mention the need to increase knowledge on this aspect. 

There is consistency in the substances assessed and covered by the environmental targets since the GES definition is in any case large enough to cover these. There is consistency in the fact that Cyprus considers its current status to be at GES already and therefore concludes that only monitoring targets should be defined. It is therefore not clear how the threshold value, defined through possible deviation from unspecified reference conditions, relates to this conclusion. ";;;;
Cyprus;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Cyprus has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor level. The GES definition is a verbatim reproduction of the text of Annex I of the MSFD. 

In addition, in the accompanying text to the GES definition, Cyprus mentions that a number of conditions should be taken into account when monitoring D9. These include the frequency that levels exceed the regulatory levels, the actual levels that have been detected, the number of contaminants for which exceeding levels have been detected in parallel and the origin of the contamination. These conditions reflect the criterion and indicators of the Commission Decision and the conclusions of the JRC report on D9. It is not, however stated that they are conditions for the achievement of GES.

Because of the nature of the GES definition in Annex I of the Directive, the GES definition of Cyprus is measurable and relatively specific since it refers to Community legislation, understood to mean Regulation 1881/2006. However, this is not clearly stated in the definition or in the accompanying text. 

No mention is made of the substances to be monitored and the species on which testing should be carried out. Because of the strong links between the initial assessment and the definition of GES, it could be assumed that the substances covered under Article 8 apply to Article 9 but this is not explicitly mentioned. ";The GES definition for D9 by Cyprus is considered to be partially adequate. The GES definition is only a reproduction of the Annex I definition and is not specified at criterion or indicator level. No clear mention is made of the substances addressed, the species covered or the reference levels to be used.

Cyprus;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The assessment of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption by hazardous substances is integrated into the general assessment of contamination of the marine environment (see D8 section). An assessment was made only for heavy metals. Concentrations of synthetic and radioactive substances were not measured in fish and shellfish. 

The fish species used for the assessment is the red mullet, in which levels of mercury, cadmium and lead were measured between 2004 and 2010, in the framework of a MED POL programme. Cyprus provides a graph showing the evolution of concentrations of mercury, cadmium and lead in three different sites (Lemesos, Larnaka and Pafos) between 2004 and 2010.

Overall, even if some concentrations increased locally, the levels remain below the thresholds as “enacted in EU legislation” (understood to refer to Regulation 1881/2006 although the reference to the Regulation is never provided). Cyprus makes an aggregated judgement that the country’s marine waters are in GES with regard to D9 for synthetic, non-synthetic and radioactive substances (the value of Descriptor 9 is estimated at 1), but it is not clear how it reaches that conclusion. Cyprus also concludes that “no exceeding frequency of contaminated fish caught in Cyprus marine environment with Hg, Cd and Pb was detected”. It is unclear what this statement means but it is understood to mean that regulatory levels were not exceeded (over the time period considered for the assessment) and therefore that the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded was null.  

Microbial pathogens
Cyprus has reported on microbial pathogens. It refers to quantitative analyses on the level of microbial pathogens in which it is concluded that the levels of microbial pathogens are acceptable. Cyprus also refers to the Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC) and notes that all the monitored coastal waters (112 for 2010) complied with both guide values and mandatory values. 

However, shellfish waters are not covered by the assessment, even though Cyprus has a shellfish aquaculture sector.  ";The initial assessment of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption by hazardous substances and by microbial pathogens carried out by Cyprus is considered to be inadequate. Despite the aggregated judgement in relation to GES, the assessment made by Cyprus is too incomplete to be considered even partially adequate. Only heavy metals have been considered and only one species has been sampled. The assessment of microbial pathogens contamination refers only to the Bathing Water Directive and not the Shellfish Water Directive, which is more of interest for D9.;"- Detailed methodology in place for assessment of current status but background information too limited and no direct reference to Regulation 1881/2006 
- Only heavy metals have been assessed 
- Only one species has been used for the sampling";1;Inadequate
Cyprus;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Cyprus has defined one environmental target to cover D9. Similarly to the other descriptors, the target is in two parts. The first part is a reproduction of the GES definition while the second part refers to the indicator defined and the “quantitative target” associated with this indicator (understood to be the threshold value). This threshold value is expressed in terms of possible deviation from reference conditions. The indicator is associated with “concentrations in fish and water samples”. 

It is not clear why the indicator refers to concentrations in fish and water samples when only fish samples are relevant. Water samples would be relevant if shellfish waters were considered but since these have not been assessed under Article 8 and are not covered in Article 9, it is unlikely that they would be covered under Article 10. 

Although it is measurable, it is not possible to know whether the target is realistic, achievable and sufficient to maintain GES since it is not specified what the “reference conditions” are. 

In the paper report on targets, Cyprus mentions that because the current status is already at GES, an appropriate target would be to continue monitoring heavy metals in fish samples (same species as the initial assessment and “other, popular to eat, fish species in Cyprus”, not further specified). Finally, Cyprus refers to the necessity to implement Regulation 1881/2006, which should allow for monitoring of heavy metals and a number of synthetic substances (POPs, PCBs, etc.) in cultured seafood (e.g. mussels). It is not clear how these two statements relate to the environmental target set by Cyprus for D9.";The target and associated indicator defined by Cyprus to cover D9 is considered inadequate.

There is also a lack of consistency with the fact that Cyprus mentions in the accompanying text to its GES definition the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded (and the other D9 indicators of the Commission Decision) but it does not integrate these in its initial assessment and does not mention these indicators in the environmental targets and indicators.

Denmark;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Denmark has defined its GES for Descriptor 1 at the criteria level. There are a number of inconsistencies between the definitions reported in the reporting sheet and those included in the paper report. The first GES statement is missing from the reporting sheet. Two definitions are missing for the coverage of criterion 1.6 in the reporting sheet. Finally, in the reporting sheet the references and the mention of the relevant indicators in brackets at the end of each definition are not always correct (e.g. Definition D1.2 corresponds to indicator D1.1.1 – distributional range, while D1.2 is actually covered by the definition D1.1 on species abundance and maintenance). As recommended by the disclaimer in the reporting sheet, the paper report is considered to be the formal document to be assessed when inconsistencies arise. The assessment was therefore made on the basis of the information provided in the paper report. 

All criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision are covered. GES is not defined at the descriptor level. Criteria 1.1 and 1.2 and criteria 1.4 and 1.5 are considered together.  

Species
In the paper report, Denmark introduces its chapter on the biodiversity descriptors by explaining that it has chosen to focus on a selection of species, which can be used as indicators of biodiversity. The criteria to select these species are the following:
-	Species that express most of the indicators
-	Species for which data has already been collected at national or international level to illustrate trends over time and ensure consistency with other countries
-	Species that have significant functional impact on the ecosystem
-	Species from the upper part of the ecosystem (top predators), and can therefore be assumed to be good indicators for the rest of the ecosystem.

From the targets, we can infer that the species selected by Denmark as indicator species include harbour seal, harbour porpoise, sandeel, divers, common scoter, long-tailed duck, common eider, macroalgae, horse mussel, Haploops. On this basis, the definitions for criteria 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 would therefore address only these species and not cover all species. From the list of indicator species, all species groups are covered by the GES definitions, albeit not in a comprehensive way, except for cephalopods. No justification is provided for the lack of coverage of cephalopods.

Overall, the definition of GES for species is quite complete in the sense that it addresses most of the indicators of the Commission Decision (development of the population, abundance and maintenance of reproductive capacity, natural distribution, population’s structure and health, reproduction and genetic variation). However, each GES statement in itself is rather general and there is no detail that specifies what is meant by general terms such as “maintained” and “safeguard”. The only definition which would be specific is the one stating that the natural distributional range of the species is not declining but even so, no baseline is specified to measure such decline (or lack thereof). The GES definition is geared towards achieving a functioning state but there is no reference or ambition stated about improving a degraded state. None of the definitions for any of the criteria recognise prevailing conditions as a factor in determining GES but rather relate to the functional ability of the ecosystem

No specific reference is made to listed or protected species. No reference is made to the Favourable Conservation Status of the Habitats and Birds Directive or to the Water Framework Directive. 

Habitats
In the paper report, Denmark introduces the section on habitats by referring to the Commission Decision and the requirement to set a number of habitat types for each region. Denmark then refers to the two most common habitat types, hard bottom and soft bottom. From this text and the targets defined below, it is presumed that the GES definitions for habitats refer to these two habitat types. However, it is not clearly stated by Denmark and the definitions are non-specific regarding which habitats are covered. The definition also addresses habitat of special biological interest but again it is not clear which ones these are. 

The GES definitions for habitats address both the abiotic and biotic aspects of the habitats. They cover the habitats’ distribution, extent and condition. In the definitions related to habitats’ condition, Denmark has introduced the notion of sustainable use of the habitats, which is not fully in line with the objective of the Directive to maintain the health of species and communities in their own right rather than to ensure sustainable use. The definitions are very general and there is no additional information (baselines, threshold values, references to existing legislation or agreements, lists of habitats or species) to further specify them. They are also, in some instances, non-committal (“may form the basis”).

Ecosystems
Denmark has defined GES for criterion 1.7 in relation to ecosystems. However the definition does not directly refer to the ecosystem structure or the composition and relative proportions of ecosystem components. The definition is general, looking at the marine environment as a whole rather than focusing on specific features, and covers only partially criterion 1.7.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 1 is considered partially adequate. GES is defined at criteria level and covers all of the criteria of the Commission Decision (although it can be argued that criterion 1.7 is only partly covered). All the definitions are very general and set a high level. No baselines have been defined which hinders the usefulness of definitions related to the maintenance of a status. In addition for species Denmark has chosen to select indicator species. The selection made by Denmark can be thought as a relevant indicator of ecosystem health however it is not enough to represent good environmental status of the full range of species/functional groups except for cephalopods. ;"- GES defined at criteria level and covers all criteria of the Commission Decision (but some only partly)
- General definitions at a high level

- Selection of indicator species does not cover the full range of species";2;Partially adequate
Denmark;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
The Danish assessment reports on three species groups (birds, mammals and fish) and more specifically on the following functional groups: inshore pelagic and benthic birds, offshore pelagic birds, toothed whales, seals, coastal, demersal and pelagic fish. Cephalopods have not been reported on and no justification is provided for this but it is in line with the fact that no GES has been defined for this species group. The exclusion of reptiles can be explained by the lack of these animals in Danish waters. Important functional groups which have not been reported on are elasmobranches and diadromous fish.

For each reported functional groups only a few species are mentioned and cannot be considered comprehensive or fully representative of the whole functional group. The main pressures on the groups have been reported. The most reported ones are physical loss and extraction of species. For all groups, Denmark has assessed that the current state of the groups’ condition is in line with natural conditions. However, the descriptions of the groups’ condition and relative abundance are extremely limited if not inexistent.

Denmark makes a judgement on the status of fish functional groups, in reference to Fmsy, which is in line with their GES definition. It also makes a positive judgement on the status of seals, indicating that the population is growing. The criteria used to make this judgement are not presented in the reporting sheet. 

Habitats
In both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, Denmark has reported using the MSFD classification of predominant habitat types. In particular, Denmark has reported on five shallow habitat types (coarse and mixed sediment, mud, rock and sand) and four shelf habitat types (coarse and mixed sediment, mud and rock). Littoral habitats types have not been reported and neither have water column habitat types. Denmark does not provide any justification for not reporting on littoral habitats. For ‘Reduced salinity waters’, Denmark states that the whole of the Danish waters can be considered as belonging to this habitat. This would constitute all the more reasons to report on this habitat type, which Denmark does not do in the reporting sheet. 

In addition to predominant habitat types, Denmark reports on a number of listed habitats from the Habitats Directive and the OSPAR Convention. In particular, Denmark reports on habitat type 1170 (reefs) and 1180 (submarine structures made by leaking gases) from the Habitats Directive and on Modiolus modiolus beds and Sea-pen and burrowing megafauna communities from the OSPAR Convention. In addition, for the North Sea, Denmark reports on important areas for sandeel and on Haploops community (which is being assessed to be included in the HELCOM Commission’s Red List of Habitats). It acknowledges that this was formerly a widespread habitat in the region, but is now in serious decline. 

No qualitative assessment is provided for any of the habitats although reference is made to existing HELCOM and OSPAR initiatives. In effect no judgement has been made on the status of habitats although it is explained that data is available from EUSeamap and national surveys, but the data is not presented in the reporting sheets.  Subsequently no trend in status has been provided either. 

In the paper report, Denmark reports quite extensively on plankton and benthic communities. However, this information is not reported in the reporting sheet, either in the habitats or in the species/functional groups section.

Ecosystems
Denmark has reported on several ecosystems in the reporting sheet: two for the North Sea (ecosystem of Kattegat and ecosystem of North Sea and Skagerrak) and one ecosystem for the Baltic Sea (ecosystem of Danish Straits and Western Baltic). To do these assessments, they have used the work done for the HELCOM HOLAS assessment and for the HARMONY project. Denmark reports that the main pressure on the three ecosystems is physical loss, and more particularly smothering. 

For each ecosystem, Denmark reports on the productivity and abundance on only a few key species (cod in the Kattegat and in the Danish Straits & Western Baltic and zooplankton in the North Sea & Skagerrak).Using the results from HARMONY and HELCOM HOLAS Denmark makes a negative judgement on the status of these three ecosystems (all three are in no-good status). ";The initial assessment carried out by Denmark on biological features is considered partially adequate. The assessment of habitat types refers to EUSeamap and national surveys but does not present the relevant results from these studies. Furthermore the species/functional groups are only described at a low level of detail. While the information presented in the reporting sheets is extremely limited, the consistency check with the paper report has shown that more information, and more quantified information, has been included in the paper report. It is still, however, limited to only a few habitats and species. In the reporting sheet, Denmark does not report any information or data gaps and the plans to address these.;"Features:
- Information is limited to a few habitats and species groups
- Judgements provided but only in some cases";2;Partially adequate
Denmark;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Denmark has defined 21 targets to cover D1. Only 20 targets are reported in the box above because one target (Target 31), on harbour porpoises, is reported under D4 rather than here (as is the case in the paper report). But it is noted that this target also addresses D1. The order of the targets presented above reflect the order in the paper report, however the association of the relevant indicator with the relevant target has been done on the basis of the reporting sheets. It should be noted that one indicator in the paper report has not been reported in the reporting sheet (“Launch of studies on how the management of mining and quarrying, and fishing can ensure environmental objectives for selected habitats”, p16). 

The targets defined by Denmark cover the three levels of biodiversity: species, habitats and ecosystem. They cover most of the criteria and some of the indicators of the Commission Decision but only for a number of specific species/habitats, in line with their GES definition. 

All the targets have associated indicators. Most of the targets are GES targets but six of them are interim targets. All but one target are state targets. The targets cover mammals, birds and seabed habitats. Many of the targets are very specific relating to one species or one group of species. Baselines for all but two of the targets are yet to be defined and the two baselines provided (for bird species) are based on modelled data.  Likewise no threshold values have been defined. In practice, the targets are realistic and measurable with clear associated indicators, although without a timeframe for achievement it is not possible to determine if they are achievable. Because they are not measurable, the targets could be considered as expressions of GES for specific species/habitats.

Only a limited number of targets are geared towards reducing levels of a specific pressure (on physical disturbance, extraction of sediments). No target addresses a specific human activity. 

The targets do not conflict but as a set are very specific towards individual species, species groups or habitats and do not cover all aspects of the marine features of the Danish marine waters. Target 12, which does cover all habitats (at least that is the assumption), is very general and only an interim target.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators covering D1 is considered partially adequate. The targets defined are specific in the sense that they focus on specific species or habitats. They are potentially measurable, with clear associated indicators but lack information on threshold values and baselines to be operational. In addition, the set of target does not cover all relevant aspects of the marine features of the Danish waters.  ;"- Specific targets focusing on a number of species/habitats 
- Coverage of the three levels of biodiversity: species, habitats and ecosystem 
- Potentially measurable but lack of definition of threshold values and baselines to be operational
- Not fully SMART";2;Partially adequate
Denmark;D1;Consistency ;;"The GES definitions and targets are not always consistent or complementary. As an example the GES for D4 states that the populations of top predators needs to be healthy, however one of the targets for D4 refers to the biomass of copepods and zooplankton which, while indirectly linked to top predators, does not seem particularly relevant to the GES of D4 as it is defined. The target however does make sense in the context of D4 from the Commission Decision referring to food webs. 

The selection of species used for the targets are dominated by top predators and are not backed up by targets and indicators for the communities and species which function as key prey species for these predators (e.g. schooling fish or filter-feeding zoonbenthos) . Thus the interpretation of trends in top predators and changes in the ecosystem will be difficult to assess as there will be little data to understand why changes in the trends of top predators might occur and importantly whether these are due to changes lower in the ecosystem or due to other causes (e.g. reduction in fertility due to pollutants, mortality as a result of being by-catch). 

The choice for the allocation of targets to the different descriptors is also not always clear. Certain targets which are used for D1 would also apply to D6. Furthermore the targets for D1 and D4 are defined in more detail than those for D6. 

It is not possible to comment on the achievability of GES through the targets as no threshold values, baselines or timescales are set for these ones. 

Lastly the initial assessment refers to certain specific habitat types and species such as Modiolus modiolus are indicated to have significantly decreased yet not targets address these specific ecosystem components which were once common for Danish waters. In general however, the assessment of habitats and species is relatively consistent with the specific habitats and species selected in the GES definitions and the targets.";;;;
Denmark;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Denmark has defined GES for D10 at descriptor level. There is a difference between the GES definition in the paper report and the reporting sheets. The GES definition in the paper report is more developed and has been used for the assessment of adequacy. 

The GES definition has included aspects of the descriptor as provided in annex I of the MSFD but does not use the criteria/indicators as provided in Commission Decision. Trends in marine litter are not referred to and no reference is made to litter at specific areas in the ecosystem (e.g. coast, seabed, water column). The GES definition specifies that marine litter should not have a detrimental impact on marine ecosystems and species but, in regard to species, no comment is made to suggest the use of indicator 10.2.1 dealing with the ingestion of marine litter. The reference to decomposition products of marine litter can be inferred as dealing with micro-particles. In addition, Denmark added elements not covered by the Commission Decision. These are related to the impact on maritime industry, including tourism and the marine-litter supported proliferation of invasive species. The sources of marine litter are not addressed. 

No specific threshold values or baselines are provided in the GES definition or the accompanying text. The GES definition is in agreement with the HELCOM 2010 Ministerial Declaration and goes even further.";The Danish GES definition is considered partially adequate. It is defined at descriptor level only. Reference is not made to the criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision.

Denmark;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Denmark reports not to have a systematic monitoring on marine litter. Data is reported based on beach cleaning and seabed trawling. Video records of the seabed showed mainly ghost nets. Data is also reported from the fishing for litter project. A qualitative analysis is made of the sources of marine litter. Micro-plastics have not been studied in the Danish marine waters. Data has not been reported on the impact of marine litter on marine life. No information is available on water column, water surface, habitats and ecosystem as a whole. Where data is available, the assessment is likely to be sound. 

The work done in the RSCs has also been reported on and the assessment compares Danish areas in the Baltic and North SEA to other areas using research projects such as the HOLAS and HARMONY cumulative impact assessment.

Denmark;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Denmark has reported three targets and six associated indicators. Target 43 is a litter reduction target while targets 41 and 42 are research targets. Target 42 is a research target specifically to collect the data required to reduce marine litter in the environment.  

Target 43 aims for a reduction in litter on beaches originating from beach visitors, the target however does not refer to specific methodologies used to monitor litter on beaches and there might be some issues differentiating litter from beach visitors and other sources. Target 43 is potentially measurable but it is not fully SMART considering the lack of threshold values and baseline. 

Target 41 is SMART but it is a monitoring target. Projects are on-going to measure sea-bed marine litter in sea-bed trawls. The associated indicator refers to the recently started monitoring of marine litter as by-catch in fishing. The experience is available or being developed to make this target realistic for seabed and water column marine litter. 

Target 42 is partially measurable and SMART but it is a research/data collection target. Overall the target aims to improve the knowledge base for setting reference values and determining concrete measures to reduce marine litter by 2020, which is line with the data gaps identified in the initial assessment. Four associated indicators are linked to this target; two indicators are measurable and already used in respectively Target 41 (namely the indicator on by-catch in fisheries) and Target 43 (monitoring of beach litter). Additionally, an indicator on stomach contents of beached northern fulmars is added, which is not measurable as no value is provided. The fourth indicator aims to develop methods for monitoring marine litter on the seabed and micro-plastics in the marine environment. The existence of a methodology (or not) is measurable and works towards the long term goal of quantifying marine litter in the environment. However it is not clear how this mixture of indicators will lead to the achievement of the target and how this target will lead to achieving GES.";The set of environment targets and associated indicators to cover D10 is considered to be inadequate. It is a consistent set of indicators and targets. However, only one target relates to reducing impacts, the other two targets are research and monitoring targets. No target on floating litter has been mentioned. There is no target on the impact of marine litter on marine life, even though the stomach content for northern fulmars is mentioned as an indicator, but only as part of Target 42, which aims to improve the knowledge base. It is not clear why the Denmark report mentions that no target could be set for the impact on marine life (10.2.1) due to insufficient knowledge. The lack of a target on micro-particles (10.1.3) is acceptable due to a limited understanding of this issue and a lack of assessment methodologies.;"- Targets are not fully SMART

Denmark;D10;Consistency ;;The Danish approach for Descriptor 10 lacks consistency. In the GES definition invasive species and socio-economic concerns are specifically mentioned while the targets do not address these aspects of the GES definition. The targets also do not address impacts of marine litter on the marine environment although it should be mentioned that more knowledge will be collected on litter ingested by fulmars. ;;;;
Denmark;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Denmark has provided a copy of the GES definition as it is provided in annex I of the MSFD and has not incorporated the criteria and indicators from Commission Decision in their GES definition. Despite what Denmark indicates in bracket, it is not considered that the GES definition for D11 cover criterion 11.1 and indicator 11.1.1.

With regards to indicator 11.1.1, it is not clear why this indicator has not been included. The lack of definition for indicator 11.1.1 in the GES definition is not in line with guidance from the Commission. No justification is provided by Denmark for this gap. 

Denmark provides a justification for not including criteria 11.2 (and therefore indicator 11.2.1). However, it has to be pointed out that indicator 11.2.1 is designed to document relevant signature frequencies of shipping and not the whole band of frequencies covered by shipping noise due to practical reasons. The justification that some marine mammals are not too sensitive to these bands (they are certainly sensitive to the higher frequencies) is therefore an incorrect reason for not using this indicator. Documenting trends in the lower frequencies is telling us a lot of the overall trend covering the higher frequencies as well. 

It has to be further noted that marine life not only covers mammals but also fish that are very sensitive in the lower frequencies. Furthermore, the assumption made by Denmark that the frequency bands as defined by the Commission Decision do not travel well in Danish waters is only partly true. In waters exceeding 6 metres depths, the requested frequencies transmit well enough, covering most of the habitat of sensitive marine life. ";The GES definition is considered inadequate. The justification for not using indicator 11.2.1 is not correct considering the conceptual basis of the indicator and indicator 11.1.1 has not been applied or discussed.

Denmark does mention that it participates in the BIAS project that aims at measurements and modelling of a Baltic soundscape including Danish Waters but does not present data from this project. No specific research project is mentioned for the North Sea. No specific assessments on noise have been done for the Baltic and North Sea, instead the same information is provided for both regions in the reporting sheets.";The Danish initial assessment on underwater noise is considered inadequate The list of activities relevant to indicator 11.1.1 and 11.2.1 is adequate.

Denmark;D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Denmark has set one target with two associated indicators to address underwater noise. The target and associated indicators defined relate to indicator 11.1.1 of the Commission Decision but they do not address indicator 11.2.1. The target is potentially measurable through the associated indicators but there is a lack of threshold values and baselines to make these operational.

The target for indicator 11.1.1 is sufficient if it intends to follow the guidelines in the TSGN report. The associated indicator for the registration of the number of days with impulsive sounds might miss the dates when these events occur which is necessary to know whether these activities occur during the periods of the year when impacts are minimized. 

As mentioned, there is no target for indicator 11.2.1 but it is mentioned that ambient noise will be documented as part of the BIAS project. ";The targets are considered partially adequate. The target and associated indicators address impulsive sounds, in line with the Commission Decision. They lack specific details that would make the target SMART and would not be enough to achieve GES, since it does not include ambient noise. However, Denmark mentions that ambient noise will be recorded as part of a large scale project with Danish contribution, which will contribute to building up the knowledge base on noise.;"- Target and associated indicators are potentially measurable but lack threshold values to make them operational

Denmark;D11;Consistency ;;"The Danish report implies that indicator 11.1.1 is covered in the GES. This is however not reflected in the actual GES definition, which is a copy of the descriptor in Annex I of the MSFD. 

The initial assessment deals with both impulsive and ambient noise while Denmark has only set a target for impulsive noise and the GES is implied to address only impulsive noise at this moment. The Danish report therefore has a number of inconsistencies which need to be addressed.

The target and associated indicators defined by Denmark relate to indicator 11.1.1 of the Commission Decision but do not cover 11.2.1, which is consistent with the fact that Denmark considers its GES definition to cover 11.1.1. ";;;;
Denmark;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The definition of GES for Descriptor 2 applies to both the Baltic Sea and the Greater North Sea sub-regions. The definition is set at criteria level, but not at descriptor or indicator levels. The same and single definition is said to cover all GES criteria. However, the definition is extremely general and is a close approximation of the definition of Annex I of the Directive. While it aims at avoiding ‘unacceptable direct or indirect effects’, the definition does not mention vectors, pathways although they would be implicitly covered. It covers invasive NIS in general both existing NIS and new introductions. However, these different aspects could have been more specifically addressed in the GES definition.

It only covers invasive NIS which would only relate to criteria 2.2 (environmental impact of invasive non-indigenous species) and, in a very partial and indirect way, criteria 2.1 (abundance and state characterisation of non-indigenous species, in particular invasive species) as NIS in general are not mentioned in the definition.  

The definition of GES does not clearly reflect the minimum requirements ‘no further increase of NIS which have an adverse effect on the ecosystem’. It does not include any baseline, threshold or reference condition. No indication on further development status is given in the reporting sheet. The GES definition as set by Denmark does not specifically include the current pressure of NIS and the reduction of this already existing pressure. 

The GES definition is not specific enough to judge whether GES has been achieved. In particular, it is not clear what would be considered as ‘unacceptable effects’ and this is not further specified in targets and associated indicators. ";The GES definition for D2 is considered as inadequate. GES is set only at indicator level and only partly, and is actually a close approximation of the GES definition as per Annex I of the MSFD.

Denmark;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Denmark reported 40 NIS for the Greater North Sea and 23 for the Baltic Sea. However, Denmark notes that there is no systematic registration of introduced species. When introduced species have been identified through studies, this includes the geographical area concerned. Many of the introduced species are not considered invasive.

The main causes for the pressure are identified as shipping and aquaculture and other human activities, including directly introduced species such as sea grass (Spartina angelica) or species introduced via the movement of offshore platforms, stone and gravel, private yachts, fishing tools. Denmark notes the lack of systematic assessment of the importance of ‘other human activities’. No ranking of the causes is provided in the reporting sheets. However, the paper report presents quite detailed information on the main vectors and pathways, including their share in the spreading of NIS.

Denmark has not provided an assessment of the level of impacts of the pressure on the water column, the seabed habitats or the functional groups and provides only a very general qualitative description. There is no judgement on the pressure trend and current status in relation to GES.

In terms of information gaps and plans to address them, Denmark indicates that systematic monitoring activities need to be established albeit without further specification. The main knowledge gaps are linked to harbours and the assessment of the impact of introduced species. ";The initial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered partially adequate for both Danish sub-regions covered by the assessment. Denmark has provided a list of NIS while recognising that all species are not identified. The main vectors are identified. There could have been a qualitative assessment of impacts but this is lacking. Impact, level of and trend in pressure in different habitats has not been assessed. From the assessment it cannot be concluded whether the already present NIS cause any sort of pressure on the ecosystem. Gaps in knowledge are broadly identified and addressed in a general way.;"- Inventory of NIS provided

Denmark;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"For both marine sub-regions, two interim targets have been set with associated indicators common to both targets. There are both pressure related targets and address the main sources of pressure, shipping, and aquaculture and fishery and are formulated in a similar way ‘efforts are being made to reduce the transport of NIS’.

Denmark relates both targets to ‘indicator 2.1.1’ of the Commission Decision (Trends in abundance, temporal occurrence and spatial distribution in the wild of non-indigenous species, particularly invasive non-indigenous species, notably in risk areas, in relation to the main vectors and pathways of spreading of such species), while the remaining aspects of indicator 2.1.1 is covered by the first associated indicator, and the other associated indicators reflect indicators 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 from the Commission Decision. However, this is done in a less specific way. While the Commission Decision refers in relation to the ratio between invasive species and native species to some well-studied taxonomic groups (e.g. fish, macroalgae, molluscs) that may provide a measure of change in species composition (e.g. further to the displacement of native species), the Danish indicator mentions ‘selected species groups’ without further indication as to which groups should be monitored. 

The targets are not specific or measurable as it is not clear which effort and how extensive it should be. In addition, they are not bound by any timeframe. There is no threshold values or baseline although the reporting sheets indicate that they will be identified/determined but without further specification as to when, how and who is responsible.

The targets are clearly targeted towards controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved. They appear easy to achieve since making a very limited effort would already mean that the target is achieved. However, it lacks specificity and ambition ";This set of two general targets is considered as inadequate to achieve GES, which is itself defined in a rather vague way. The targets relate directly to a reduction in the identified pressures but without any specification. They are not SMART and lack ambition. ;"- Targets relate directly to a reduction in the identified pressures but without any specification

Denmark;D2;Consistency ;;"GES is determined as an ecosystem state in which the presence of NIS do no result in unacceptable effects, however from the initial assessment it cannot be concluded whether NIS in the present state already result in unacceptable effects. So initial assessment and GES cannot easily be linked with each other, and is therefore concluded to be not consistent. 

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 2 cover all the different pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 2 identified in the initial assessment. Targets are very general, but the associated indicators cover most different pressures and impacts. Since the initial assessment is limited, it is all covered by targets and indicators. 

The targets and associated indicators relate to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts. However, no target for the reduction of the current pressure and impact is formulated.

For the North Sea 14 stocks have been reported on while for the Baltic 6 stocks have been reported on. While fewer stocks have been reported on for the Baltic, these are representative of Baltic fisheries as herring, sprat, cod and flounder each reported on by Denmark represent about 90% of the total fish catch (tonnes) in the Baltic. The stocks have been assessed for several regions the North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat, Danish Belt Sea and the Eastern (Danish) Baltic Sea. Several stocks are assessed both at good and not good status in relation to the BMSY-trigger or Bpa reference points, depending on the area where the stock is being exploited. The GES status for the Baltic has been identified as not being at good status while for the North Sea no judgement has been made.

Impacts on mussels have not been included in the assessment as shellfisheries are included in the WFD.

Furthermore the associated indicator for Target 14 mentions only biomass computations for cod, herring, sandeel and European plaice while the initial assessment mentions considerably more commercially exploited stocks.

Target 14 might imply that stocks should be at a magnitude reflecting SSBmsy, however the “(Bpa)” portion might imply that stocks should be at SSBpa which is the same as for Target 30 which would mean that they are essentially the same.";;;;
Denmark;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Denmark has defined GES for Descriptor 4 at the criteria level. There are no inconsistencies between the definitions reported in the paper report and the definitions in the reporting sheet. 

The first GES statement is rather general and covers a number of species (as implied in the sentence “key predator stocks”). As for D1, these species are not specified in the accompanying text to Descriptor 4 in the paper report although it refers to marine mammals and plankton as good indicators. From the targets for D4, we can infer that the species covered include the common seals, harbour seals, cod and saithe, copepods and mesozooplankton, harbour porpoise, plankton. Again, the lack of specificity of the GES definition itself means that there is no clarity as to which species are addressed in the GES definition. The statement can be considered to cover the three criteria of the Commission Decision for D4.

The second statement focuses specifically on harbour porpoise. It is the same definition as used for criterion 1.1. It is not suggested that this species is used as a surrogate for all species.

The species selected by the targets cover all trophic levels and together with the harbour porpoise are appropriate indicators of changes in food webs. However they cannot be considered to cover appropriately the whole of the food web or ecosystem health.  

The definitions are general and there is no specification of what is meant with terms such as “maintain” and “safeguard”. No baseline, threshold value or trend is provided to measure achievement of GES.

In the paper report, Denmark mentions that indicators for the treatment of food webs are not well developed and that there is a need for further technical development to produce useful indicators.

Ecosystem
Denmark has defined GES for criterion 1.7 in relation to ecosystems. However the definition does not directly refer to the ecosystem structure or the composition and relative proportions of ecosystem components. The definition is general, looking at the marine environment as a whole rather than focusing on specific features, and covers only partially criterion 1.7.";Taking into account that D4 requires unfamiliar assessment approaches, the definition of GES for Descriptor 4 is considered as partially adequate.

Ecosystems
Denmark has reported on several ecosystems in the reporting sheet: two for the North Sea (ecosystem of Kattegat and ecosystem of North Sea and Skagerrak) and one ecosystem for the Baltic Sea (ecosystem of Danish Straits and Western Baltic). To do these assessments, they have used the work done for the HELCOM HOLAS assessment and for the HARMONY project. Denmark reports that the main pressure on the three ecosystems is physical loss, and more particularly smothering. 

For each ecosystem, Denmark reports on the productivity and abundance on only a few key species (cod in the Kattegat and in the Danish Straits & Western Baltic and zooplankton in the North Sea & Skagerrak).Using the results from HARMONY and HELCOM HOLAS Denmark makes a negative judgement on the status of these three ecosystems (all three are in no-good status). ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Denmark;D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Denmark has defined five targets to cover D4, each of them associated with an indicator. One target has not been reported in the reporting sheet on the occurrence and biomass of plankton. Four out of five targets are state targets and Target 31, on by-catch of porpoise, is an impact target, indirectly addressing a specific human activity (fisheries).  

All five targets are very specific, relating to one species or one group of species. Baselines need to be defined for all five targets and threshold values have not been reported either. In practice, the targets are potentially measurable with clear associated indicators and realistic, although without a timeframe for achievement it is not possible to determine if they are achievable.  The lack of baselines and threshold values means that they are not fully operational yet. Target 18 might also be an issue in case of the North Sea as the biomass of copepod communities there as stated in the initial assessment have significantly decreased over the past 25 years (halved). 

Targets 15, 16, 17 and 18 can all be considered as reflecting the productivity and function of the food webs. Target 31 to reduce the by-catch of harbour porpoises can be considered a measure to ensure that their role in the foodweb is not compromised. The targets as a set reflect both the ecosystem at the low trophic level (target 18) and high trophic level (15, 16). However they cannot be considered to adequately cover the foodweb as a whole. For example, harbour seals are diet generalists who will target a wide variety of prey species while dietary specialists might be affected by the depletion of specific prey species. In general the targets do not take into account specific predator prey processes which underlie the foodweb. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators covering D4 is considered partially adequate. The targets can be considered as reflecting the health of the foodweb at the lower and higher level. However the targets are very species oriented which is not sufficient to measure performance of the foodweb in a comprehensive fashion. Furthermore the targets as they are currently defined are not fully operational.;"- Targets are potentially measurable but they lack attributes to make them SMART (threshold values and baselines)
- Too species-oriented, do not cover the foodweb comprehensively";2;Partially adequate
Denmark;D4;Consistency ;;"The GES definitions and targets are not always consistent or complementary. As an example the GES for D4 states that the populations of top predators needs to be healthy, however one of the targets for D4 refers to the biomass of copepods and zooplankton which, while indirectly linked to top predators, does not seem particularly relevant to the GES of D4 as it is defined. The target however does make sense in the context of D4 from the Commission Decision referring to food webs. 

The selection of species used for the targets are dominated by top predators and are not backed up by targets and indicators for the communities and species which function as key prey species for these predators (e.g. schooling fish or filter-feeding zoonbenthos) . Thus the interpretation of trends in top predators and changes in the ecosystem will be difficult to assess as there will be little data to understand why changes in the trends of top predators might occur and importantly whether these are due to changes lower in the ecosystem or due to other causes (e.g. reduction in fertility due to pollutants, mortality as a result of being by-catch). 

The choice for the allocation of targets to the different descriptors is also not always clear. Certain targets which are used for D1 would also apply to D6. Furthermore the targets for D1 and D4 are defined in more detail than those for D6. 

It is not possible to comment on the achievability of GES through the targets as no threshold values, baselines or timescales are set for these ones. 

Lastly the initial assessment refers to certain specific habitat types and species such as Modiolus modiolus are indicated to have significantly decreased yet not targets address these specific ecosystem components which were once common for Danish waters. In general however, the assessment of habitats and species is relatively consistent with the specific habitats and species selected in the GES definitions and the targets.";;;;
Denmark;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The GES definition for Descriptor 5 applies to all Danish marine waters. Denmark has defined GES at criteria/indicator level. The definitions of GES for Descriptor 5 are different in the reporting sheet and the paper report. In the paper report, an additional definition is reported for what Denmark considers as “state” indicators. While in the reporting sheet, the reference for each GES definition is the criterion reference (e.g. 5.1), the definition actually addresses one indicator under these criteria (e.g. 5.1.1 only). 
Therefore the GES definitions for D5 in the reporting sheet do not address indicators 5.1.2, 5.2.1, 5.2.3, 5.2.4 and 5.3.1. In the paper report, they are partially addressed through the single definition “nutrient concentrations do not cause unwanted changes in biomass, density and composition of the marine flora” in chapter 2 of the report. 

It can therefore be considered that the GES definition for Denmark covers all three criteria but it cannot be stated that it covers all indicators as the definition for indicators 5.1.2, 5.2.1, 5.2.3, 5.2.4 and 5.3.1 is very general. The only indicator not directly referred to in the reporting sheet or the paper report is indicator 5.1.2. Denmark explains that while there is a need for further development of GES characteristics for this indicator, it is nitrogen that is primarily limiting algal production in the Danish area and should therefore be primarily targeted.

The accompanying text to the GES definitions in the paper report provides general information on what the challenges are in relation to nutrient levels (5.1), and direct and indirect effects (5.2 and 5.3) and mentions what the specific challenges for each marine region (North Sea and Baltic Sea). For nutrient levels, the text also explains the relation between MSFD GES and the objectives of the WFD.

None of the GES definitions are directly quantified. The definition for indicator 5.1.1 refers directly to the WFD but in a rather unspecific manner (“level of protection […] as a result of the WFD”). From the definition and the accompanying text, it can be extrapolated that the GES definition for indicator 5.1.1 has been matched to the WFD normative for nutrient concentrations in coastal waters and that it applies to coastal and offshore waters. The other two definitions are even more general. No threshold values or baselines are specified in the reporting sheet or the paper report. ";The GES definition of Denmark for D5 is assessed as inadequate. The definition of GES is not a copy of the MSFD, but rather a reformulation of three of the eutrophication indicators laid out in the Commission Decision. In the light of the accompanying text, it can be extrapolated that the GES definitions are matched to WFD normative definitions of GES but they are really unspecific with regard to threshold values and baselines and use general terms such as “sufficient” or “adversely affect”. ;"- GES definition cover all the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision

Denmark;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"North Sea
Denmark has carried out an initial assessment on the level of pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the North Sea, presenting qualitative and quantitative information. Loads of all relevant nutrients and organic matter are quantified (N and P), trends are assessed and the proportion of the area affected is indicated. Transboundary inputs of nutrients and organic matter are expressly mentioned and agriculture, forestry, industry and urban discharges are indicated as the main causes of eutrophication. Coastal areas are described as problematic, while the Danish parts of the open North Sea and Skagerrak are said to be in good status. Denmark makes an aggregated judgement on the current level of eutrophication in the North Sea area (using WFD threshold value), indicating that GES has not been achieved.  All impacts are considered in terms of nutrient concentrations (not organic enrichment, but dissolved oxygen status is included) and water transparency. Impacts on both pelagic and benthic communities are included, as are trends – the situation is improving with regard to both pressures and impacts. However, it is recognized that problems still exist and that GES is probably not being achieved at present.

Baltic Sea
The initial assessment on the level of pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea includes qualitative and quantitative information. The assessment covers all relevant nutrients (N and P) in terms of loads, trends and impacts. Organic matter is included in terms of loads and dissolved oxygen status. All relevant sources of nutrients appear to be covered - agriculture, forestry, industry and urban discharges are indicates as the main causes of eutrophication - and the whole geographical area has been considered in the assessment. The whole Danish marine area in the Baltic region is said to be subject to nutrient and organic enrichment. Judgments (using the WFD threshold values) are made mentioning that there have been major improvements since 1990, but further improvement still required and thus GES is not achieved. All impacts are considered in terms of nutrient concentrations (not organic enrichment, but dissolved oxygen status is included) and water transparency.

Denmark;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Denmark has defined 12 targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 5 in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in the reporting sheets. The targets are the same as in the paper report. In the reporting sheets, Denmark has split its targets covering altogether the Kattegat, Øresund, the Danish Straits and the waters around Bornholm (targets 33 and 35), into two targets covering Kattegat on the one hand and the other areas on the other hand (reported under the Baltic reporting sheets). Denmark has also split the target for indicator 5.3.1 on perennial macroalgae and seagrasses into two targets (22 and 23) in the reporting sheets.

All of the proposed targets contribute to the overall definition of GES for D5. The targets cover all Commission Decision indicators apart from nutrient ratios (indicator 5.1.2). The targets are all highly specific with regards to individual impacts of eutrophication, but not to controlling individual pressures, or human activities which are preventing GES from being achieved. The approach allows Denmark to most pragmatically tackle those individual pressures which contribute the greatest contribution to total/overall pressures or those which can most cost-effectively be tackled (€/tonne of nutrient and/or organic matter input reduction) to reduce the level of impact. They are all specific and potentially measureable, and because they are not time-bound they are realistic and ultimately achievable, albeit possibly/probably not by 2020. Since the targets effectively define GES (impact-wise), their achievement will automatically result in GES being achieved.

However, direct quantitative thresholds have been set for only two targets at present (23 and 35) and the associated indicators are often not specific enough to determine when the targets have been achieved, e.g. the indicator for nutrient concentrations is total nitrogen, but it is not specified whether the indicator is a mean, geometric mean, etc. value, nor whether the assessment period is seasonal (e.g. winter), annual or longer-term. For Target 23, no indicator is provided, although one appears to have been developed for WFD assessment purposes. From the target itself, the depth of colonisation of seagrasses appears to be the indicator. For water transparency (Target 34), no explanation is provided to the basis of the methodology used for assessment purposes, e.g. Secchi depth, depth of the euphotic zone (assumed to be 1% of surface light (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR = 400-700 nm) penetration, or even the depth of colonisation of macrophytobenthos. Two targets (33 and 52) use total nitrogen concentrations as the indicator, but these targets also apply to different areas.

Overall, the set of targets is considered as consistent, with some reservations. Targets 20 and 22 both rely on macroalgal indices for their assessment, but it is not clear whether the same index is to be used for both targets or different indices for the two targets. If it is the same index, it is not clear whether the same threshold value will apply to both targets, or different thresholds will be established for the two targets. In addition, targets 23 and 34 may conflict with each other, but this is not clear. The former target refers to WFD environmental targets for depth distribution of eelgrass, which will depend largely on water transparency, while the latter refers to water transparency when phytoplankton biomass is low enough to achieve GES. Thus, two transparency-based indicators may be established, with conflicting thresholds. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Denmark for D5 is assessed as partially adequate.  They are all specific, potentially measureable, realistic and ultimately achievable, but probably not by 2020. Since the targets effectively define GES, their achievement will automatically result in GES being achieved. The targets are all highly specific with regards to individual impacts of eutrophication, but not to controlling individual pressures, or human activities which are preventing GES from being achieved. In addition the targets are not considered to be completely consistent as set.;"- Targets are SMART (although probably not achievable by 2020)
- Highly specific with regards to individual impacts
- Not completely consistent";2;Partially adequate
Denmark;D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of eutrophication and its impacts in Danish marine waters is considered to be consistent with the definition of GES. Total pressures are quantified, but a breakdown of these into individual pressures (undertaken to some extent in discussions on the relative importance of transboundary marine inputs and atmospheric deposition) would have been useful. Individual impacts are described in detail and the whole geographical area is assessed – frankly and openly, for which Denmark should be congratulated. The definition of GES (and the targets) mirrors the impacts discussed in the pressure-impact analysis.

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 covers all the different impacts (albeit that quantitative thresholds have still to be set) related to Descriptor 5 identified in the initial assessment but not all the pressures. All impacts are described in detail, including those where resilience has been demonstrated in response to increased pressure, but some of the indicators require a greater level of clarification/precision and quantification. Improved knowledge of pressures with regard to dissolved oxygen status would be useful, e.g. the relative contributions to the latter from phytoplankton and terrestrial allochthanous inputs.

The targets are all impact-related and Danish marine waters are considered to not yet be in GES, the achievement of which will require pressure reduction. It is considered that the set of targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 sufficient to achieve GES, but only after the indicators have been made more specific and thresholds have been established for them all. ";;;;
Denmark;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Denmark has defined GES for Descriptor 6 at the criteria level in both the paper report and the reporting sheet. There are no inconsistencies between the paper report and the reporting sheet. The definition at criteria level effectively covers the two criteria of the Commission Decision on physical damage and the condition of the benthic community. 

The first part of the definition refers to biogenic substrate but does not specify which ones exactly (and which other sea-floor substrates) are addressed. The second part of the definition, on ecological function, is equally unspecific and with no specification of threshold or standards, it is not clear what is meant with “generally demonstrate”. There is no reference to the Water Framework Directive indicators (relevant for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.2.2).

No baselines are mentioned although reference is made to achieving a ‘natural diversity and productivity’ which could be considered a reference condition. There is therefore an ambition to achieve a reference state. Although no specific mention is made to improve quality, this might be considered implicit in achieving the reference state. There is no mention of the use of the WFD principle of ‘reference condition plus acceptable deviation’. 

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
In the paper report, Denmark introduces the section on habitats by referring to the Commission Decision and the requirement to set a number of habitat types for each region. Denmark then refers to the two most common habitat types, hard bottom and soft bottom. From this text and the targets defined below, it is presumed that the GES definitions for habitats refer to these two habitat types. However, it is not clearly stated by Denmark and the definitions are non-specific regarding which habitats are covered. The definition also addresses habitat of special biological interest but again it is not clear which ones these are. 

The GES definitions for habitats address both the abiotic and biotic aspects of the habitats. They cover the habitats’ distribution, extent and condition. In the definitions related to habitats’ condition, Denmark has introduced the notion of sustainable use of the habitats, which is not fully in line with the objective of the Directive to maintain the health of species and communities in their own right rather than to ensure sustainable use. The definitions are very general and there is no additional information (baselines, threshold values, references to existing legislation or agreements, lists of habitats or species) to further specify them. They are also, in some instances, non-committal (“may form the basis”).";The definition of GES for Descriptor 6 is considered as inadequate. The definitions are very general and lack specific details to make them measurable.  Considering the state of knowledge about the condition of the benthic community in Europe, more details could have been expected (e.g. used of WFD indicators).;"- Definition at criteria level covering all criteria

Denmark;D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Adequate, 3):

The Danish assessment for pressures has assessed the Baltic Sea and the North Sea separately; the assessment is very similar for both which is why the assessment of adequacy addresses them together. Physical damage is estimated to impact 75 to 100% of the North Sea seafloor and 50-75% of that in the Baltic. The identified causes of physical damage are bottom trawling, mussel dredging, raw material extraction and construction works. It is mentioned that stone extraction has been banned in 2000 but it should be noted that between 0,3-18kg of stones and shells may be removed from the seabed per tons of mussel landed thereby meaning that the loss of stones has not been fully halted. It is also noted that bottom trawling is regulated in Natura 2000 sites, the regulations and total area regulated however is not mentioned. The level of pressure as the result of activities resulting in physical damage is considered as not good but having a decreasing trend. 

Physical loss as a result of sealing due to wind mill parks, bridges, submersed tunnels, harbours, pipelines, offshore oil & gas installations are estimated to affect less than 1% of Danish marine waters. The level of pressure that is the result of physical loss is considered acceptable and stable. Other pressures mentioned are oxygen depletion, contamination with hazardous substances.

Denmark has identified knowledge gaps on the following topics: 
-	the extent and intensity of bottom trawling (in high resolution)
-	bottom fauna and importance of bottom fauna composition
-	species and communities in the soft bottom habitats
-	effect of bottom trawling on the soft bottoms with regards to the homogenization of the substrate
-	understanding of cumulative impacts
-	impact of opportunistic species on food webs and ecosystems  
-	distribution and biomass for fisheries
-	development of bottom fauna indices that can assess physical stress

The pressure of fisheries on fish species has been documented in the fisheries section while impacts on other functional groups and species have been described for birds and for harbour porpoises. The data used for this part of the assessment is however quite old, dating back to 2004 or earlier. 

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
In both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, Denmark has reported using the MSFD classification of predominant habitat types. In particular, Denmark has reported on five shallow habitat types (coarse and mixed sediment, mud, rock and sand) and four shelf habitat types (coarse and mixed sediment, mud and rock). Littoral habitats types have not been reported and neither have water column habitat types. Denmark does not provide any justification for not reporting on littoral habitats. For ‘Reduced salinity waters’, Denmark states that the whole of the Danish waters can be considered as belonging to this habitat. This would constitute all the more reasons to report on this habitat type, which Denmark does not do in the reporting sheet. 

In addition to predominant habitat types, Denmark reports on a number of listed habitats from the Habitats Directive and the OSPAR Convention. In particular, Denmark reports on habitat type 1170 (reefs) and 1180 (submarine structures made by leaking gases) from the Habitats Directive and on Modiolus modiolus beds and Sea-pen and burrowing megafauna communities from the OSPAR Convention. In addition, for the North Sea, Denmark reports on important areas for sandeel and on Haploops community (which is being assessed to be included in the HELCOM Commission’s Red List of Habitats). It acknowledges that this was formerly a widespread habitat in the region, but is now in serious decline. 

No qualitative assessment is provided for any of the habitats although reference is made to existing HELCOM and OSPAR initiatives. In effect no judgement has been made on the status of habitats although it is explained that data is available from EUSeamap and national surveys, but the data is not presented in the reporting sheets.

Denmark;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Denmark has defined four targets to cover D6. Three targets are state targets but Target 36, and its associated indicators, is clearly addressing specific pressures and human activities. 

Contrary to the targets for D1 and D4, the targets for D6 are less specific and do not address precise elements of biodiversity (e.g. specific substrates or benthic species). Furthermore the targets do not address the characteristics of specific habitat types. They are focused on “soft bottom” but do not mention the extent or condition of the habitat type. They only focus on species associated to this habitat. Habitat types identified by the initial assessment such as Modiolus modiolus are not mentioned in the targets. The targets also only target soft bottoms while stone reefs have been mentioned in the initial assessment a number of times but are not addressed by the targets.  

Target 36 is a pressure target focusing on the reduction of impacts from a number of human activities including bottom trawling, dumping, raw material extraction and construction works. However it does not provide details on how much reduction is expected for the achievement of the target and therefore it is not possible to know whether it will help achieve GES.

There is no reference to any of the criteria and indicators laid out in the Commission Decision (no criteria and/or indicators have been provided by Denmark) without any further justification for that. There is also no mention of any threshold values, baseline values or features and/or pressures addressed by GES.

There is no reference to the WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters or to any of OSPAR or HELCOM relevant documents.";The GES definition of Denmark for D7 is assessed as inadequate. The definition of GES is very general and takes into account only space and time aspect, not referring to habitats or functions. In addition, no gaps have been identified and no plans for the future have been mentioned. A much better definition of GES could be expected in HELCOM and OSPAR areas, where pressures and impacts are relatively well known.;"- Very general

Denmark;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"There is almost no information with regard to the level of pressure of permanent hydrographical alterations or to their impacts on water column or seabed habitats and the few data available are the same for both the Baltic Sea and the Great North Sea. The only justification advanced for the scarce data refers to the fact that hydrological processes and their impacts are investigated in relation to specific projects and that large construction works are subject to Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). In addition, there is no reference to OSPAR QSR or HELCOM HOLAS.

Judgments have not been made on the level of and impacts from hydrological changes apart from very general references to thermal discharges and salinity changes; however, Denmark has assessed the trend of the level of and impacts from hydrological changes as stable and has identified industry, offshore structures and land claim defence as the main causes of the pressure.";The initial assessment of Denmark for permanent hydrographical alterations is assessed as inadequate.

Denmark;D7;Consistency ;;Since there is no proper assessment of pressures and impacts and not set of environmental targets and indicators it is impossible to assess the consistency between the definition of GES, the initial assessment and the environmental targets.;;;;
Denmark;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Denmark has set GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. The GES definition is almost a copy of the definition of D8 in the Directive except Denmark mentions effects in the marine environment. 

Denmark sets GES at a very high qualitative level. No threshold values or baselines have been defined. The definition does not contain any reference to national, EU or regional standards. This means that there is no direct reference to the WFD/EQS or OSPAR’s EACs. The definition is not at all measurable or specific. 

In the accompanying text to the GES definition, Denmark explains the relationship between the WFD and the MSFD and the overlap between the monitoring for the MSFD and the monitoring taking place on coastal waters (up to 10 nautical miles) for concentrations and effects. It is not clear from the text that Denmark will apply WFD thresholds and measurement methods for the whole MSFD waters but it can be inferred from the text. Denmark also highlights its strategy regarding acute pollution events. ";The GES definition for D8 is considered inadequate. GES is defined only at descriptor level and only at a very high qualitative level. The GES definition does not refer to any standards and is neither specific nor measurable. ;"- GES defined at descriptor level only
- No mention of standards not to be exceeded, no reference to EQS Directive or to OSPAR
- No effective coverage of effects of contaminants on biological components
- No coverage of acute pollution events";1;Inadequate
Denmark;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is similar for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea as it was done together in the paper report. Only a few details vary when looking at specific areas. For this reason, the assessment of adequacy was done for the two regions together. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
In the reporting sheet, Denmark provides a concise account of the level of pressure from contamination by hazardous substances. It refers to the land-based sources of contamination (riverine inputs, direct discharges from sewage plants, industry, etc.), the sea-based sources (shipping, offshore oil and gas activity, dredging, aquaculture and transboundary transport). It provides a non-exhaustive list of the substances monitored by the national monitoring programmes (pesticides, phenols, aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, PCB, phthalates, dioxins and furanes, organotin coumounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS for synthetic substances; heavy metals and oil substances for non-synthetic substances). The estimates for the input loads from land-based sources are not reported in the reporting sheet but are extensively described in the paper report and directly referred to in the reporting sheet. There are no quantitative estimates for the input loads from sea- and air-based sources. 

The assessment of the level of contamination from hazardous substances in the environment is based on the HELCOM HOLAS assessment and concludes that the status of Danish waters is not good. Denmark reports that 75-100% of the assessment area is affected by the pressure. However, when Denmark makes a judgement on the level of the pressure in relation to GES in the North Sea, it judges that the chemical status of the North Sea and Skagerrak is good and that of the Kattegat is moderate to good. This is based on the results of the HARMONY status assessment (combined assessment in sediments, water column and biota based on EU environmental quality standards) rather than HELCOM HOLAS. The overall conclusions of HELCOM HOLAS apply rather to the Baltic part of the Danish waters, which Denmark judges as not in good status (except for a small area east of the Danish island of Moen).

Denmark also reports on the level of contamination in functional groups, showing that a number of substances (PAH, TBT, PCBs) are above effect levels in some areas. The impacts on seabed habitats are measured using the limit levels set by the American Environmental Protection Agency for effects on living organisms. For impacts on functional groups, Denmark uses OSPAR EcoQOs on sea snails and higher trophic levels (birds and mammals). The information reported in the reporting sheet is not quantified and does not include trends. Denmark does not make a judgement on the impacts of contamination on ecosystem components in relation to GES. 

Radionuclides
The assessment of contamination by radionuclides by Denmark is very limited. It mentions the land-, sea- and air-based sources of contamination (American Soviet atmospheric nuclear testing, Chernobyl incident and operation of European plants Sellafeld in UK and La Hague in France). The Fukushima incident is also mentioned. In terms of assessment, Denmark only mentions that concentrations show decreasing trends for the substances 90Sr, 137Cs and 99Tc. No assessment of impacts and no judgement on GES are made.  

Acute pollution events
Denmark provides a concise, quantitative, description of oil spills and illegal discharges registered. No assessment is made of impacts from acute pollution on ecosystem components. No judgement is made on the level of contamination from acute pollution. Denmark only mentions that acute pollution events are registered through the Bonn Agreement. It also mentions that the pressure is considered low, based on expert judgement. ";The initial assessment of contamination of the Danish marine waters by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered adequate. The information reported in the reporting sheet by Denmark is very limited and not quantified. But it is supported by a quantitative, analysis in the paper report of the level of contamination by hazardous substances, radioactive substances and acute pollution. In addition, Denmark makes a judgement on the chemical status of its marine waters in reference to HELCOM and EU legislation. ;"- Coverage of relevant sources of contamination
- Quantitative assessment of contamination by hazardous substances (synthetic and non-synthetic substances, radionuclides) and acute pollution events
- Judgement on level of pressure in relation to GES (on the basis of HELCOM HOLAS/HARMONY results)
- A quantitative assessment but no judgement on impacts on ecosystem components";3;Adequate
Denmark;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Denmark has set two targets to cover Descriptor 8. Two indicators are associated to the first target. No indicators have been developed for the second target. 

The first target, on concentration of contaminants, makes reference to environmental quality standards used in existing legislation. There is no further specification of what “existing legislation” entails. The accompanying text in the paper report, the same as the GES definition, reference is made to the WFD and the EQS. However, as for the GES definition, Denmark does not make a clear link between this explanatory text and the targets. 

The indicators set for Target 38 specify the substances and the biological effect which should be measured to assess the achievement of the target. It is inconsistent however that Denmark has set an indicator on biological effects when it has not included this aspect in the text of the target. 

The second target on acute pollution events is not exactly the same as the operational target defined within OSPAR. It goes in the same direction as far as the occurrence and extent of acute pollution events are concerned (reduction), and even specifies the tools that will be used for this, but does not mention impacts of acute events on biota. 

The targets are potentially measurable and definitely realistic but they lack some specific details to be fully operational. Denmark acknowledges that the threshold values still need to be specified. ";The set of targets defined by Denmark to cover Descriptor 8 is considered as partially adequate. Target 38 and its indicators are potentially measurable and quantified but there is a lack of specification of what existing legislation is addressed by the target (and thus what threshold values). There is an inconsistency between the second indicator on biological effects and the target, which does not mention these. Target 39 is not measurable as it is not associated with a specific threshold value or a trend. ;"- First target potentially measurable and quantified targets but lack of specification regarding standards used for the targets
- Indicator on biological effects defined but not included in the scope of the main target
- Second target not measurable";2;Partially adequate
Denmark;D8;Consistency ;;"The assessment of pressure and impacts from contamination by hazardous substances is consistent with the GES definition considering that the latter is very general and high-level. However, Denmark makes a judgement on the level of contamination in the Danish waters on the basis of EU legislation (presumably the WFD and the EQS), which is not integrated into the GES definition itself but only mentioned the accompanying text. 

The targets set for concentration and impacts of contaminants are consistent with the initial assessment. The same substances and biological effects as addressed by the indicators are integrated in the initial assessment. 

The targets are also consistent with the GES definition, again because it is very general, and are probably sufficient to achieve GES. ";;;;
Denmark;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Denmark has set GES for Descriptor 9 at the level of the descriptor only. The GES definition is not a reformulation of the definition of the Directive. It is rephrased so as to put an emphasis on effects on human health. The Danish definition is less specific than the definition in the Directive as it does not refer to Community legislation or other relevant standards. No reference is made to the Commission Decision criterion and indicators. It is also not specified what is meant with “adversely affected”. 

In the accompanying text to the GES definition, in the paper report, Denmark specifies that D9 addresses the quality of edible tissues of captured or harvested fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and seaweed in reference to substances for which maximum levels are established at EU levels. This explanation indicates that Denmark addresses Regulation 1881/2006 in its GES definition. But there is no direct reference to this in either the GES definition or the accompanying text. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 9 is considered as inadequate. GES is defined only at the descriptor level and is very general. No reference is made to Regulation 1881/2006 in the definition or the accompanying text (although it can be inferred). There is no specification of the fish and seafood covered by the definition or the substances concerned (presumably those covered by Regulation 1881/2006 but it is not explicitly stated). ;"- GES defined only at descriptor level and partially in comparison to the GES definition in Annex I MSFD
- No reference to Community legislation or any other standard
- Does not include a requirement for concentrations not to exceed a certain level";1;Inadequate
Denmark;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Denmark has done an assessment of contamination of fish and seafood only for heavy metals in mussels and flounder. It has assessed that these were below EU limits (presumably Regulation 1881/2006 although it is not specified). It has not made a similar assessment for synthetic substances or radionuclides. 

Denmark made an assessment for the level of pressure and impacts related to microbial pathogens, only for bathing water. For bathing waters, the level of the pressure is considered as good in coastal waters. The trend of the pressure is assessed as stable. The main cause of the pressure is urban wastewater. Shellfish waters are not covered by the assessment although Denmark has a large shellfish aquaculture sector. ";The initial assessment of the contamination by hazardous substances of fish and other seafood (including from microbial pathogens) is considered partially adequate. Denmark makes a limited assessment, only for heavy metals in mussels and flounders. The assessment on microbial pathogens does not cover shellfish waters (only bathing waters) whereas shellfish aquaculture is present in Danish marine waters. Denmark does make a judgement in relation to EU limits. ;"- Very limited assessment only for heavy metals (not for man-made substances) and only in mussels and flounders
- Assessment of microbial pathogens contamination only for bathing waters, not shellfish waters
- Judgement made in relation to EU limits";2;Partially adequate
Denmark;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Denmark has defined one target and one associated indicator to cover D9. The target is the same for the two marine regions. The Danish target for D9 is the same as the definition of GES for D9 in the Directive. The associated indicator provides the list of substances to be monitored for the achievement of the target. It states “in fish and other seafood for human consumption”, which is not specific as to exactly what fish and seafood should be monitored.

The target is measurable in the sense that it refers to Community legislation (presumably Regulation 1881/2006 although it is specified neither in the text of the target nor in the accompanying text). It also refers to other relevant standards without specifying further what these are. The target is presumably realistic and achievable although no time-scale is set for its achievement. ";The set of target and indicator defined by Denmark to cover Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. The target/indicators are measurable through their reference to Community legislation however there is a clear lack of specificity regarding what legislation is covered and what fish and seafood should be monitored. ;"- Target is SMART as it directly refers to Community legislation, hence provides a reference value
- Indicator provides a list of substances to measure but does not specify in which species of fish/shellfish";2;Partially adequate
Denmark;D9;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the impacts of contamination on fish and seafood is not fully consistent with the GES definition as the latter is very general, and would therefore address more substances and products for human consumption than those assessed in the initial assessment. 

The target is also not fully consistent with the initial assessment (or the other way round) because it covers a number of synthetic substances which have not been assessed in the initial assessment. It is consistent however in its reference to Community legislation, as used in the initial assessment to measure the levels of certain heavy metals in mussels and flounders. 

Finally, it is not certain whether the achievement of the environmental target defined would lead to the achievement of GES as GES is so vaguely defined. But it is certain that it will contribute to it.   ";;;;
Estonia;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Estonia has defined GES for Descriptor 1 very differently in the reporting sheet and in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, GES is defined at criteria level with definitions that are not specific with regard to the biological component covered. In the paper report, GES is defined at indicator level and the indicators are very specific, addressing one specific species/habitat/community per indicator and overall covering all seven criteria of the Commission Decision. 

The criteria are covered for a number of different species. Criterion 1.1, on species distribution, only addresses mammals (grey and ringed seals) and one species of birds (smew). It also covers the distributional range of a number of habitats, which are reproduced under criterion 1.4. Criterion 1.2 is covered only for seals and criterion 1.3 on the population condition is covered only for one species (Mute Swan Cugnus olor) in a specific context. The habitats criteria and indicators cover four distinct habitats systematically: bladder wrack, eelgrass, Furcellaria lumbricalis and charophyte. Water column habitats seem to not be covered by the GES indicators nor are zoobenthos habitats. Finally, criterion 1.7 on the ecosystem structure is only partially covered since only the fish community is covered by the three indicators. The indicators seem to be more applicable to D4 (although food webs and ecosystem structure are inter-related). Other aspects of the ecosystem are not mentioned and the inter-linkages between the components covered in the rest of the definitions are not mentioned. In general, Estonia has not defined GES equally for all ecosystem components. 

Threshold values are provided for some of these definitions but not all of them. Threshold values are sometimes defined against reference conditions but it is not clear what these reference conditions are. It is not specified in the reporting sheet not in the main text of the report on Articles 9 and 10. In the annex specifying further the indicators, threshold values and reference conditions are clearly provided, when they have been developed. The indicators still under development include 1.2.1.2, 1.4.2.1 and all the indicators on the condition of the benthic community (criterion 1.6).

In terms of baselines, Estonia sometimes refers to historical conditions or to a specific time period (e.g. six years for indicator 1.1.1.3). A number of threshold values are absolute target reference points that should be achieved and therefore do not necessarily need a baseline or reference conditions. 

In the annex to the paper report, when explaining how it has developed each of its GES indicators for D1, Estonia refers very regularly to the Habitats Directive and to HELCOM. Therefore a number of the species and habitats covered in the GES definitions for D1 are listed under the Habitats and Birds Directive or under HELCOM. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 1 is considered partially adequate. GES definitions are provided for all criteria of the Commission Decision and most of them are quantified through threshold values but they are focused only on a few key species and habitats. ;"- GES defined at indicator level 
- All criteria of the Commission Decision covered
- Most criteria quantified through threshold values 
- Focused only on a few key species and habitats";2;Partially adequate 
Estonia;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Estonia in the reporting sheets has reported on a number of individual species: Cygnus olor, Chara connivens, Fucus vesiculosus, Halichoerus grypus, Mergus albellus, Phoca hispida botnica. In the paper report, the information is more detailed and mammals (seals) are also covered. 

In the paper report, Estonia reports on seabed fauna, anadromous fish, coastal marine fishes, demersal fishes, pelagic fishes, cyclostomes (lampreys), seabirds and marine mammals especially on the Grey seal and ringed seal.

In the paper report on Articles 9 and 10, Estonia has made an assessment of the current status of marine biodiversity according to the GES indicators it has defined. Out of the 11 indicators relevant for species (under D1), eight are considered to be achieved (at GES), two are considered not to be achieved (on the distributional range and pattern of the ringed seal) while the status of one indicator (ringed seal abundance) is unknown. Out of the seven indicators developed for D4, three are considered not to be achieved (smolt production of Baltic salmon, abundance index of large perch and Copepod/mesozooplankton biomass ratio), two are considered achieved (MMLI and community trophic index) while another two are unknown. 

Habitats
Estonia carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the Baltic Sea. Five habitats have been reported in the reporting sheets, all under the “special and other habitats” category: Eelgrass (Zostera marina) habitat, Bladder wrack (Fucus vesiculosus) habitat, Furcellaria lumbricalis habitat and Charophyte habitat. For all habitats the habitat distribution and extent have been judged as being at good status, the habitat condition and habitat overall are not assessed. 

The first part of the assessment of benthic habitats in the initial assessment is done by providing the result of a study from 2013 on the spatial distribution marine benthic habitats was included in the initial assessment.  The following habitats were described and the spatial distribution within selected study areas was shown on a map:
-	Sheltered hard bottoms with:
o 	Fucus vesiculosus
o 	bivalves and Amphibalanus improvises
o 	no particular species dominance
-	Sheltered soft bottoms with:
o	 higher plants
o 	charophytes
o 	bivalves
o 	no particular species dominance
-	Moderately exposed hard bottoms with:
o 	F. vesiculosus
o 	Furcellaria lumbricalis
o 	bivalves and A. improvises
-	Moderately exposed hard bottoms in photic zone with no particular species dominance
-	Moderately exposed hard bottoms in aphotic zone with no particular species dominance
-	Moderately exposed soft bottoms with:
o 	Zostera marina 
o 	higher plants excluding Z. marina
o 	charophytes
o 	F. lumbricalis
o 	bivalves
o 	no particular species dominance   

The second part of the assessment on benthic habitats in Estonian waters is done by providing a map showing the spatial distribution of habitats as defined in Annex I of the Habitats Directive. These are; estuaries (1130), reefs (1170), sandbank (1110), mudflats and sandflats (1140), large shallow inlets and bays (1160) and coastal lagoons (1150). 

A third study on red algae proliferation in the Kassari bay, this seems to be included for its economic rather than biodiversity importance. Furthermore Estonia has reported on Estonian benthic communities in relation to the BQI index.

Water column habitats are only described in general terms and with a map showing data collected on water transparency. However, Estonia does report on phyto and zooplankton in the paper report. 

In the paper report on Articles 9 and 10, Estonia has made an assessment of the current status of marine biodiversity according to the GES indicators it has defined. Out of the 17 indicators relevant for habitats (under D1), 10 are considered to be achieved (at GES) while the status of the other seven is unknown (depth distribution of eelgrass and the six indicators on the condition of the benthic community (criterion 1.6)). Out of the four indicators developed for D6, Estonia has assessed that they are all already current in good status (at GES). 

Ecosystems
In the reporting sheets Estonia reports on the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea and refers to the fact that HELCOM has assessed the Baltic ecosystem structure to be in line with natural conditions while the productivity, proportion of species at the top of food-webs and abundance of key trophic groups and species are altered. In the paper report on Articles 9 and 10, Estonia has made an assessment of the current status of marine biodiversity according to the GES indicators it has defined. Out of the three indicators relevant for ecosystems (under D1), two are considered to be achieved (at GES) while the third one (abundance index of piscivores) is considered not achieved (not at GES).
";The initial assessment by Estonia of biological features is considered partially adequate. The level of detail varies depending on the information available but generally has not synthesized the information to determine the status of the various features.  Reporting in the reporting sheets is very poor.;"Features:
- Not all habitats or species/functional groups are covered
- There is an effort to assess the current status in relation to GES";2;Partially adequate 
Estonia;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Estonia has defined seven targets and a number of associated indicators to cover D1.  The seven targets correspond to the seven criteria of the Commission Decision and read more like GES definitions than targets. They are generally worded and a number of terms would need more specificity to make the target potentially measurable. It is not clear for instance what is considered to be the natural distribution range of the key species or what is meant with long-term survival. In general the targets for habitats aim at conservation of current status, so the concept of no further decline is addressed

The indicators are the same as the indicators for GES. The threshold values that are associated with these indicators in the reporting sheet are also the same (when actually reported). A number of threshold values are not reported. Baselines/reference conditions are not provided either. 

The analysis of the indicators and how well they cover the Commission Decision has been done in the GES section of this chapter and will not be repeated here. 

No target addresses reduction of pressure from human activities. ";The set of target and indicators defined by Estonia for D1 is considered inadequate. The targets read rather as GES definitions than targets and the indicators are the same as the GES indicators but sometimes less specific (no threshold value). The targets have not been used as a tool to help achieve GES. This is particularly true for the indicators that are considered not to be currently achieved. But even for those considered already at GES, it is not certain that these targets/indicators will be sufficient to maintain GES by 2020.;"- Targets are rather GES definitions
- Same indicators as for GES but less specific (no threshold value)
- Not SMART 
- Not certain that these targets/indicators will be sufficient to maintain GES by 2020";1;Inadequate
Estonia;D1;Consistency ;;"There is a good level of consistency in general between the initial assessment, the GES definition and the targets for the biodiversity descriptors. The same habitats and species that are reported in the initial assessment are used as GES indicators, showing perhaps their prevalence in Estonia’s marine biodiversity monitoring. They are also the same species and habitats used for the targets, which is in line with the fact that the target indicators are the same as the GES indicators.

The lack of data and knowledge on the pressures on the seafloor, leading to a very limited assessment to date, is not compensated by the definition of specific GES indicators or specific targets to collect more information and potentially reduce the pressures by 2020. ";;;;
Estonia;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"In the reporting sheet, Estonia has not defined GES for Descriptor 10. In the paper report on Articles 9 and 10, Estonia provides four indicators to define what GES for D10 is in Estonian marine waters:
10.1.1.1. Trends in the amount of litter washed ashore and/or deposited on coastlines
10.1.2.1. Trends in the amount of litter in the water column
10.1.3.1 Trends in litter deposited on the sea- floor
10.2.1.1. Trends in swallowed trash by marine wildlife

However, it explains that because of a lack of data and methodology, it is not able to assign a GES boundary to any of these indicators. It therefore seems that Estonia considers that it has not defined GES for D10. In the paper report, it is suggested that there either needs to be an improvement in the methodology of the systematic data collection program or that a pilot study should be undertaken. There are however no further details on whether such actions will be undertaken or when they might occur.
 ";Not reported.;- Not reported;0;Not reported
Estonia;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"No information is reported in the reporting sheet on marine litter. In the paper report, there is a brief description of the issues related to marine litter. Estonia first describes the problem of marine litter and its origins in a general manner (not specific to Estonian waters) and then describes how marine litter can be monitored and measured. 

Based on HELCOM’s assessments, it describes briefly the main sources of marine litter in the Baltic Sea (shipping, tourism and recreational areas). For Estonia specifically, the reports only mentions the results from a UNESCO project entitled “Baltic Sea Coast Watch”, for which marine litter was picked up from beaches. It acknowledges that it has no data on marine litter in the water column or on the seabed or on microparticles. 

Impacts on the ecosystem are described briefly (entanglement and ingestion) but no assessment has been made on the impacts from marine litter on the Estonian ecosystem. 

No judgement is made on the current levels of pressure in relation to GES, which is explained by the fact that GES has not been defined yet. ";The assessment of the level of and impact from marine litter in the Estonian environment is considered inadequate. The information reported is very limited and consists mostly of descriptions of the problem in the Baltic Sea in general rather than focused on Estonian waters.

Estonia;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Estonia has defined two targets and four associated indicators to cover D10. The targets are very general and strangely worded. Target 26 asks for a minimal amount of litter, but does not specify what the amount would entail. However the three associated indicators are more specific and potentially measurable but they are a copy of the indicators and criteria in the 2010 Commission Decision.

Target 27 states that deviations should be irrelevant. It is not clear what is meant with irrelevant and Estonia has not defined threshold values. In addition to refers to the habitat quality of marine biota but the indicator associated only focuses on ingestion by animals and therefore does not cover habitats. 

No threshold values have been set for any of the indicators meaning that neither indicators nor targets are SMART. ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Estonia to cover D10 is considered inadequate. The targets are very general and not specific enough with regard to certain terms (e.g. “irrelevant”).

Estonia;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"In the reporting sheet, Estonia has not defined GES for Descriptor 11. In the paper report on Articles 9 and 10, Estonia provides two indicators to define what GES for D11 is in Estonian marine waters:

10.1.2.1. Trends in the low frequent noise level

However, it explains that because of a lack of data and methodology, it is not able to assign a GES boundary to any of these indicators. It therefore seems that Estonia considers that it has not defined GES for D11. It is mentioned in the paper report that a team of experts analysed existing information and international experience to identify the two indicators which would allow for the further development of the monitoring program start up. There is however no information provided on whether such a monitoring program will be initiated or when this would occur.";Not reported.;- Not reported;0;Not reported
Estonia;D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"No information is provided in the reporting sheet on underwater noise. In the paper report, Estonia has provided a short assessment mostly based on HELCOM’s assessment of noise sources and intensity and noise mapping across the Baltic Sea area. It discusses noise sources in Estonian waters (shipping, port construction, mine blasting) but explains that it lacks data to make a proper assessment. 

Impacts on marine animals are also discussed in a different section of the paper report. Estonia describes the different types of impacts of marine organisms from noise but rather at the scale of the Baltic Sea than specifically for Estonian marine waters. It does discuss in details impacts on ringed seal and grey seal populations in the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga, which cover Estonian waters. The impacts cover mostly trends in population abundance and density, concluding that impacts on populations are not systematic. 

No judgement is made on the current levels of pressure in relation to GES, which is explained by the fact that GES has not been defined yet. ";The assessment of underwater noise by Estonia is considered partially adequate. The assessment provided in the paper report is focused on the sources of underwater noise but does not seem to discuss the two types of noise. Impacts on seal populations are discussed.

Estonia;D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Estonia has defined two targets, each associated with one indicator, to cover D11. The targets are very general. They are impact-based targets and do not address the pressure/sources of noise.  

The first target is general and probably not realistic as habitat quality in all marine life affected by noise would be impossible to measure. It will be very difficult to define a target threshold value to measure this deviation. The indicator is more specific and potentially measurable but no threshold value has been defined. It also does not seem sufficient to fully cover Target 28, which relates to impacts on marine life. 

Target 29 seems not to be correctly formulated as it stops after “deviations” and it is not clear what deviation is covered by the target.

Estonia;D11;Consistency ;;There is a clear lack of consistency in that Estonia does not seem to have defined GES for Descriptor 11 but it has defined a set of targets and indicators. The targets read rather as a GES definition than targets defined to help achieve GES. The indicators associated with the targets actually correspond to the Commission Decision criteria. ;;;;
Estonia;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"In the reporting sheet, GES is defined at the criteria level. Without taking into account the definitions at indicator level set in the paper report, the definitions at criteria level remain very vague. 

The first two indicators relate to indicator 2.1.1 of the Commission Decision, more precisely at trends in abundance. Both indicators have a quantitative element in the sense they refer to 80% of the time period. However, they remain vague as to what would be considered as ‘significantly’ higher. The two indicators cover pelagic and benthic invertebrate NIS. In addition, an indicator set under Descriptor 3 set the same kind of targets for fish NIS (targeting gillnet monitoring catches). This indicator is worded as follows: Catch per unit effort of alien species in gillnet monitoring catches- At least 80 - % of the time series the yield of alien species is not significantly higher than the lowest level of biomass recorded in corresponding time series. 

The two remaining indicators relate to the ratio of NIS/native species and cover zooplankton and mizoobenthic communities. Similarly to the other indicators, they do not specify what would be considered as ‘significantly’ higher. With these indicators, all relevant species groups are covered. 

While the first definition focuses on the state of the pressure, the second one relates to surveillance and applies to coastal and transitional waters. It refers to the bio-pollution index, in line with the HELCOM approach, and is therefore based on an assessment of the abundance and distribution range of NIS and the magnitude of their impacts on native communities, habitats and ecosystem functioning. According to the definition at indicator level, the threshold is 1 as the bio-pollution index should be below 1. In the index ranging from 0 (no impact) to 4 (massive impact), the level 1 represents a state of ‘moderate impact’.";The GES definition for D2 is considered as partially adequate. Taking into account the definitions set at indicator level, GES definitions are quite detailed. They target specific species groups and include thresholds. However, despites the thresholds set by the definition, the term ‘significantly higher’ is not further specified and the minimum requirements are not clearly stated (no new introductions of NIS, and where possible no further spreading of them).;"- GES defined at indicator level

Indicator 3.1.1.1 requires a number of stocks to be exploited below the Fmsy reference point (Herring, Sprat). The indicator does not cover all stocks and does not cover cod which is one of the most important commercial species in the Baltic, although it is not an abundant species in Estonian waters.  Indicator 3.1.1.3 deals with alien species and is therefore also relevant for Descriptor 2. 

Indicators 3.2.1.1 and 3.2.1.2 deal with the reproductive capacity of Salmo salar, Perca fluviatilis but do not apply the Commission Decision indicators and do not cover all stocks which is not in line with Descriptor 3 which requires all stocks to be within safe biological limits.

Indicator 4.1.1.1 is also provided as an indicator for Descriptor 3 and does not seem a particularly well suited match indicator 4.1.1 as it is defined in the Commission Decision. Furthermore, smolt production might be strongly affected by developments within rivers rather than changes in the marine food-web. 

Indicator 4.2.1.1 dealing with the abundance index of large Perca fluviatilis has also been used for Descriptor 3. It could be useful to monitor changes of the brackish areas but not the more saline waters. Indicator 4.2.1.2 deals with changes in the mean length composition of fish species which should remain stable or increase.

Estonia;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Estonia has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at criteria level in the reporting sheet and at indicator levels in the paper report. No qualitative definition is provided, Estonia just lists the relevant criteria/indicators together with the associated threshold values. 

All criteria and most of the indicators of the 2010 Commission Decision are addressed. Indicators 5.1.2 (nutrient ratios) and 5.3.2 (dissolved oxygen status) have no baselines set and no justification is provided for not considering these indicators. Other indicators/criteria have been considered, but the GES thresholds are semi-quantitative at best, since reference conditions are not specified. Alternative criteria are not proposed and there is a lack of monitoring data to determine whether those criteria adopted to determine achievement/non-achievement of GES (eutrophication) thresholds are realistic to achieve by 2020.

For the definition of GES, Estonia has used the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD)-based classification system, an ecological quality ratio (EQR), which is the ratio of the measured value and the reference number. Estonia notes that the values set for GES are consistent with the WFD moderate good and moderate status classes. The moderate class under the WFD might however not be considered equivalent to GES under the MSFD. ";The GES definition of Estonia for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. Dissolved oxygen status needs to be included in the definition, species shifts in floristic composition need further explanation and it remains unclear as to whether nutrient ratios are appropriate/relevant. In addition, the definition of GES needs to include reference conditions as well as EQRs. The determination of GES (MSFD) is comparable to GES (WFD), but the type-specific nature of WFD moderate/good status thresholds means that the two may not equate directly/automatically. ;"- All criteria and most of the indicators of the 2010 Commission Decision are covered

Estonia;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Estonia has carried out an initial assessment on the level of pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. In the reporting sheets the assessment focuses on pressures and consists of the indication of the main causes of pressure (agriculture, forestry, urban discharges and shipping), the total loads of nitrogen and phosphorus and the concentrations (in percentages) of nitrogen and phosphorus. Trends (always “stable”, but for the level of concentration of nitrogen) and judgements (always “not good”) on the current level of pressure are also presented. On impacts on water column and seabed habitats, only trends (always “stable) and judgements (always “not good”) are presented. In terms of data and knowledge gaps, Estonia acknowledges that it has not determined on which features the pressure has an impact as well as the proportion of the impacted feature as regards water column and seabed. No specific plans are provided to address the gaps.

Although the information presented in the paper report is more detailed, it is still generic and mainly descriptive. Some sources of loads of the relevant nutrients, but also of organic matter, are described and qualitative trends are provided in some cases (even though some of the data is quite old). Impacts on the seabed habitats and species groups are also described, albeit at high level. HELCOM reports and the WFD are referred to.

In the paper report on Articles 9 and 10, Estonia makes a judgement on the current level of pressure from eutrophication. It looks at each GES indicator separately. Out of 11 indicators defined, GES is considered to be achieved for four, not achieved for five and needing further development for two. The indicators that have reached GES are: proportion of annual species in benthic vegetation (5.2.3.1), depth distribution of phytobenthos (5.2.4.1), depth distribution of Fucus vesiculosus (5.2.4.2), proportion of perennial species in benthic vegetation (5.3.1.1). The indicators that are considered not to be at GES include: summer concentration of total nitrogen in seawater (5.1.1.1), summer concentration of total phosphorus in seawater (5.1.1.2), summer chlorophyll a concentration in seawater (5.2.1.1), summer phytoplankton wet weight biomass (5.2.1.2), summer-time Secchi depth transparency (5.2.2.1).";The initial assessment of Estonia for pressure eutrophication is assessed as partially adequate. The assessment covers all the relevant nutrients and organic matter but is very generalised and offers little detail, e.g. on geographical area. Much more information is needed on pressures and some key impacts, including nutrient levels. Some pressures are not considered and impacts are described only at high level. Trends and judgements are presented. Reference is made to HELCOM reports and the WFD.;"- The assessment covers all the relevant nutrients and organic matter but is very general

Estonia;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Estonia has defined three environmental targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 5 in the reporting sheet. The targets are all unspecific with regard to pressures, but are specific with regard to impacts. They define GES and are expressed as EcoQOs or WFD-derived typology-specific EQRs raising the question whether offshore national waters are of the same typology as corresponding inshore waters, which is likely to make any assessment of their achievement difficult.

Target 16 effectively functions as a definition of GES. It is specific in terms of impacts, but not pressures and it is not time-bound. Target 17 uses summer biomass of phytoplankton as its indicator. The presumption here is that type-specific EQRs have been established under the WFD, so this is specific and measureable. Target 18 has the proportion of perennial taxa in the phytobenthos as an indicator (a complex and difficult-to-monitor indicator), so it should be measurable. The target fails to include an indicator for dissolved oxygen status, which could greatly impact zoobenthos and demersal fish populations. 

While the targets are consistent for nutrients, any reference to organic enrichment as a pressure is avoided. Target 17 by inference includes phytoplankton as an organic carbon pressure, but land-derived organic material is not considered.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Estonia for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The targets are all unspecific and are rather expressions of GES than targets defined to help achieve GES. The indicators are very specific but they are identical to the GES indicators.

The targets may be sufficient to maintain GES for the indicators that Estonia considers already at GES but they may not be sufficient for the other indicators which still need to achieve GES.

Estonia;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Estonia has defined Descriptor 6 at criteria level in the reporting sheet and at indicator level in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, the definition of criterion 6.2 is considered irrelevant. 

In the paper report, indicator 6.2.1.1 has thresholds but it is not entirely clear how relevant this indicator is for Descriptor 6. Indicators 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.3 both cover indicator 6.2.2 of the Commission Decision. Both have a threshold set at 0.5. For the Zoobenthos community index, this should correspond to a high ecological quality and should be compatible with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. In regards to the FDI index, 1 characterizes the best conditions while 0 corresponds to the most degraded community, the threshold 0.5 could be understood to require the habitat diversity in the phytobenthic zone to be at or above moderate quality. 

In addition to the indicators for D6, some of the indicators defined for D1, on the condition of the certain benthic communities are also relevant for D6.

The habitats criteria and indicators cover four distinct habitats systematically: bladder wrack, eelgrass, Furcellaria lumbricalis and charophyte. Water column habitats seem to not be covered by the GES indicators nor are zoobenthos habitats. Finally, criterion 1.7 on the ecosystem structure is only partially covered since only the fish community is covered by the three indicators. The indicators seem to be more applicable to D4 (although food webs and ecosystem structure are inter-related). Other aspects of the ecosystem are not mentioned and the inter-linkages between the components covered in the rest of the definitions are not mentioned.

Estonia has carried out a very limited initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage for the Baltic Sea. Estonia justifies this due to lack of data but no detail plans to address the existing knowledge gaps are provided. In the reporting sheets almost no information is reported; Estonia indicates that 1-5% of the environment/seabed habitats are impacted by physical loss and physical damage and lists renewable energy and dredging as the main causes of physical loss and physical damage, respectively.

In the paper report, the assessment on physical loss focuses on smothering as Estonia indicates that that there is no information available on sealing. The information is brief and mainly descriptive. The information reported on physical damage is a little bit more detailed and focuses on abrasion and selective extraction. Estonia describes very briefly the pressures (and to a smaller extent, the impacts), quantifying some parameters. Maps of the locations where sand extraction takes place are also provided. No conclusive judgements on the current level of pressure and impact from both physical loss and physical damage are provided.

Habitats
Estonia carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the Baltic Sea. Five habitats have been reported in the reporting sheets, all under the “special and other habitats” category: Eelgrass (Zostera marina) habitat, Bladder wrack (Fucus vesiculosus) habitat, Furcellaria lumbricalis habitat and Charophyte habitat. For all habitats the habitat distribution and extent have been judged as being at good status, the habitat condition and habitat overall are not assessed. 

The first part of the assessment of benthic habitats in the initial assessment is done by providing the result of a study from 2013 on the spatial distribution marine benthic habitats was included in the initial assessment.  The following habitats were described and the spatial distribution within selected study areas was shown on a map:
- Sheltered hard bottoms with:
o Fucus vesiculosus
o bivalves and Amphibalanus improvises
o no particular species dominance
- Sheltered soft bottoms with:
o higher plants
o charophytes
o bivalves
o no particular species dominance
- Moderately exposed hard bottoms with:
o F. vesiculosus
o Furcellaria lumbricalis
o bivalves and A. improvises
- Moderately exposed hard bottoms in photic zone with no particular species dominance
- Moderately exposed hard bottoms in aphotic zone with no particular species dominance
- Moderately exposed soft bottoms with:
o Zostera marina 
o higher plants excluding Z. marina
o charophytes
o F. lumbricalis
o bivalves
o no particular species dominance  

The second part of the assessment on benthic habitats in Estonian waters is done by providing a map showing the spatial distribution of habitats as defined in Annex I of the Habitats Directive. These are; estuaries (1130), reefs (1170), sandbank (1110), mudflats and sandflats (1140), large shallow inlets and bays (1160) and coastal lagoons (1150). 

A third study on red algae proliferation in the Kassari bay, this seems to be included for its economic rather than biodiversity importance. Furthermore Estonia has reported on Estonian benthic communities in relation to the BQI index.

Water column habitats are only described in general terms and with a map showing data collected on water transparency. However, Estonia does report on phyto and zooplankton in the paper report. 

In the paper report on Articles 9 and 10, Estonia has made an assessment of the current status of marine biodiversity according to the GES indicators it has defined. Out of the 17 indicators relevant for habitats (under D1), 10 are considered to be achieved (at GES) while the status of the other seven is unknown (depth distribution of eelgrass and the six indicators on the condition of the benthic community (criterion 1.6)).

Estonia;D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);In the reporting sheets Estonia has defined two targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 7. The text uploaded in the reporting sheets is not completely clear (there are some repetitions) but it is apparent that the two targets and associated indicators are based on the 2010 Commission Decision criteria and indicators for Descriptor 7 with a few additional mentions of spatial scale of changes, to “water quality indicators” (not specified) and to impacts (“habitat distribution and functions”. The set of targets is not specific, not measurable and not time-bound. The targets are not focused on any specific pressure or impact. No thresholds have been provided and no indications are given on the way the targets can be achieved.  ;The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Estonia for D7 is assessed as inadequate. No real target has been defined by Estonia to address the pressure of and impacts from permanent hydrographical changes. The targets reported are very close to the 2010 Commission Decision criteria and indicators for Descriptor 7 with a few additional mentions. They are not specific, measurable and not time-bound.;"- No real target has been defined

Estonia;D7;Consistency ;;It is impossible to assess the consistency between the definition of GES, the initial assessment and the environmental targets since no GES has been reported, the initial assessment is very limited and the targets listed are not real environmental targets but a reformulation of the 2010 Commission Decision criteria and indicators for Descriptor 7.;;;;
Estonia;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Estonia has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at criteria level in the reporting sheet and at indicator level in the paper report. In the paper report, GES covers (partially) the two criteria of the Commission Decision (concentration and effects of contaminants) through three categories of indicators: 
1.	One category focuses on the concentration of a number of substances (listed above) in the water, using as threshold values the values of the EQS Directive (annual average value (AA) and/or a maximum allowable concentration (MAC)). These values are not reproduced in the main text of the report but are provided in the annex of the report, which describes extensively how each indicator has been developed. 
2.	One category of indicators focuses on impacts on the ecosystem, which for Estonia entails measuring concentration levels in biota. This category comprises lists the same substances as in the first category but in the annex, exact threshold values for concentration levels in biota are provided only for a selection of these substances (Hg, PAHs, PBDEs, PFOS, HCBD, dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs). 
3.	Finally one category of indicators focuses on acute pollution and the presence of certain contaminants as indicating acute pollution. The substances used in this category are the same as in the other two categories however and no particular threshold values or methodology is developed by Estonia to explain why these substances are good indicators of acute pollution. 

Concentration of contaminants
The basis for the threshold value is clearly indicated as the EQS Directive. For substances measured in biota, only two of these substances have EQS defined in Directive 2008/105/EC for measurement in biota (Hg and HCBD), it is not clear where the threshold values defined by Estonia for the other substances come from. Estonia might have made use of the provision included in Article 3(2)(c) of the EQS Directive, according to which they have established an EQS in biota themselves. It is also likely that they are using the HELCOM standards (e.g. for PBDEs). 

The substances selected by Estonia cover most of the priority substances as established pursuant to the Water Framework Directive. 

Effects of contaminants
Estonia has set a number of GES boundaries/threshold values for concentration levels in biota but it does not mention any specific biological effects, such as imposex or lysosomal membrane stability, for which HELCOM has defined specific GES boundaries. 

Indicator 8.2.2 on acute pollution is covered only from the perspective of the presence of certain substances in the water but pollution events (e.g. oil spills) and their impacts on marine life (e.g. oiled birds) are not at all covered by Estonia’s GES indicators. In addition, the substances covered by the GES definition do not include petroleum hydrocarbons ";The GES definition for D8 by Estonia is considered partially adequate. It defines precisely which substances are relevant and what threshold values should be used as GES boundaries, in line with the EQS Directive and with HELCOM standards. Estonia has defined GES for effects of contaminants only through the concentration levels of a number of substances in fish but it has not included any specific biological effects in the scope of its definition.  Indicator 8.2.2 is not considered covered by the Estonian GES definition for D8.;"- GES defined at indicator level
- Clear definition of substances and threshold values as GES boundaries
- In line with EQS Directive and HELCOM standards
- Criterion 8.2 defined only through concentration levels of substances in fish 
- No biological effects included

Estonia;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Estonia has reported only very limited information on contamination by hazardous substances in the reporting sheet. In the paper report, they have provided more information on synthetic and non-synthetic substances. Estonia mentions the monitoring of the 33 priority substances and 16 additional substances relevant for Estonian waters. It lists the various frameworks under which it carries out this monitoring, including the Water Framework Directive and HELCOM (COMBINE and Pollution Load Compilation).  

The synthetic substances assessed include phenols, alkylphenols and their ethoxylates, PAHs, volatile organic compounds, organotin compounds, PBDEs, PFOA, PFOS, etc. and they originate primarily from wastewater treatment plants of the big coastal cities. Measures have been made in the water, in biota (fish) and in sediment. Estonia also mentions emissions of contaminants but does not describe the sources of contamination. It does not provide quantitative input loads but describes trends in the emission of dioxins in the past 20 years. 

The heavy metals assessed include mercury, cadmium, lead, copper and zinc and they originate primarily from rivers, industries and municipal areas. Estonia provides input loads of these substances from the various sources of contamination. It also provides quantitative trends for the emission of heavy metals. A number of past studies are quoted which analyse concentration levels against regulatory limits (e.g. the EQS). 

In terms of impacts on ecosystem components, Estonia describes mainly concentration levels in fish for human consumption (see next chapter D9) but it does not mention occurrence of specific biological effects (e.g. imposex).  

In the reporting sheet, Estonia judges the current levels of contamination by hazardous substances as acceptable (status is good) but does not explain how it reaches this conclusion. In the paper report on Articles 9 and 10, Estonia makes an assessment of the current levels of contamination for each substance included in the GES definition against regulatory levels (EQS and HELCOM standards). Out of 27 substances assessed, GES is achieved for 21. For the other 6, the status is unknown. It is not clear how Estonia has aggregated these different results to achieve the conclusion in the reporting sheet that GES is achieved for criterion 8.1.

Radionuclides
Estonia makes a detailed assessment of the level of radioactive substances in its marine waters, describing sources of natural radioactivity and sources of anthropogenic radioactivity (including nuclear power plants, nuclear testing and the Chernobyl accident). The substances assessed include 137Cs and 90Sr. It also provides a detailed description of the different sources of radioactivity in the whole Baltic Sea. Impacts on fish and other organisms are also described, along with details of the potential risks from the storage of radioactive material and potential risks to the population. The EURATOM treaty requirements are referred to and Estonia describes the monitoring of marine radioactivity in place.  

Acute pollution events
In its chapter on intentional/systematic release of substances in the marine environment, Estonia describes the release of waste from ships and port facilities and the relocation of sediment because of dredging and marine infrastructure (cables/pipelines, wind turbines, etc.) It mentions the MARPOL Convention in relation to the waste from ships. It does not describe oil pollution or oil spills at all. ";The assessment by Estonia of contamination by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered partially adequate. The assessment is concise and semi-quantitative. Sources are described only partially. Acute pollution events do not cover oil-related incidents. Impacts on ecosystem components are not described. A judgement is made on the current level of contamination on the basis of the GES definition but it is not clear how the overall aggregated conclusion that current status is good is reached. ;"- Concise and semi-quantitative assessment

Estonia;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Estonia has defined in the reporting sheet two targets and nine associated indicators for each target to cover D8. The general targets read rather as GES definitions for the two criteria of the Commission Decision 8.1 and 8.2. Each target is associated with a number of indicators that specify the substances that should be measured to assess the achievement of the target. No threshold values or baselines have been provided in the reporting sheet. 

The indicators associated with Target 24 are the same as those for Target 23 (as is the case in the GES definition). It is therefore not clear why two different targets have been defined if they are to be measured through the same standards, unless they have different threshold values but that is not specified. 

The analysis of the indicators has been done in the GES part of this chapter and will not be repeated here. All targets and indicators are state-based. Estonia has not defined any pressure-target.";The set of targets and indicators defined by Estonia to cover D8 is considered inadequate. The two targets and the indicators cover adequately the GES definition as they cover the same substances. However no threshold values are associated with these indicators, which means that it is not certain whether they are sufficient to achieve GES. In any case, it seems that the targets and indicators have not been defined to help achieve GES as they are rather an expression of GES.  No target is defined to reduce specific pressures or focusing on specific sources of contamination or ecosystem component contaminated. ;"- Rather an expression of GES than targets to help achieve GES

- No threshold values so uncertain whether they are sufficient to achieve GES

Estonia;D8;Consistency ;;"The assessment of contamination by synthetic and non-synthetic substances is consistent with the definition of GES as the same substances have been assessed and a judgement has been made on the current level of contamination using the same GES boundaries. The targets are also partially consistent with the initial assessment as they also focus on the same substances 

Estonia has not made an assessment of impacts on biological components (other than contamination of fish for human consumption) and has defined neither GES nor targets for this aspect. The same applies to acute pollution events. ";;;;
Estonia;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Estonia has defined GES for D9 at criteria level in the reporting sheet and at criteria and indicator level in the paper report. While Estonia indicates that its GES definition covers both indicators of the Commission Decision, i.e. including the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded, the threshold values proposed in the paper report are identical for the two set of indicators. No specific threshold value is proposed that would correspond to a frequency. 

In its methodology, Estonia indicates that the measures should be conducted in fish (sometimes the muscle tissue of fish) but does not seem to specify further the species that should be used for the sampling. For certain substances (e.g. cadmium or certain dioxins) it provides different values for certain fish, such as eel. 

The values correspond to the values included in Regulation 1881/2006 however Estonia does not refer directly to the Regulation in its methodology. It does refer to Regulation 1883/2006 (on dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs) and the amending regulations to Regulation 1881/2006. 


";The GES definition for D9 by Estonia is considered partially adequate. Estonia has defined GES for D9 in relation to compliance with Regulation 1881/2006 and a number of other foodstuffs-related EU regulations and directives. It specifies in its definition the contaminants that should be measured to assess achievement of GES but does not specify the species to be used for the sampling. The GES definition however covers only partially criterion 9.1 of the Commission Decision as no threshold value is proposed for indicator 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded. ;"- GES defined in relation to compliance with Regulation 1881/2006 and other foodstuffs-related EU regulations and directives

Estonia;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Estonia makes an extensive assessment of contamination of a number of fish for human consumption by hazardous substances. Its assessment focuses on synthetic substances (PAHs, TBT, HCBD, HCH, HCB, DDT, PCB, PBDE, PCDD, PCDF) and on heavy metals (cadmium, mercury, lead). The species used for the assessment are mostly the herring and the perch. These measurements made between 2008 and 2010, mostly in the framework of HELCOM, have been assessed against regulatory levels. Most concentration levels were significantly lower than the limit values in Regulation 1881/2006 apart from a number of individual measurements for cadmium, lead, organotin compounds, HCB. 

In the paper report for Articles 9 and 10, Estonia makes a judgement on the current levels of contamination of fish for human consumption in relation to GES. For all indicators (all groups of substances), Estonia assesses that GES is currently achieved (i.e. concentration levels are below regulatory thresholds). It also assess that GES is achieved for the indicator on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded but it is not clear what GES boundary is used to measure this. 

Microbial pathogens
In the paper report, the initial assessment describes the sources of microbial pathogens – urban wastewater, rainwater and wastewater from cruise ships, referring to relevant legal requirements, in particular the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. It also mentions the Bathing Water Directive requirements and the results of corresponding assessments. However, there is no clear conclusion on the current status.";The assessment of contamination of fish for human consumption by hazardous substances and microbial pathogens is considered adequate. The assessment is detailed and quantitative, looking at both types of substances and assessing levels against relevant EU standards. ;"- Detailed and quantitative assessment

Estonia;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Estonia has defined in the reporting sheet one target and four associated indicators to cover D9. The general target reads rather as a GES definition than a target defined to help achieve GES. 

The associated indicators specify the substances that should be used to assess the achievement of the target. No threshold values or baselines have been provided in the reporting sheet.  The indicators and target are therefore not considered SMART. 

The analysis of the indicators has been done in the GES part of this chapter and will not be repeated here. All targets and indicators are state-based. Estonia has not defined any pressure-target (as for D8).
";The set of target and indicators to cover D9 is considered inadequate. The achievement of the target and indicators would ensure achieving GES if the indicators for the targets have the same thresholds as the GES indicators. In any case, it seems that Estonia has not used the concept of the target/indicators as defined in Article 10 MSFD to its full extent. The target/indicators have not been defined to help achieve GES as they are effectively an expression of GES;"- Rather an expression of GES than targets to help achieve GES
- Same indicators as GES
- Lack threshold values and baselines

Estonia;D9;Consistency ;;The assessment of the current levels of contamination of fish is consistent with the GES definition since it uses the same indicators (substances and threshold values). The environmental target is also consistent with the GES definition and the initial assessment as it uses the same indicators. ;;;;
Finland;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Finland has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at descriptor and criteria level. The definition at descriptor level is a verbatim reproduction of the definition in Annex I MSFD. The definitions at criteria level are further specified; however they do not match exactly the content of the criteria in the Commission Decision. Criterion 1.2 on population size for instance is not covered by the Finnish GES definition (although criterion 1.1 refers, in a footnote, to the growth rate of populations). They cover all seven criteria of the Commission Decision. The definitions at criteria level often incorporate some of the indicators of the Commission Decision (e.g. species/habitat distribution).

It should be noted that there is a discrepancy between the paper report and the reporting sheet as the latter reports definitions for criteria 1.2 and 1.3 whereas these are not reproduced in the paper report. While criterion 1.3 can be considered to be a repetition of criterion 1.1, criterion 1.2 introduces the notion of habitat-forming species. 

The definition of criterion 1.1 is also differently worded in the paper report and the reporting sheet. The definition presented here for 1.1 is the one from the paper report as it is more complete. However, the discrepancy should be noted. 

The definition does not refer to any particular species group or habitat type. It is therefore considered that the definition applies equally to all biodiversity elements (i.e. covering all relevant species groups and both seabed and water column habitats). The definition is general, somewhat vaguely worded and a number of terms are not specific (e.g. “long-term survival”, “healthy”, “diversity is guaranteed”). Without further specification, through indicators or threshold values/baselines, the GES definition is not measurable as it is. 

Several criteria (1.1, 1.2, 1.4-1.6) refer to the “natural” or “historical” state of the species and habitats as a reference state to be reached. It seems therefore that, in these cases, the reference condition is used in the sense of prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions, free from anthropogenic influences.

In other cases (criteria 1.3 and 1.7), species and habitats should be “healthy” and diversity should be “guaranteed”, without further indication as to what is meant with this, and the use of the maritime space should not endanger them.  In this case, the introduction of the “long term” perspective and the mention of the use of the marine space introduce a notion of sustainability. In these cases, the reference state is not understood in the sense of prevailing conditions but rather as the current state from which there should be “no further decline”. 

No reference is made to the Habitats and Birds Directive or to the Water Framework Directive. The definition of GES is very qualitative and set at a high level.";The GES definition for Descriptor 1 by Finland is considered as partially adequate. Finland has defined GES at criteria level but does not cover all criteria. The definitions are quite general. Since the definition has a lack of specification, the definition is holistic and applies to all ecosystem components equally, however a number of terms need to be specified further in order to be able to assess when GES is achieved (i.e. what is meant with “healthy” or “long-term perspective”). Lastly the inclusion of a reference to the use of the maritime space introduces a notion of sustainable use. ;"- GES defined at criteria level but does not cover all criteria

Finland;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
In the reporting sheets Finland has reported on species groups and individual species, but not on functional groups. Information was provided only on two species groups for the whole Baltic Sea: birds and fish; Finland reported also separately for the Aland Sea, but only for fish. Mammals are not reported on, although seals are addressed under Article 10 targets. Finland indicates that species included in Annex II, IV and V of the Habitats Directive will be reported on in June 2013 and that wild bird species will be reported on in December 2013, in accordance to the reporting requirements of these Directives. 

The information included in the reporting sheets is mainly qualitative and covers descriptions on group condition and abundance as well as an indication of the main pressures affecting the species group and the status in relation to natural conditions. However, no trends or conclusive judgements on current status are provided. At individual species level, Finland reported on the following fish species: Sander lucioperca, Clupea harengus membras, Salmo salar, Sprattus sprattus, Salmo trutta trutta, Gadus morhua and Lampetra fluviatilis. For each of these species, Finland has provided the main pressures, trends and a judgement on the population size. 

In the paper report, Finland provides more detailed information on phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroalgae, macrozoobenthos, fish and mammals (individual species, e.g. harbour porpoise). The information is mainly qualitative and literature is often cited; nevertheless, some parameters are quantified.

HELCOM and ICES reports are systematically mentioned.

Habitats
Finland has carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the Baltic Sea. The assessment is mostly qualitative and covers a number of seabed habitats and water column habitats. The information reported by Finland is more comprehensive and developed in the paper report than in the reporting sheets. 

In the reporting sheets Finland describes its predominant habitats for five assessment areas (the Archipelago Sea, the Bay of Bothnia, the Bothnian Sea, the Gulf of Finland, the Northern Baltic Proper and the Quark), which include a single seabed habitat type – shelf sublittoral mixed sediment – and a single water column habitat type – reduced salinity water. It is not clear whether the seabed habitat type is meant to address the entire seafloor, or whether other habitat types occur in Finnish waters but have not been reported. For each of these habitats, the assessment includes the main pressures and a judgement on current status; for shelf sublittoral mixed sediment a trend is also provided. Other individual habitats (e.g. hydrolittoral filamentous algal communities, seagrass beds or bladderwrack communities), from the HELCOM list of protected habitats, are also reported on but only the main pressures for each of these habitats are listed.

In the paper report Finland reports additionally on a series of other habitats, which include some special habitats listed under the Habitats Directive, namely, sandbanks (1110), estuaries (1130), coastal lagoons (1150), large shallow inlets and bays (1160), reefs (1170), Baltic esker islands (1610), boreal Baltic islets and small islands (1620) and boreal Baltic narrow inlets (1650). The assessment includes a brief description of each habitat, a map with the geographic distribution, the main pressures, trends and judgements.

HELCOM reports are mentioned throughout the report.

Ecosystems
Finland has not reported on ecosystems.

In its paper report on Article 9 and 10, Finland reports that many Natura 2000 areas of natural habitats and species are in unfavourable status or declining and a number of areas are considered at risk because of growing pressures. Species abundance is reduced and the whole Finnish marine biodiversity is deteriorated. Based on HELCOM biodiversity status assessment (2003-2007), 82% of the Finnish coast is declared to be in less than good status for biodiversity. In its letter to the Commission in response to the completeness check, Finland confirms that GES is not considered to be achieved for D1 and D4. ";The initial assessment by Finland of biological features is considered partially adequate. Only two predominant habitat types and a number of special habitats are reported. Species groups are generally better covered. Although the information reported is mostly qualitative and not very detailed, some parameters are quantified. Judgements on status were only provided in some cases. Reference is made to HELCOM, ICES and to the Habitats Directive. ;"Features:

Finland;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has defined ten targets for Descriptor 1, which cover all the main biodiversity components and are consistent as a set. The targets and associated indicators are sufficient to cover all the criteria and indicators as provided in the Commission Decision for descriptor 1. 

The associated indicators provided for target 9 relate to indicator 6.2.2 as provided for Descriptor 6 in the Commission Decision.  The targets also make use of existing EU legislation such as the Habitats and Birds Directives and the Water Framework Directive as well as agreements made within HELCOM. The targets (or threshold values in the reporting sheet) also refer to international agreements such as IUCN and the CBD and the WWF is also mentioned. Protected/listed species are fully covered and MPAs are addressed by target 10.

Most targets are state-targets. Only some targets/indicators address pressures and it is limited to the fishing pressure (catches and by-catch). 

It should be noted that the classification used for habitats is the EU EUNIS classification and not the MSFD classification.

However the targets all lack a time-perspective and most lack reference to target states, baselines and thresholds. Most targets are potentially measurable, through their associated indicators, but the lack of threshold values means that they are not SMART. The exception is target 7, which is the most SMART of the set since it uses WFD indicators, however the WFD indicators do not address the distribution aspect of the target. The targets as they are currently defined are too imprecise to know if they are sufficient to achieve GES by 2020. 

Lastly some of the targets are also relevant for Descriptor 6, in particular targets 7 and 9.






";The Finnish targets covering Descriptor 1 are considered partially adequate. The targets address all the main biodiversity components and make use of existing EU legislation and agreements made in HELCOM. The targets however lack thresholds, baselines, reference states and other attributes that make them SMART with the exception of target 7.

The assessment of physical pressures and biological features is consistent with the GES definitions, considering that these are defined at a high level and that the initial assessment is mostly qualitative. 

The initial assessment and the targets for Descriptor 1 reference thoroughly to HELCOM but this is scarcer for the targets for Descriptors 4 and 6 (only as reference values for a limited number of indicators). Almost all targets are defined generally and lack quantification and attributes that make them SMART and implementable. The indicators are much more specific and adapted to the circumstances of the Finnish marine waters. Some of them have threshold values and baselines, which make them SMART, but the majority are still under development. ";;;;
Finland;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Finland has defined GES at descriptor and criteria levels. The definition at descriptor level is a verbatim copy of the definition in Annex I MSFD. The Finnish definition at criteria level includes elements of the criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision, yet only the impact to marine life is specifically mentioned. 

Specific reference to marine litter on the beach, seabed and water column (criterion 10.1) is not provided although the three matrices are covered at a high level by the definition. 

In addition, Finland includes in its GES definition elements not included in the Commission Decision. First of all, the entry of new litter is also covered, besides the collection of existing litter. The Finnish GES definition also mentions the socio-economic impacts of marine litter on marine economic activities and the harm to the ecosystem from chemical contamination associated with marine litter.

Finland;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the reporting sheet, Finland only provides very limited information, mostly related to the level of pressure in, and impact on, the water column and the water surface. The information provided is based on quantitative trends but the information is not clear. 

Finland discusses the origin of the debris (40% from Russia and the Baltic countries, 21% from Poland). It then provides an assessment of the sources of marine litter, mentioning that marine litter in the Baltic Sea region is most commonly associated with human recreation, commercial shipping and tourism activities. It also assesses that debris from fishing operations were abundant throughout the Baltic Sea.  However, Finland reports that there is no statistics-based information on waste volumes for the Baltic Sea coast. 

In terms of impacts, Finland refers to interference in the food web by degradable plastic waste from the microscopic particles.

The information provided by Finland is limited. It justifies this by stating that there is insufficient data and no method developed to make a systematic assessment of the current status in relation to marine litter. No additional information is provided on data gaps and no information on future plans to address these gaps is mentioned. Finland only mentions that the situation is not as bad as in the ocean, but does not provide data to support this statement. 

In the paper report, the information reported is once again mostly qualitative but a number of quantitative trends are provided. The information reported covers the coastal and offshore areas. There is also information reported on microparticles and impacts of marine litter on marine animals and the marine economy. The figures provided by Finland come from the WWF and are mostly about the Estonian coast. 

In the paper report on Article 9 and 10, Finland refers again to WWF projects and concludes that while marine litter in the Baltic is not as big a problem as in the ocean, degradation of plastic has increased, causing serious problems to birds and mammals. It does not provide a conclusive judgement on whether status is good or not in relation to GES. In its letter following the completeness check, Finland confirms that no assessment of current status has been made in relation to D10 because of the lack of knowledge.";The assessment by Finland of the pressure from marine litter is considered inadequate.

Finland;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has set two targets and three associated indicators to cover D10. One target relates to the reduction of existing marine litter on the shore and one the seabed. The two associated indicators are focused on the quantities of litter on the shore and on the seafloor but they are not quantified either by a reduction trend or by a limit value to reach. No baseline has been defined either. Finland mentions that the two indicators will be operational by 2014, which is why there is a lack of specification. This means that the target, while potentially measurable, is not fully SMART.

The second target aims to reducing the entry of new marine litter in the marine environment of inhabited areas in the archipelago, from land and sea-based sources. It proposes that waste from communities, tourism and ports is collected. The “no special fee” system explicitly referred to in the target has been agreed within HELCOM to facilitate the collection of shipping waste. The target has one associated indicator on the quantity of marine litter. But as for the other two indicators, it is not quantified and is reported to be operational only by 2014. The target is therefore not fully SMART either.

The target refers to impacts, but no indicator has been set to address the impacts of litter on marine life. No target has been defined on micro-plastics.";The set of targets and indicators defined by Finland to cover D10 is considered inadequate.

Finland;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Finland has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor and criteria levels in the reporting sheets and in the paper report. 

The definition at descriptor level is a copy of the definition of the MSFD. Both criteria laid out for Descriptor 11 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated in the first criterion of the Finnish GES. However, the Finnish text is too unspecific and no clear distinction is made between impulsive and continuous sound. The Finnish GES refers to natural noise levels as the baseline that should not be exceeded, however Finland has not defined what it means with natural noise levels and this is not defined by external standards.  

In addition to noise, Finland has included a specific criterion on temperature changes but it is qualitative, as no threshold value has been defined to specify what is meant with “local” or “alter harmfully”. ";The GES definition of Finland for D11 is assessed as inadequate. Finland has defined GES at descriptor and criteria levels following the logic of the 2010 Commission Decision. However, the definition is not specific enough and there is no distinction made between impulsive and continuous sound.

Finland;D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Finland has carried out an initial assessment for Descriptor 11. In the reporting sheets Finland used four assessment areas and reported little information. A very brief description of the level of pressure and/or the level of impacts is presented, but no quantitative information, trends or conclusive judgements on the current status are provided. For the Sea of Aland, ports are indicated as the main source of pressure. The information provided is very generic and there is little difference in the text between 11.1.1 and 11.2.1 (e.g. shipping is mentioned under 11.1.1). 

The only information reported concerning knowledge gaps and plans to address is related to lack of funding for specific assessment in the Sea of Aland. In the paper report, the information reported is also very generic, however, a map describing the impact level of noise 2003-2007, based on a HELCOM assessment is provided. The work of the MSFD Technical Group for underwater noise is mentioned.

In the paper report on Article 9 and 10, Finland explains that it is not possible to assess the current level of, and impacts from, noise. For heat, it mentions that the effects are local. In its letter following the completeness check, Finland confirms that no assessment of current status has been made in relation to D11 because of the lack of knowledge.";The initial assessment of Finland for the introduction of energy is assessed as partially adequate.

The target tackling underwater noise is rather broad but the two associated indicators are in line with the indicators of the 2010 Commission Decision. The target tackling the introduction of heat is rather specific. The targets are sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of a specified pressure, at least in the long run. The targets and indicators should supply information on the distribution of the pressures, which is a necessary first step in achieving GES.

On the other hand, the targets do not seem to be sufficient to achieve GES as the GES definition is ambitious and uses natural noise levels as a reference while Target 38 uses harm to marine organisms as a reference.

Finland;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Finland has set GES definition at descriptor and criteria level. At descriptor level, the definition is the same as the definition set in the MSFD Annex I. At criteria level, the reporting sheet indicates that the single definition provided applies to both criteria 2.1 and 2.2. There seems to be some confusion as the definition focuses on impacts, while the first criteria should be on abundance and the second on impact.

The definition does not reflect the minimum requirements (‘no further increase of NIS). In addition, there is no indication of baseline or reference conditions. ‘Natural habitats’ could be considered as reference conditions.";The GES definition for D2 is considered as inadequate.

Finland;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Finland provided an inventory of NIS for the six assessment areas, as follows:
•	Archipelago: 21 species
•	Bay of Bothnia: 14 species
•	Bothnian Sea: 14 species
•	Gulf of Finland: 25 species
•	Northern Baltic proper: 6 species
•	Quark: 12 species

For each species, Finland indicates the relevant predominant habitat/functional group and means of arrival, No inventory has been provided for the Sea of Aaland.

The paper report indicates a figure of 33 invasive species in Finland’s territorial waters, 26 of which are well established (section on Article 8). In another part of the paper report (section on Articles 9 and 10) and the reporting sheet, these figures amount to 34 invasive species including 27 established. In the letter sent by Finland in response to the completeness check, it indicates 27 NIS established in Finnish marine area of which seven are classified as harmful. Hence, the exact numbers are rather uncertain.

In the reporting sheet, the remaining information on NIS is similar for all regions except for the Sea of Aaland. The main causes for the pressure are identified as shipping (50%) and aquaculture (25%), as well as introduction through waterways. There is no assessment of the level of the pressure and the impacts in the reporting sheet only indicates that only a part of the 27 established NIS are ‘causing harm to the original species, ecosystem functioning or directly to humans’.  However, the paper report provides some data on abundance and distribution of NIS but recognises that there is no comprehensive information in the current state of knowledge.

There is no detailed description of information gaps and plans to address them, although Finland refers to some of the work undertaken under HELCOM e.g. on introduction vectors/pathways. 
";The initial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered partially adequate. Finland has provided a list of NIS (although there are some uncertainties as to the number of NIS and invasive NIS) and identified the main vectors.

Finland;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has reported one environmental target with eight associated indicators. The first part of the target is not specific as it is worded in a very general way and expresses rather GES than an environmental target. The second part of the target is specific as it relates to a particular impact, namely those from non-indigenous mammal species on important bird areas in the archipelago.

The target is measurable, especially in conjunction with use of biopollution indices for assessment. The target is difficult to achieve and not bound by any timeframe. In particular, the deadline for reaching the intermediate goal (slowing down the introduction rate) is not specified. The target is considered as ambitious, subject to specifying the timeline. Without being time-bound, it is not linked to the 2020 limit date.

The indicators are very comprehensive and address both status and vectors/pathways of introduction. For two of the indicators, Finland indicated a ‘threshold value’. For introduction of new NIS (D2.1.1), it refers to a ‘decreasing trend’ using the current level as the baseline. This is less ambitious than the target itself of ‘no new introduction’, it requires a decreasing trend compared to the current level. For ‘change in the abundance of established NIS’ (D2.1.2), the threshold value is ‘decreasing trend’, with the same baseline – current level. This implies control over further spreading of existing NIS. It specifically includes the current pressure of NIS and the reduction of this already existing pressure.

Other indicators are specific to certain vectors/pathways (ballast waters, threat by invasive mammals in relation to birds). One indicator reflects indicator 2.2.1 of the Commission Decision i.e. the ratio between invasive NIS and native species. For this indicator, Finland mentions that this ratio should not increase. Finally, one indicator is linked to the result of an assessment based on biopollution indices, in line with the HELCOM approach.

Finland indicates that some indicators are due to be operational in 2014 others in 2018, while the two first ones which are worded more as GES, are fully operational.";The environmental target and associated indicators are considered as partially adequate to achieve GES, which is itself defined in a rather vague way. The target is not fully SMART. It could however be considered as ambitious subject to specifying the timeline. Associated indicators are very specific and tailored to the national circumstances.

It is nevertheless a comprehensive set of indicators.

Finland;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Finland has defined GES at the descriptor and criteria level. All three criteria of the Commission Decision have been applied. For criterion 3.1, Finland has only applied the primary indicator F as provided in the Commission Decision and requires that all commercially-exploited species are exploited at or below Fmsy which is in line with the Commission Decision. 

In defining criterion 3.2, Finland has made use of the primary indicator SSB 3.2.1, however it states that there should be enough SSB to secure normal reproduction. This is not sufficiently specific to ensure that the SSB of stocks should not be below SSBpa reference points. At descriptor level, by providing a verbatim copy of the Annex I definition of Descriptor 3, the Finnish GES definition requires that all commercially exploited stocks are within safe biological limits which can be understood as being at or above PA levels and is therefore in line with guidance from the Commission.  The criterion also refers to maintaining sufficient spawning areas for the preservation of migratory fish species without restocking activities. Lastly Finland has not made use of the secondary indicator 3.2.2 biomass indices. 

Criterion 3.3 is defined in a way that incorporates various aspects from the Commission Decision but the interpretation of the criterion could potentially deviate from guidance from the Commission. As guidance on criterion 3.3 is further developed at EU level, it will have to be assessed whether the Finnish definition is in line with those developments.";The Finnish GES definition is considered adequate. The Finnish GES definition requires that no stocks are exploited above Fmsy and requires that all stocks remain within safe biological limits. Furthermore criterion 3.3 has been further defined. ;"- Requires all stocks to be exploited at or below Fmsy

Stocks have not been assessed in relation to Fmsy or PA reference points. No judgement on the level of pressure is made and no assessment of fishery impacts is provided. In the letter provided to the Commission following the completeness check, Finland explains that good status has been achieved for some individual stocks (herring – except in Bothnian Sea – and sprat) but in other cases a positive trend needs to continue in order to achieve GES (e.g. salmon) while for a third group, more data is needed to make an assessment (e.g. perch, pikeperch, whiting, etc.).

Finland;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has defined three targets to cover D3. The Finnish targets are generally specified towards certain species or certain types of fish stocks. The targets address what seem to be the most important species for Finnish waters but not all, and in particular not flatfish. There is no target that addresses all DCF stocks in general.

Targets 12 and 13 aim not to exploit certain species above Fmsy, but do not apply to all species. Target 14 ensures that sufficient numbers of Salmon are able to reach spawning sites and reproduce in order to maintain their populations while target 16 deals with maintaining the reproductive capacity of important coastal fish. There are no targets for maintaining the reproductive capacity of the marine species such as cod, herring and sprat. The targets are therefore insufficiently ambitious to achieve the objectives of the MSFD for all stocks to be exploited at or below Fmsy and for all stocks to be within safe biological limits. Lastly not all targets are fully measurable and they are not time bound. ";The Finnish targets are partially adequate. The targets aim for stocks to not be exploited above Fmsy and to maintain the reproductive capacity of various stocks as measured by certain fish stock attributes but are not time bound.

The Descriptor 3 text is a verbatim copy of the Annex I MSFD text but the remaining GES texts and the targets do not always reflect the ambition of this text that all commercially exploited fish and shellfish stocks should be within safe biological limits. Finland has however addressed diadromous, coastal and marine species but not all. ";;;;
Finland;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Finland has defined Descriptor 4 at descriptor and criteria level. The descriptor is a verbatim copy of the descriptor as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. 

Neither criterion 4.1 nor criterion 4.2 is defined in a way that corresponds to the concepts of the criteria as defined in the Commission decision, which are productivity and the proportion of species at the top of the food web. In fact, both criteria really address criterion 4.3 on abundance. 

Criterion 4.3 is defined so that it applies to the composition of the phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure which is relevant for addressing groups with fast turnover rates but not the other groups that are proposed for criterion 4.3 in the Commission Decision. Furthermore the criterion states that the composition of phyto- and zooplankton communities should be stable. This could refer to the lack of sudden shifts in community structure but could also imply that the current situation is the baseline which would be in conflict with the initial assessment that finds eutrophication problems at several locations in Finnish waters. In addition, it does not allow for any potential needs of ecosystem/climate change adaptations. 

No threshold values or baselines are provided which would allow to make this GES definition measurable. Finland refers to “natural” abundance but it is not certain whether this refers to a past or present state. ";Taking into account that D4 requires unfamiliar assessment approaches, Descriptor 4 is considered partially adequate. The definition at criteria level mostly addresses criterion 4.3 of the Commission Decision. Criteria 4.1 and 4.2 are not really covered by the GES definition.

In its paper report on Article 9 and 10, Finland reports that many Natura 2000 areas of natural habitats and species are in unfavourable status or declining and a number of areas are considered at risk because of growing pressures. Species abundance is reduced and the whole Finnish marine biodiversity is deteriorated. Based on HELCOM biodiversity status assessment (2003-2007), 82% of the Finnish coast is declared to be in less than good status for biodiversity. In its letter to the Commission in response to the completeness check, Finland confirms that GES is not considered to be achieved for D1 and D4. ";Not reported.;- Not reported;0;Not reported
Finland;D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has defined four targets and a number of associated indicators to cover Descriptor 4. The targets are relatively coherent as a set, and cover both benthic and water column habitats in relation to food webs. 

The targets are well related to guidance from the Commission Decision for criterion 4.3. Groups/species at the top of the food chain are covered by target 17 and its indicators for seals and white tailed eagles. The groups/species tightly linked to specific groups/species at another trophic level are covered by the targets for birds with specific types of food preferences (herring and sprat, coastal fish, mussels). Finally long distance diadromous fish are covered through the indicator related to the mortality rates of salmon smolts. The species selected by Finland in their targets (seals, white-tailed eagle, birds feeding on herring/sprat/mussels/coastal fish, etc.) are appropriate considering their predator status.

Targets 18 and 20, along with their indicators, cover habitat defining groups/species by relating to benthic communities and fish communities. Target 19 and its associated indicators cover groups with fast turnover rates. All trophic levels are addressed by the targets for Descriptor 4.

Most targets and indicators however lack thresholds, baselines, target states and links with current states. In the reporting sheets, a few indicators of Target 17 have a threshold value (reported as HELCOM class limits) but it is limited. The targets are therefore not fully measurable. Furthermore all targets read more like GES statements than targets designed to help achieve GES. ";The Finnish targets for Descriptor 4 are considered to be between partially adequate and adequate.

Almost all targets are defined generally and lack quantification and attributes that make them SMART and implementable. The indicators are much more specific and adapted to the circumstances of the Finnish marine waters. Some of them have threshold values and baselines, which make them SMART, but the majority are still under development. ";;;;
Finland;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Finland has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor and criteria levels both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report. All criteria laid out for Descriptor 5 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated and most indicators are indirectly addressed. For criterion 5.1, the GES definition covers indicator 5.1.1, but not indicator 5.1.2 (nutrient ratios); for criterion 5.2, all indicators are covered to some extent, but indicators 5.2.3 (abundance of opportunistic macroalgae) and 5.2.4 (species shifts in floristic composition) could have been more explicitly included; for criterion 5.3, indicator 5.3.1 (abundance of perennial seaweed and seagrasses) is also only loosely covered by the third definition. It should be noted that even though the Finnish definition of GES for eutrophication does not address shifts in floristic composition, abundance of opportunistic macroalgae, perennial seaweeds and seagrasses, it does consider the depth of colonisation of benthic macroalgae. 

There is an attempt to match GES determination to the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal marine waters as threshold values from the WFD are referred to in the accompanying text to the definition (but not actually provided). Likewise, there is a mention of HELCOM thresholds but without providing any further details. The adaptation of the HEAT assessments is currently under discussion amongst HELCOM states to make future eutrophication assessments compliant with MSFD requirements. The HELCOM HEAT approach, however, appears to cover far fewer impacts than those which will be included in the Finnish approach when the environmental targets are achieved (see below).";The GES definition of Finland for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. GES is not a copy or simple reformulation of the MSFD and covers all the three criteria.

The assessment is based on existing information and the level of detail varies depending on the area or parameter assessed. 
The assessment covers loads and concentrations of the relevant nutrients – nitrogen and phosphorus – as well of organic matter. The main causes of pressure are listed and include agriculture, forestry, urban discharges and industry. Conclusive judgements on the level of pressure made by reference to HELCOM and the WFD thresholds are also provided where the information is available (not good in all cases, except for the level of nitrogen in the Bay of Bothnia). Only in a very few cases are trends provided. 

The assessment also includes (mainly qualitative) information on the impacts of eutrophication in both water column and seabed habitats.

Finland;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has defined four targets and sets of associated indicators to address Descriptor 5. The targets are the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report and are applicable to all Finnish waters. 

All targets appear to be measureable. Those aimed at impacts are very specific, whilst those aimed at pressures are less so. Organic matter is not tackled, only nutrient loads and concentrations, with quantitative values for achievement. An assessment of the achievability and realism of some targets will remain unknown until those indicators (and thresholds) are developed by 2014 or 2018. However, some of these are more detailed than those proposed under the MSFD and the 2010 Commission Decision – e.g. the 2010 Commission Decision refers to abundance of opportunistic macroalgae (indicator 5.2.3), but two of the indicators to be developed for Target 24 are ‘the number and extent of sandy beaches overgrown by reed’ and ‘the length of filamentous algae.’ No timescales are provided for the achievement of any of the targets. 

Targets 23 and 24 (achievement of impact thresholds) are highly focused on specific impacts. Targets 21 and 22 (achievement of pressure thresholds) are less focused with regard to individual sources or vectors of entry of nutrients, but they are aimed at compliance with existing targets under the WFD and HELCOM BSAP. It is not clear whether the set of targets is ambitious enough to achieve GES as this will largely depend on the stringency of nutrient reduction targets already in place to achieve WFD GES in coastal waters and comply with the Baltic Sea Action Plan. These should enable GES to be achieved in terms of measureable pressures (notably river nutrient and organic loads, as well as atmospheric deposition).

The targets are consistent in terms of the range of individual impacts they cover, but could be more specific with regard to individual pressures (sources or vectors of entry). Conflict could arise because targets 22, 23 and 24 have so many indicators (e.g. what happens if the threshold values for one indicator are surpassed, but another fails to achieve the threshold for the same target?), but the alternative argument that the greater the number of metrics, the greater the certainty of the result also holds true. The outcome will depend on how the results of the various indicators are aggregated. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Finland for D5 is assessed as adequate. The set of targets tackles both impacts and pressures, and all are measurable. Threshold values are available for the target tackling nutrient loads and concentrations and Targets 23 and 24 refer to WFD and/or HELCOM thresholds. However, since some indicators have still to be developed, a slight question mark remains over these, albeit that the additional indicators should increase the certainty associated with achievement of the target. There is a good link with the WFD and using the HELCOM BSAP targets is considered a good practice. Based on available knowledge, the targets appear comprehensive and ambitious enough to achieve GES. ;"- The set of targets tackles both impacts and pressures, and all are measurable

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 covers all impacts, and embraces all pressures identified in the initial assessment; even it fails to distinguish between individual pressures. 

The targets should lead to a reduction in nutrient loading and nutrient concentrations in marine waters, possibly reducing chlorophyll levels and improving water transparency. It is unclear whether the frequency or severity of harmful algal blooms would be reduced; pressures from organic loading may not be reduced. Providing that the WFD targets currently in place for coastal waters and the HELCOM targets for open waters are stringent enough then GES should be achieved. However, oxygen status in bottom waters is dependent on hydrological/meteorological conditions as well as sources and loads of organic carbon. ";;;;
Finland;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Descriptor 6 has been defined at the descriptor and criteria level. The descriptor is a verbatim copy of the descriptor as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. The Criteria are defined in more detail than those provided in the Commission Decision but lack baselines and thresholds. 

While Criteria 6.1 states that the level of human pressure should assure the structure and functioning of the ecosystems, the requirement that there are no harmful impacts caused to the benthic ecosystems would according to a strict interpretation imply a ban of virtually all human activities affecting the seafloor as all these impacts are likely to cause a harmful impact. Furthermore there is no reference to biogenic substrate affected by human activities.

Criterion 6.2 requires that the functioning of the benthic community and the species richness and diversity are not endangered. The use of the word functioning could imply a different focus than the word “condition” as used in the Commission Decision.

Finland has carried out a limited initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage for the Baltic Sea. In relation to physical loss Finland has used four assessment areas: the Archipelago Sea, the Bay of Bothnia, the Sea of Aland and the Baltic Sea. In the reporting sheets, for each assessment area, a very short description on the level and impact of pressure is provided; for the Sea of Aland the main causes of pressure are also listed. The information on the paper report is more detailed and the quantification of a few parameters is provided. No conclusive judgements are reported. 

The information on physical damage is more complete. In the reporting sheets Finland has used six assessment areas: the Archipelago Sea, the Bay of Bothnia, the Bothnian Sea, the Gulf of Finland, the Sea of Aland and the Baltic Sea. For each assessment area, a very short description on the level and impact of pressure is provided, as are, in most cases, judgements and trends on the level of pressure and impacts. Like for physical loss, the information is more detailed in the paper report, which focuses on changes in siltation, erosion, construction of structures and shipping. 

Reference is made to HELCOM and other international agreements throughout the report. 

In its letter to the Commission in response to the completeness check, Finland reports that direct human impacts to the seafloor (e.g. from dredging, trawling) are considered to be only local, while indirect impacts, such as eutrophication, have more widespread impacts. It does not conclude however whether GES is considered to be achieved in relation to Descriptor 6.

In the reporting sheets Finland describes its predominant habitats for five assessment areas (the Archipelago Sea, the Bay of Bothnia, the Bothnian Sea, the Gulf of Finland, the Northern Baltic Proper and the Quark), which include a single seabed habitat type – shelf sublittoral mixed sediment – and a single water column habitat type – reduced salinity water. It is not clear whether the seabed habitat type is meant to address the entire seafloor, or whether other habitat types occur in Finnish waters but have not been reported. For each of these habitats, the assessment includes the main pressures and a judgement on current status; for shelf sublittoral mixed sediment a trend is also provided. Other individual habitats (e.g. hydrolittoral filamentous algal communities, seagrass beds or bladderwrack communities), from the HELCOM list of protected habitats, are also reported on but only the main pressures for each of these habitats are listed.

In the paper report Finland reports additionally on a series of other habitats, which include some special habitats listed under the Habitats Directive, namely, sandbanks (1110), estuaries (1130), coastal lagoons (1150), large shallow inlets and bays (1160), reefs (1170), Baltic esker islands (1610), boreal Baltic islets and small islands (1620) and boreal Baltic narrow inlets (1650). The assessment includes a brief description of each habitat, a map with the geographic distribution, the main pressures, trends and judgements.

HELCOM reports are mentioned throughout the report.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Finland;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has defined two targets and five associated indicators to cover Descriptor 6. The targets for Descriptor 6 are close approximations of the GES definitions for criteria 6.1 and 6.2. 

Neither the targets nor the indicators contain baselines and thresholds. Therefore none are fully SMART, although some are potentially measurable. The second indicator of target 26, referring to the index on the geological stability of the seabed, is not specific enough and does not contain specific reference values, which means that it is not possible to know when the target is achieved. The BBI index however is an already operational indicator under the WFD and is therefore measurable.

There are however targets reported for descriptor 1 which are relevant for Descriptor 6 in particular target 7, which corresponds to criterion 6.2 of the Commission Decision on the condition of the benthic community and more specifically indicator 6.2.2. The associated indicator for target 7 makes use of the BBI of the WFD and is therefore SMART as it requires the current situation to at least remain stable.  

There is no reference to HELCOM in the targets but the indicator on the BBI index makes a link with the WFD. ";The targets for descriptor 6 are considered partially adequate. The targets specific for Descriptor 6 are more appropriate as GES statements and lack baselines and thresholds and are therefore not SMART or sufficient to achieve GES by 2020.

The assessment of physical pressures and biological features is consistent with the GES definitions, considering that these are defined at a high level and that the initial assessment is mostly qualitative. 

The initial assessment and the targets for Descriptor 1 reference thoroughly to HELCOM but this is scarcer for the targets for Descriptors 4 and 6 (only as reference values for a limited number of indicators). Almost all targets are defined generally and lack quantification and attributes that make them SMART and implementable. The indicators are much more specific and adapted to the circumstances of the Finnish marine waters. Some of them have threshold values and baselines, which make them SMART, but the majority are still under development. ";;;;

In the reporting sheets the assessment covers only the Åland islands but in the paper report the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia are also covered. The information is very general and focuses on changes in temperature and in salinity, describing the main pressures and impacts.  

There is no conclusive judgement on the current status of Finnish waters in relation to the level of pressure of and impacts from permanent hydrographical changes but it is reported that the effects are mostly local and mainly due to climate change. There is no explicit reference to the WFD reports or to HELCOM HOLAS (although reports by HELCOM from 2007 are mentioned). Marine acidification is also briefly mentioned. The main causes of pressure are identified and it is reported that, at least for the Gulf of Bothnia, the loads of acidifying substances have decreased markedly since the 1970s.

In the paper report on Article 9 and 10, Finland only provides a summary of its assessment, mostly focused on the types of changes observed in the Baltic Sea and the various assessment areas. It does not conclude on the current level of the pressure. In the letter to the Commission following the completeness check, Finland states that the current status with regard to D7 is considered to be good, since human impacts on hydrography and hydrology are only local. It is not certain what the basis is for this judgement is (i.e. local developments/constructions could anyway affect wave action/ currents/ water exchange).

Finland;D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has defined on environmental target and three associated indicators to address Descriptor 7. The target and indicators reported are the same in reporting sheets and in the paper report. The environmental target and the indicators are very similar, and consistent, with the GES definition. It actually reads more like an expression of GES than a target. The target is somehow specific (in the sense that it is targeted to well-defined parameters) but it is not measurable (some relevant indicators for state are defined but they are not associated to a reference value, space or time scale). 

The target is very ambitious – “salinity is kept naturally intact” – but probably not realistic. Three of the indicators reported are state indicators on salinity changes, temperature changes, and stratification changes. The indicator on the effects of hydrographical condition on habitats will be developed by 2018; in addition this indicator is not specific enough as some of its elements are not clearly defined. The target does not cover all the parameters included in the GES definition but seems to focus on the most important ones. No justification is provided as to why not all GES parameters are covered by the target.

It is not clear if the target reported will be sufficient to achieve GES.;;;;
Finland;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Finland has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at the level of the descriptor and the criteria. The definition by Finland covers the two criteria of the Commission Decision but cannot be considered to cover the indicators properly. 

Concentration of contaminants

The definition of GES for the concentration of contaminants requires that concentrations of synthetic contaminants are “at levels that do not cause direct or indirect negative impacts on sensitive marine organisms or to species at the top of the food web”. Concentrations should be measured in water or in biota. Measurement in sediment is not included in the scope of the GES definition. 

The definition at criteria level is so general that it could potentially cover compliance with the EQS Directive (and other standards) for all relevant substances but this is an interpretation, the definition is not specific enough. The definition does not refer to the EQS Directive nor to the Water Framework Directive, which is why it is not considered that indicator 8.1.1 is covered. No information is provided on the substances addressed by the definition. 

Effects of contaminants

For effects of contaminants, the GES definition for criterion 8.2 specifies that negative impacts should not take place at the individual level nor at any level in the food web, thus providing a holistic approach to the prevention of contamination of ecosystem components. It provides a good list of types of negative effects on organisms but does not provide a list of measurable biological effects (e.g. lysomal membrane stability) that would be considered to assess GES. 

The definition at criterion level does not mention acute pollution events or pollution by oil. It could be considered that oil is one of the “contaminants” referred to in the definition and that effects of oil on marine organisms are broadly covered by the definition but even so the first part of indicator 8.2.2 on the occurrence of acute pollution events is not at all addressed. ";The GES definition for D8 by Finland is considered inadequate. GES is defined at criteria level, and the two criteria of the Commission Decision, concentration and effects of contaminants, are covered. However the definition does not cover all relevant elements of the Commission Decision (e.g. acute pollution events are not addressed). The definition is very general and does not refer to any standards, which would allow to measure GES (and in particular there is no reference to the EQS Directive or the WFD). The GES definition does not meet the minimum requirements as the definition for 8.1 does not refer to relevant regulatory levels.;"- GES defined at criteria level and both criteria covered
- No reference to any standards (e.g. EQS or HELCOM standards) to make it measurable
- No coverage of indicator 8.2.2";1;Inadequate
Finland;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Finland provides a relatively detailed and semi-quantitative report of contamination of the marine environment by hazardous substances. The information from the reporting sheet is relatively limited but more detailed information is provided in the paper report. Sources of contamination are described in the paper report, referring to industrial activities, municipal pollution and agriculture. No information on input load is provided in the reporting sheet but some information is provided in the paper report, mostly based on the information provided in the HELCOM BSAP.

Finland also provides a list of the substances assessed, including PCBs, DDT, HCB, HCH, PBDEs, HBCD, PFOS, PFOA, PAHs for man-made substances and mercury, cadmium, lead, copper and zinc for heavy metals. 

For synthetic substances, Finland provides a detailed account of the concentrations of certain pollutants (in particular PBDE, PCDD/F, PCBs, PFOs) in certain fish species (herring, salmon and sea trout) in various marine areas of Finland. It also provides a number of graphs on the levels of PCBs, DDTs and mercury in young herrings over time in the various marine areas of Finland. In the reporting sheet, Finland assesses that 75-100% of the functional groups are affected by contamination (by bioaccumulation). It also provides an assessment of contamination by TBT in sediments and mentions that high concentrations have been measured in coastal areas. In the reporting sheet, Finland reports that concentrations in PCDD have decreased since the 1970s but still assess that 75-100% of its assessment area (Baltic Proper) is affected by contamination. 

For heavy metals, Finland mentions that rivers are a major contributor to the input of heavy metals in the marine waters. It provides graphs showing the evolution between 1995 and 2008 of the concentrations of heavy metals in rivers. While there is a clear decreasing trend in 2001-2003, it increased again from 2005 to reach even higher levels than before. It also provides input loads from air-based sources for the period 2001-2006 for Ni, Pb, Cd and Hg.

In terms of judgement, Finland refers to HELCOM’s 2010 assessment (HELCOM HOLAS) and the classification of the Baltic waters according to their status (poor, satisfactory, good, high). The Finnish waters are classified mostly as satisfactory or poor (for metals). The Sea of Aland is classified as good and the waters of the Archipelago are in the highest class. However, Finland mentions that this assessment is based on limited data, which does not take into account point sources (e.g. harbours). The standards used for this judgement are the HELCOM standards. The EQS Directive is referred to only once in the paper report to explain that concentrations of TBT are exceeded in a number of areas (coastal waters, harbours and shipyards, etc.). It is also mentioned in the paper report for Article 9 and 10 when Finland assesses that concentrations of certain synthetic substances (HCB and HCBD) are well below limit values. In the reporting sheet, Finland makes a judgement that the level of pressure on functional groups from both synthetic and non-synthetic substances is not acceptable (status is not good). It does not specify which standard/method it uses to make this judgement and it is not supported in the paper report.

Finally, in the letter to the Commission following the completeness check, Finland confirms that it considers that GES has not been achieved for D8.

Radionuclides
Finland reports in quite some details on radioactive contamination. It looks mainly at 137Cs. In terms of sources, Finland mentions the Chernobyl accident as being the most important source of artificial contamination by radionuclides (82% of 137Cs originate from the accident). Nuclear testing is reported as the second-most important source. Finland assesses that levels in sediment are today 20 times higher than pre-Chernobyl levels and in the water 2-3 times higher than the target value.  

Acute pollution events
Finland provides almost no information on contamination by acute pollution events in the reporting sheet. In the paper report Finland describes oil pollution, its sources (accidental or voluntary release of oil from ships, municipal and industrial waste water, etc.) and the level of pollution by releases or accidents over the past 15 years. Finland mentions that overall oil concentrations in the water have decreased and have remained below the thresholds defined by the IOC. It does not discuss the impacts of oil on ecosystem components. It does not make a judgement on the current level of pressure. 

Finland also describes the concentrations in sediment and functional groups of a number of chemicals that are also, intentionally or not, released in the marine waters. ";The assessment by Finland of contamination of its marine waters by hazardous substances and acute pollution events is considered adequate. Although very limited information is reported in the reporting sheet, the information provided in the paper report is quantitative or trend-based, concise but focused on the main issues and a judgement is provided which is supported by an HELCOM assessment.;"- Very limited information in the reporting sheet but more information provided in the paper report

Finland;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has defined seven targets and a number of associated indicators to cover D8. Targets 28 and 29 relate to criterion 8.1 of the Commission Decision on concentration of contaminants while targets 30 to 34 relate to criterion 8.2 on effects of contaminants. In addition to the targets, Finland has proposed a number of associated indicators, which further specify the targets and make them measurable.

Most targets/indicators are based on concentration levels; none focus only on controlling specific human activities (except that on the amount of input allowed/permitted). The targets referring to oil spills and oil emissions (target 28 and target 33) and the target on the amount of emission allowed/permitted could be seen as both state- and pressure-targets. 

Target 29 on concentrations of contaminants ensures compliance with the EQS Directive and cover all the substances of the Directive (relevant for Finnish waters), including the priority substances (“concentration of harmful substances do not exceed the environmental quality standards defined by law”). Target 29 is considered SMART as it includes reference to regulatory levels in the text of the target directly.

Target 28 is more specific than Target 29 and also considered SMART. It relates to the concentration of certain synthetic and non-synthetic substances (specified in the indicators) in coastal waters and in fish. It also mentions emissions of oil and chemical compounds. The threshold values reported by Finland in the reporting sheets for the indicators of Target 28 are the EQS Directive and the EU foodstuffs limit regulations. HELCOM standards are mentioned as reference levels only for radioactive substances and number of oil spills. This creates uncertainty for the first four indicators of Target 28, which require measurements of a number of synthetic and non-synthetic substances in biota (fish), since no EQS has been defined in biota for these substances (except for mercury). It is therefore unclear against which reference levels these measurements will be assessed to evaluate achievement of the target. The list of indicators for Target 28 also includes an indicator regarding the number of oil spills observed from surveillance flights. This is not related to criterion 8.1 but covers indicator 8.2.2 of the Commission Decision. No actual values are provided but, in the reporting sheet, Finland has reported “HELCOM” as the threshold value, which is understood to mean that the HELCOM objectives for oil spills should be used.

The targets and indicators on effects of contaminants cover mammals and birds (target 30), fish populations (target 34) and benthic communities (targets 31 and 32). 

Target 30 is supported by four indicators related to a number of biological effects. These indicators are already in use (two of them developed under HELCOM). No actual values are provided as threshold values, Finland has just indicated “HELCOM” and “Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute” for three of them, pointing to the existence of a quantification of these indicators within these two frameworks. The baselines are indicated as “historic” except for the last indicator on the mortality in razorbills, guillemots and arctic terns, for which the baseline is the current status. However for this indicator, no threshold value, reference value/framework or trend is provided meaning that it is not clear when the target is considered to be achieved (i.e. maintenance of current status, X% decrease in mortality, etc.). Target 30 is considered to be SMART.

Apart from the threshold values mentioned in the paragraphs above for Target 28, 29 and 30, no threshold values or baselines have been reported by Finland for the other targets/indicators, many of which are indicated as “operational by 2014/2018”. These targets/indicators therefore lack specification to make them fully SMART.

It should be noted that two indicators are reported in the paper report and not in the reporting sheet. These are imposex-index in molluscs (TBT-exposure) and micronuclei tests in selected animals. It is indicated that these indicators will be operational only by 2014.";The set of targets and indicators defined by Finland to cover D8 is considered partially adequate. Although many indicators (and therefore targets) are not fully SMART because they do not yet have a threshold value/baseline, they are specific and potentially measurable. They cover all elements of the Commission Decision. They also cover acute pollution events and address radionuclides, which is considered a good practice, even though it is not consistent with the GES definition. The targets/indicators on concentrations of contaminants are SMART but there is uncertainty regarding the standards used as reference for substances measured in biota. ;"- Specific and potentially measurable

Finland;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Finland has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor level. In the reporting sheet, Finland reports the same text under criterion 9.1 but it is not considered that criterion 9.1 is fully covered by this definition. Only the part on levels of contaminants is considered to be covered, the part on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded is not included in the scope of the Finnish D9 GES definition. 

The definition refers to EU legislation and other relevant standards. While it is uncertain what is meant with “other relevant standards”, EU legislation is understood to mean the EU foodstuffs limit regulations (Regulation 1881/2006 and amendments). This is confirmed in the reporting sheet since Finland reported as threshold values “limit values of Commission regulation 1881/2006 are not exceeded”.

There is no further information provided regarding the species and substances that are covered by the GES definition. By default, these would be at least all the substances (relevant for Finnish waters), measured in the relevant species, that are included in Regulation 1881/2006.";The definition of GES for D9 by Finland is considered to be partially adequate.

Finland;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"No information is reported in the reporting sheet on the contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances. 

In the paper report, the assessment of contamination of fish for human consumption is done together with the assessment of contamination by hazardous substances (see Section 8 above). While there is no direct reference to Regulation 1881/2006 throughout the report and only one reference to Regulation 1259/2011, Finland provides a limited assessment of concentrations of certain substances in certain species.

First, it assesses that mercury concentrations in fish for human consumption do not exceed limit values. The limit values reported are those of Regulation 1881/2006 (1 mg / kg for the pike, 0.5 mg / kg of other fish). It also makes an assessment of concentrations of dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs and furans in large herring, salmon and sea trout, which it finds as exceeding the limit values in Regulation 1259/2011. However, Finland refers to its exemption from Regulation 1259/2011. Finland is allowed to sell fish, in which certain contaminants (including non-dioxin PCB compounds) are above EU regulatory levels. This exemption however requires regular monitoring of the situation and periodic reporting to the Commission as well as sufficient information to consumers.

In its paper report on Article 9 and 10, Finland reproduces the information regarding exceedance of limit values for herring, salmon and sea trout. It also mentions regional variations. It refers to HELCOM’s conclusion that the status is satisfactory. However, it is not clear whether this concerns species from all Baltic waters or only from Finnish waters. In its letter in response to the completeness check, Finland states that GES has not been reached for D9.

Microbial pathogens

In the reporting sheet, for the Sea of Aaland, the trend in the level of microbial pathogens in bathing waters is assessed as stable and a direct link is provided to the Government website where monitoring results can be viewed. The main causes of pressure are identified as urban (waste water) and shipping. The current status is assessed as good. No assessment is provided for shellfish water, which is justified by Finland by the fact that Finland has no “shellfish waters” and that no other sea food than fish is produced in the Finnish marine waters.

In relation to the Baltic Sea, the trend in the level of microbial pathogens in bathing waters is assessed as stable and Finland notes that in 2010, 98.8% of the coastal bathing areas met the bathing water quality standards. For this sub-division, the main causes of pressure are urban waste waters and livestock production. There is no assessment of the status.";The assessment of the contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption by Finland is considered partially adequate. No information is reported in the reporting sheet, but in the paper report Finland provides some information on contaminations by certain substances of fish for human consumption, in its assessment of general contamination of the marine environment. Finland makes a limited assessment of current status on the basis of Regulation 1259/2011 (but not Regulation 1881/2006) and on the basis of HELCOM conclusions.

Finland;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Finland has defined one target and three associated indicators to cover D9. Two indicators are reported as being already operational while the third one is still to be developed by 2018.

Target 35 requires compliance with EU Regulation 1881/2006 and 1259/2011 on foodstuffs limit values. In addition, target 35 mentions overall decrease in the concentrations of synthetic compounds (but not heavy metals). The addition of this condition means that Target 35 goes further than the GES definition as it requires that concentrations in fish and seafood do not increase (or even remain stable) even if they remain below regulatory levels. However, Finland has not specified a baseline against which such increase/decrease should be measured. 

In the text of its target, Finland also singles out phycotoxins, requiring that their level decreases. Once again, the lack of baseline means that it is uncertain against which level this decrease should be measured. It is also specified that their levels should not exceed international concentration limits in food. It is not clear what this refers to and no threshold values/baselines are specified in the reporting sheet. 

Through the indicators, Finland specifies which substances should be measured (PCBs, dioxins, furans, cadmium, mercury and lead) and in which species. It seems that the indicators for synthetic and non-synthetic substances should only be measured in fish (and no other seafood), while the matrix is not specified for phycotoxins.  The exact fish species that should be used for the samples are not specified either. The question of the origin of the samples is not raised. ";The set of target and indicators defined by Finland to cover D9 is considered partially adequate. Target 35 requires compliance with Regulations 1881/2006 and 1259/2011 and even adds a condition that concentrations should not increase. It also specifically refers to phycotoxins. The indicators defined by Finland for the target specifies which substances should be measured to assess achievement of the target and in which matrix. These indicators restrict the scope of the target in terms of the substances measured and the matrix used and, while this can be considered as a pragmatic approach, it is not certain whether the target will be enough to ensure that GES is achieved, considering that the GES definition is very general. While the target will ensure that GES is achieved for these substances, it does not guarantee that GES is achieved for other substances included in Regulation 1881/2006 (i.e. PAHs) and for other matrices (e.g. cephalopods, bivalve molluscs, crustaceans).;"- Compliance with Regulations 1881/2006 and 1259/2011 required

There is consistency between the initial assessment and the target, although the target refers specifically to phycotoxins, which has not been found in the initial assessment. There is also consistency between the targets and the GES. However, the target is more restricted in its scope, which is a pragmatic approach but not fully consistent with the GES definition. This means that it is uncertain whether the target is sufficient to achieved GES as it is defined now. ";;;;
France (Mediterranean);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has defined the good environmental status for Descriptor 1 at descriptor, criteria and indicator level. In the reporting sheet, GES is defined only at the descriptor and criteria levels in the priority fields; the indicators specified in Annex 2 of the Ministerial Order have been reported in the field “Assessment Method”. 

The GES definition for D1 applies to all French marine subregions. The GES definition is not a simple reformulation of the Annex 1 of the Directive. Due attention has been paid to each criterion and all but two of the associated indicators (1.1.3 and 1.7.1) are included in the GES definition. The definition of GES does not include direct reference to existing European or regional standards. However, the additional text in the Order cross-links the criteria and indicators to relevant EU and international agreements (including the Habitats Directive). 

In the reporting sheets, the GES definition for the various criteria is linked to either “all functional groups” or “all seabed and water column habitats”. This is in line with the objective of the D1 as defined in the Directive, which aims to address all biodiversity elements. In the paper report, France provides the list of predominant habitats and functional groups covered by the French definition for D1. These lists include all of those listed in the classification referenced in EC 2012 . For predominant habitats, France defines two additional “zones” that should be considered, compatible with the Habitats Directive and OSPAR classifications (land and transitional zones). 

In addition to covering all predominant habitats and functional groups, France provides the criteria defined for the selection of habitats and species to be covered by D1. France mentions that selecting a specific list of habitats and species will facilitate the assessment of environmental and anthropogenic pressures and assessment of status as well as facilitate comparison with neighbouring countries. It mentions that the lists should evolve in time in order to select the local or international elements that are the most relevant. 

For the selection of specific species and habitats, France uses the criteria defined by the OSPAR Texel-Faial approach as well as the listed habitats and species as per the Habitats and Birds Directives, the OSPAR and Barcelona Conventions and national SSSI (sites of special scientific interest) (the Bonn Convention and the ASCOBANS and ACCOBAMS agreements are also mentioned in the accompanying document). The criteria also include habitats and species with a particular sensitivity to anthropogenic pressures, habitats with a key functional role and key species from a functional point of view, common species and habitats, rare or declining species or habitats. France mentions that the habitats and species which will be covered by D1 will be specified, on the basis of these criteria, following further studies (as per Article 4 of the Order). The selection is used as a basis to assess all functional groups and predominant habitats. 

The general principles of Favourable Conservation Status (of Habitats Directive) and Good Ecological Status (as in the WFD) are reflected in the definition of GES, although there is no direct reference to either. Only in the accompanying text is the Habitats Directive referred to and the WFD is not mentioned at all. There is a good reference to habitat connectivity in the GES definition and the text does build on indicator 1.7.1, even though it is not further defined. A clear reference is made to “existing natural environmental conditions”, related to natural biological variation as well as climate change, as the baseline for the definition of GES. This is in line with the text of Descriptor 1 in Annex I of the Directive, which mentions “prevailing physiographic, geographic and climate conditions”. The definition of GES therefore recognises that there is natural/climatic variation and ecosystem dynamics, and so does not seek a rigid state for particular biodiversity components. 

The definitions at descriptor and criteria levels are clear that there should not be further deterioration in biodiversity by stating that biodiversity or specific features of biodiversity should be ‘preserved’, should ‘not decrease significantly’ or should be ‘maintained’. Acceptable deviation from reference conditions is partly addressed in that human activities and pressures should be at a level consistent with the ability of the ecosystem to be ecologically resilient. However, the concept of ecological resilience of the ecosystem is vague and it is unclear how it can be measured. There is sufficient understanding that it is ecosystem sustainability which is the aim, not continual increase in biodiversity. 

Threshold values are not directly mentioned. The reliance on “further studies” to determine the levels and the timeframes of the “parameters” associated with each indicators, as per Article 4 of the Ministerial Order, is not entirely clear. Article 4 of the Ministerial Order mentions that the definition of GES shall be updated every six years from the date of its adoption. This seems to indicate that the threshold values and baselines associated to each indicator (parameters) will only be integrated into the definition of GES in 2018 (if they have been defined by then).";"The definition of GES for D1 by France is considered partially adequate. There is an adequate coverage of the criteria and indicators. The GES definition addresses all biodiversity components in the same way and reference is made to the relevant predominant habitats and functional groups addressed by GES. However the descriptions are all purely qualitative (no quantification), and there is no sense of an aim to identify specific standards which need to be enforced. For some of the indicators, relevant EcoQOs could have been used (OSPAR has set leading examples; some of these may also be applicable at least to some sub-regions of this MS). The GES definition is not sufficiently specific to judge when GES has been achieved, unless more specific details are included in the targets (e.g. what is meant with ensuring the integrity of the ecological functions of habitats). ";"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators
- Covers all biodiversity components
- Reference to predominant habitats and functional groups

France (Mediterranean);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
The reporting of species/functional groups for the Mediterranean is similar to that for the Atlantic subregions. The main pressures have been reported for each species/functional group and include introduction of NIS, extraction of species, introduction of hazardous substances, marine litter and physical loss and damage. As for the Atlantic subregions, France never makes an assessment of status for the whole species/functional group but provides several assessments of the status of certain species listed in the EU, regional and international agreements. In addition to those listed for the Atlantic subregions, France refers to the list of protected fish species drawn up by UNEP/MAP. 

Habitat types
The reporting of habitat types in the Mediterranean is very similar to that for the Atlantic subregions. The main pressures on each habitat type have been identified and include physical loss, marine litter, introduction of NIS, physical disturbance, loss and damage, extraction of species and introduction of hazardous substance. As for the Atlantic subregions, the status of the habitat’s distribution, extent and condition are not assessed. France provides the same justification as regard the lack of data as for the Atlantic subregions but no future plans. In several instances, France provides a partial assessment of the status of habitat types. In a few cases, France refers to EU standards to make this judgement (e.g. reference to the assessment undertaken for Article 17 of the Habitats Directive for shallow sublittoral mixed sediment and shelf sublittoral rock and biogenic reef or reference to the WFD for shelf waters) although the predominant habitats selected for the purpose of this initial assessment do not correspond to those under the Habitats Directive or the WFD. In other cases (e.g. shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef), France just provides a conclusive statement that status is good or bad in certain areas of the subregions but it is not clear how it reaches this conclusion and it acknowledges that it has not carried out a region-wide assessment.  There is no reference to UNEP/MAP. 

Ecosystems
France has not assessed ecosystems. ";Overall the assessment of biological features by France for the Mediterranean marine region is considered partially adequate. For habitats, France has not reported on all relevant habitat types. France describes the habitat types reported in quite some details and provides, for some of them, a qualitative judgement on their status in reference to assessments carried out under other processes such as the Habitats Directive and the WFD. For species/functional groups, France describes the groups reported in quite some details but does not make a judgement on the overall status of the species/functional groups. As for the Atlantic subregions, it does provide a judgement on the status of specific species recognized as endangered or threatened according to various EU, RSC and international agreements. However, these ad hoc judgements should be consolidated into a more concise judgement of status. France frequently refers to the in-depth analysis made in its initial assessment paper reports. The consistency check shows that similar type of information is reported in the paper report as in the reporting sheets (but more detailed) and no judgement is made on the status of the species/functional groups. The justification provided by France (limited and fragmented data) should have been complemented by details regarding future plans. Only a general sentence on the review of the assessment of the next reporting cycle is provided by France. ;"Features:
- Covers main species/functional groups but not all relevant habitat types
- No conclusive judgement on status of habitats/ species/ functional groups, only for endangered or threatened species
- Reference to the Habitats Directive and the relevant international agreements";2;Partially adequate
France (Mediterranean);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The targets defined for the Mediterranean region are organised by biodiversity component and address tangible impacts/pressures and activities. They cover all three biodiversity descriptors together. Indicators are associated to the targets, some of which are quite specific and could be considered operational. However, no baselines, reference points, threshold values or trend goals are defined for the targets and indicators, which makes it impossible to measure progress towards the achievement of the target. 

Specific targets and associated indicators are provided for birds, mammals and fish. No target is designed for reptiles. Other targets to be developed in view of the next reporting cycle are reported under this exercise as “to be developed”, suggesting that targets for reptiles will not be considered. For most of the “Habitat” targets, it is not specified which habitats the targets will address. The “Fish” targets are actually more relevant for descriptor 3 than for the biodiversity descriptors.

Only one associated indicator makes a direct reference to European standards (Target E.3. indicator “Surface area of the species habitats in a good state of conservation in relation to noise and light pollution (Natura 2000 indicator)”). Other targets related to conservation and habitat and species protection do not refer to any existing international, European or RSC instruments. It is not clear for instance how the “Mammals” targets relate to or complement the ACCOBANS agreement. Targets also refer to marine protected areas, and ‘areas benefitting from a protective or management regime’ but they do not specify where they are located or cross reference them with existing MPAs, MNRs, SACs, SPAs etc. However, the Mediterranean targets refer frequently to existing national instruments or projects (PAMM, SCOT, MEDAM). This suggests a more operational and practical approach to the design of the targets for the Mediterranean, inscribed in existing national frameworks, than for the other subregions. 

Despite the relative specificity of the Mediterranean targets and indicators, certain details are missing to make them truly operational and geared towards achieving GES. Several targets refer to biodiversity elements without giving enough details to determine exactly which elements or which locations are concerned by the target (e.g. marine wildlife, canyons, areas of coral and seagrass, some terrestrial species, etc.) This also applies to several pressure targets which lack specificity as to which pressures/impacts or activities (e.g. reduce the risk of smothering habitats by anthropogenic activities, limit other human disturbances). Several targets refer to areas protected by legislation/management regime or regulated without providing details regarding which regime/legislation is concerned. ";The set of targets and indicators defined by France to cover the biodiversity descriptors in the Mediterranean region is considered partially adequate. The targets defined for the Mediterranean region are much more specific and pressure-oriented than those defined for the Atlantic subregions. However, certain key elements are still missing, which prevents them from being SMART. In particular, the lack of threshold values and baselines means that, however specific the targets and associated indicators are, they cannot be considered achievable. ;"- Targets cover all three biodiversity descriptors
- Specific and pressure-oriented targets and associated indicators
- Potentially measurable but lack of threshold values and baseline";2;Partially adequate
France (Mediterranean);D1;Consistency ;;"Considering that the GES definitions for D1, 4 and 6 are general and address all features, the features assessed in the initial assessment are consistent with the GES definitions for biodiversity. The assessment of pressures, physical loss and damage, is also consistent with the GES definition for D1 and D6. Although there is a lack of consistency in the reporting sheets between what is reported under the physical loss/damage pressures and the inclusion of these pressures as impacting certain habitat types. However, the pressures addressed under the D1 definition are much broader than just physical loss and damage (e.g. fisheries, eutrophication, contaminants, NIS, etc.) These are also covered by the French initial assessment and are assessed in the following sections of the present report. 

With regard to the targets for the Atlantic subregions, these are so general that it can be considered that they cover all the features included in the initial assessment but the link between the conclusions from the initial assessment (e.g. on the bad status of a particular element when it has been assessed) and the targets is not made. For the Mediterranean region, the specificity of the targets indicates a closer link between the IA and the targets defined. Although it is not in the scope of this assessment to verify that each target defined for the Mediterranean finds grounds in the full IA for the Mediterranean (paper report), the consistency check carried out indicates that this is the case. 

There is also a lack of consistency between the extensive but too general GES definitions and the limited and still too general targets. In particular the targets defined for the Atlantic subregions clearly do not cover all aspects of the GES definitions. On the other hand, considering that the GES definitions for all three descriptors are without GES boundaries and baselines, it could have been expected that the targets defined include these elements, in order to introduce some form of specificity. ";;;;
France (Mediterranean);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in both the reporting sheet and the Ministerial Order. All criteria and indicator laid out for Descriptor 10 in the Commission Decision are incorporated. 

France has developed the GES concept further for marine litter, especially at descriptor level. The GES definition aims at zero-impact of marine litter on a number of aspects of which the most important are the impact on marine life at the population level and as driver for the introduction of invasive species. In addition, marine litter should have no adverse consequences for human health and have no adverse economic consequences for maritime activities, industries, coastal communities and navigation. The zero-impact of marine litter can be achieved when waste and their degradation products existing in and entering the sub-marine region are significantly reduced over time. France is not only targeting existing waste in the marine environment, but also targets new waste entering the marine environment. A baseline and threshold values have not yet been set. 

For the North-East Atlantic region, France is referring and using data from the relevant OSPAR initiatives and monitoring programmes with respect to marine litter, i.e. the monitoring programmes on beach litter, the Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) on plastic particles in Fulmars’ (Fulmarus glacialis) stomachs and seabed trawling. With the respect to the Mediterranean, reference is not made to UNEP/MAP MED POL. On the other hand, UNEP/MAP MED POL has only recently started to develop a common approach for marine litter. In absence of the Fulmar, the indicators for the impact on marine life still have to be defined. ";Even though a quantification of the GES definition is still needed, it is considered that the current GES definition, given the available knowledge, is adequate. France has defined GES for D10 for all criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision and has even gone one step further. In addition, it is referring to the relevant regional standards. ;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators
- Use of relevant RSC standards
- Lack of quantification (but in line with state of knowledge)";3;Adequate
France (Mediterranean);D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);" For beach litter, France reports the volume of waste collected per day at the beach and the different types of waste collected. In addition, data is reported on floating waste, floating micro-particles and seabed marine litter, including the zones of accumulation. The impact of water on marine organisms is reported for sea-turtles and marine mammals. Statistics on birds have not been provided. The Fulmar is not present in the Mediterranean. Without presenting substantive evidence, a significant impact of marine litter on fytobenthos is expected. Geographical differentiation is given for beach litter, floating litter, micro-plastics and seabed litter. For the impact on marine litter, statistics for the region are given. Data and knowledge gaps are reported on the impact of marine litter on habitats, for both seabed and water column habitat. 

Reference to the Regional Sea Convention is not made. Even though there are limited official data on marine litter and UNEP MAP MED/POL also has difficulties in comparing data from different countries, due to lack of standards, France reports a substantial amount of data and has demonstrated good practice for several aspects, including for the monitoring of seabed litter, floating litter and micro-particles. ";The initial assessment made by France of pollution by marine litter is considered adequate for the Mediterranean marine region for the same reasons as those outlined for the Atlantic region above. With regard to reference to relevant RSC standards, the lack of reference to UNEP MAP is justified considering the limited information available from the RSC on this topic.;"- Substantial knowledge base reported (level of and impacts from pressure)
- No reference to RSC approach but expected considering lack of such policy
- No judgement but expected in light of current knowledge";3;Adequate
France (Mediterranean);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"A consistent set of environmental targets is reported by France aiming to reduce the inflows of waste, especially beach and coastal litter in coastal cities (G1, G2) and one the waste recovery of litter by fishing vessels (G3). While target G1 aims to reduce the discharge and deposition of waste by coastal cities, targets G2 and G3 focus on more effective waste management, including collection and waste disposal on land and at sea. Target G4 aims to fill a knowledge gap on micro-particles.

Targets G1-G3 address important pressures that are preventing to achieve GES. In addition, the targets are measurable by means of well-defined associated indicators. Baseline and threshold values still need to be set.  Even though the focus of targets and associated indicators is appreciated, it is unclear whether all pressures and impacts are covered.  A target on a reduced impact of litter on marine life and/or habitats is missing, despite the importance as part of the GES definition. Yet, it may be expected that the current set of targets will also reduce the impact on marine life and habitat, the latter is not clear from the French report. Likewise, it is unclear why other important sources of marine litter, beyond the coastal cities and fishing gear are not covered. 

Target G4 addresses the knowledge gap on micro-particles. Though easily measurable, the associated indicator is moderately ambitious and the indicator could be more outcome-oriented. Even though the knowledge gap of micro-particles is addressed, it is not clear how other knowledge gaps will be addressed, e.g. on the impact of waste on marine life and habitats.";The set of targets and associated indicators for the Mediterranean is considered as partially adequate as it is much more specific than that for the North East Atlantic and the indicators are measurable but there is still a lack of baselines and quantitative threshold values.;"- More specific targets and indicators than for NEA
- Measurable indicators but lack of threshold values and baselines";2;Partially adequate
France (Mediterranean);D10;Consistency ;;"The GES definition is much wider than the Initial Assessment allowed for, despite the substantial data availability. France is considered ambitious and reports an all-inclusive GES definition. Data is mostly available for beach litter, seabed litter and the impact on marine life in both the North-East Atlantic region and the Mediterranean. Zones of accumulation for floating litter and on the seabed have been reported in both marine regions. The envisaged reduced impact on socio-economic sectors and communities, human health and invasive species, as mentioned in the GES definition, has only been covered indirectly by the Initial Assessment and the set of targets. 

For the Channel North Sea, through involvement in OSPAR, the Fulmar programme has led to the existence of knowledge and data on the impact of ingested marine litter on Fulmars. For the Mediterranean, Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay, in absence of the Fulmars, other indicators have to be developed. The reported data from sea turtles and sea mammals in the initial assessment gives an indication of potential indicator organisms. For the Celtic Seas, data availability is limited. While ample reference is given to OSPAR, the Mediterranean regional sea convention is not mentioned.

In both regions, the set of targets addresses important sources of marine litter and has moved beyond the state indicators as described in the Commission Decision. France has defined promising tools that can assist in achieving GES. Yet, a baseline and threshold values still have be set for GES and targets. While the GES definition is equal and reporting for the initial assessment is similar, the main difference between the reporting of both regions is the level of detail of the targets. On the one hand, targets for the North-East Atlantic Ocean are insufficiently precise, not measurable and lack associated indicators. On the other hand, the targets for the Mediterranean are well-focused and measurable, through well-defined associated indicators. The set of targets and associated indicators is not sufficient to achieve GES, considering the lack of quantification, but France is on its way to make them sufficient.";;;;
France (Mediterranean);D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor level, criteria and indicator levels. Both criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 11 in the Commission Decision are incorporated. At descriptor level, France has developed the GES concept for underwater noise further. GES is achieved when the abundance, mortality risk, detection and communication behaviour of sensitive species is not affected by underwater noise. France has identified Cetaceans and Pinnipeds as species sensitive to disturbance by underwater noise. The ‘functional ecological zones’ will be used as scale of evaluation.

The indicators are precisely cited from the Commission Decision. In addition, for indicator 11.2.1 (continuous low frequency sound), France also includes important sources of underwater noise, namely coastal and deep-sea shipping, nautical activities using noise emitters, e.g. for oil and gas exploration, and sea construction works. Reference to the Regional Sea Conventions is not reported. The baseline, trends and threshold values will be further developed, with an overall deadline of 2018 set globally for the review of the French marine strategy. ";The GES definition for D11 by France is considered adequate, although it is unrealistic to consider that France will be able to assess that it has achieved GES by 2020 under the current provisions, taking into account the limited data availability for underwater noise.;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators
- Use of relevant approaches
- Lack of quantification (but in line with current state of knowledge)";3;Adequate
France (Mediterranean);D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);For the Mediterranean, major sources of underwater noise are reported to be offshore exploration and production (E&P), shipping and port activities. Even though, France reports that E&P activities are increasing, the levels of impulsive sound are regarded as low except in the vicinity of ports. The impact of E&P activities on underwater sound production needs to be further developed. The level of continuous noise (shipping) is stable but relatively high and homogeneously spread. Similarly as in the North East Atlantic Ocean, a spatial assessment has not be been done. Baseline and thresholds value still have to be set.;Given the current state of knowledge, the initial assessment on underwater noise for the Mediterranean subregion is considered adequate. France provides an adequate level of information on the sources of noise, including past and current trends.;"- Relevant information reported considering current state of knowledge
- No spatial assessment and no judgement in relation to GES (but expected in light of current knowledge)";3;Adequate
France (Mediterranean);D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"For the Mediterranean, France reports two targets one subtarget for each target.

The targets are general ‘nature conservation’ targets, not specifically geared towards the reduction of underwater noise and not measurable as such. The subtargets defined however are more specific and could be considered measurable. In addition, there is a reference in the target to existing EU indicators. However, there is a lack of information on the threshold values and baselines to be used to assess progress. In summary, targets are considered partially adequate. ";The set of targets and indicators covering D10 for the Mediterranean region are considered partially adequate. The targets for the Mediterranean appear more specific and measurable than those defined for the Atlantic regions but they will be very difficult to measure in some cases.;"- More specific targets and indicators than for NEA
- Measurable indicators but lack of threshold values and baselines";2;Partially adequate
France (Mediterranean);D11;Consistency ;;The GES definition and the assessment of pressures and impact are considered consistent. The state of underwater noise is linked to the activities that are the main source of underwater sound. In general, most information is reported for the Channel North Sea and the Celtic Seas. Less is reported for the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean. The environmental targets can be considered as a further specification of the GES definition and needs to be further specified. It is furthermore unclear why different targets are proposed for the North East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean.;;;;
France (Mediterranean);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 2 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in both the paper report (Ministerial Order) and the reporting sheet. The definition at descriptor level reproduces verbatim the definition of Annex I of the MSFD. At the criteria level, the French definition is more specific. At indicator level, the definitions reproduce literally the wording of the Commission Decision, but are set only for indicators 2.1.1 and 2.2.2. Indicator 2.2.1 on the ratio between invasive NIS and native species in relation to change in species composition is not included. 

The French report further indicates that parameters associated to the indicator, as well as the levels and trends corresponding to GES will be defined for both criteria following complementary research in time for the update of GES definition by 2018. The Ministerial Order (Annex 2) specifies that the relevant assessment unit for criteria 2.1 is individual species, simply stating that these are those species which presence has been identified in marine sub-regions. For criterion 2.2, the relevant assessment unit will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the particular NIS and its known or potential impacts. The list of species is to be drawn on the basis of complementary studies. ";The GES definition for D2 is considered as inadequate. At descriptor and indicator level, the French definition merely reproduces the definition set by the Directive and the Commission Decision. There is no baseline. GES is defined in very general terms. The frequency and intensity of new introductions of NIS through human activities should be reduced to a minimum, which is considered as a minimum requirement (which means that NIS can still be introduced), without defining thresholds or reference conditions and baselines.;"- Inadequate coverage of Decision indicators (no justification)
- No baseline, no threshold value (what is considered a minimum)
- No specifics on types of NIS, vectors and paths of spreading";1;Inadequate
France (Mediterranean);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"A list of 155 NIS is provided, indicating for all of them whether or not there are invasive species, and for some, the country/area of origin and date first recorded. It should be noted that the French RS also indicates that for the whole sub-region. The report notes that the Mediterranean region is particularly impacted by NIS. The main pathways are shipping, aquaculture, recreational shipping, fishing bait, aquarium trade, and the Suez Canal. However, no ranking is provided as the relative significance of each of these vectors depends on the group of species concerned.

An assessment of the level of pressure on the environment is carried out and the level of pressure is considered as increasing with no assessment of future trends. The information is generally limited. Impacted features are not all identified. There are no water column features reported but only seabed and functional groups. The level of impact is only judged for a limited number of features. The proportion of impacted features is not assessed. There is no trend reported on the level of impact and no global assessment or judgement has been done at the level of the sub-region. France states that due consideration will be given to these knowledge gaps in the framework of the revisions of the different elements for the next cycle, that is 2018, there is no further indication in terms of concrete actions and responsibilities.";The intial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered to be partially adequate for the Mediterranean region, in view of what can be expected for Descriptor 2. France has provided a list of NIS and information on the level of pressure. The main pathways are identified and described.  However, there is no judgement of the status in relation to GES and the assessment of impacts is limited.;"- List of NIS provided

France (Mediterranean);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The targets are considered as not considered as SMART because while they can be considered as specific (reduce particular risk) and time-bound (December 2020), they are not measurable, achievable and realistic. Combined with the vague definitions of GES, there is no quantification, thresholds, reference conditions and baseline. No specification is given as to how to reduce the risk and to which levels.

Regarding the spread of NIS, not all main sources of introductions are covered. Only ballast water, aquaculture and import of fauna and flora are mentioned when other vectors such as fouling, recreational shipping, fishing bait and the Suez Canal are not when they were included in the initial assessment. ";Similarly to the other three sub-regions, the environmental targets set for the Western Mediterranean are considered as inadequate to achieve GES, which is itself defined in a rather vague way. They are more detailed than in the other sub-regions, declining one general target into particular targets, themselves linked to indicators. However, these remain vague, without any threshold values, reference point or baseline.;"- More detailed than for NEA and related to identified pressures/impacts

France (Mediterranean);D2;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressure and its impact from NIS is consistent with the French definition of GES. However, while the assessment has identified particular species and vectors/pathways, the definition of GES and environmental targets and associated indicators remain very general.

France (Mediterranean);D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 3 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in both the paper report (Ministerial Order) and the RS. The Descriptor definition for France is the same as that provided in the Commission Decision, for Descriptor 3. In the case of Descriptor 3 this is an acceptable practice. All Descriptor 3 criteria as laid out in the Commission Decision are incorporated and specific indicators have been identified for each. Only indicators 3.3.2 and 3.3.4 seem to be missing. Criterion 3.3 has been copied directly from the Commission Decision without any modifications while criterion 3.1 and 3.2 are specified further. 

In the Ministerial Order, France makes clear reference to relevant EU legislation. References to the work of ICES are made in the accompanying document. Details of the stocks covered by the GES definition for each marine subregion are included in the Ministerial Order but there is a lack of multispecies assessment in general.  

Criterion 3.1
The French GES definition for indicator 3.1.1 “Fishing mortality” does not follow the guidelines from the Commission Decision that Fmsy should be set as a limit rather than a target. The use of Fpa as a lower limit is also not considered as an acceptable limit for F.  In those cases where there is no analytical assessment yielding values for F, France uses the secondary indicator provided by the Commission Decision (i.e. the catch/biomass ratio). The GES definition for France requires that this indicator remains stable or shows a decreasing trend. This is in line with the current approach, as outlined by the Commission Decision and the 2010 Task Group 3 Report.  However, it should be noted that the Task Group 3 Report states that the secondary indicators that are based on the absence of a degradation gradient are the best possible criterion for GES but fail in achieving true GES when the attribute described has already deteriorated to a more or less stable (degraded) state. 

Criterion 3.2
France has set GES at or above MSY-Btrigger for their SSB with a probability of 50%. Setting the SSB at MSY-Btrigger is in line with current Commission guidance. However the GES definition should be set as a limit rather than a target, therefore the statement regarding a 50% probability is not in accordance with current Commission guidance. In the case where analytical assessments yielding values for SSB are not available France uses the secondary indicator (3.2.2) “biomass indices” and requires that for each stock the indicator remains stable or shows a positive trend. This is in line with current Commission guidance. 

Criterion 3.3
France has repeated textually the text as provided in the Commission Decision and has not specified it further. Indicators 3.3.1 and 3.3.3 have been developed further but do not contain any specific thresholds. Criterion 3.3 requires further development both by France and within the MSFD process in general. France acknowledges the gaps in knowledge in relation to criterion 3.3 and the necessity to keep developing this particular aspect of GES. This is in line with current Commission guidance.";The French GES definition for Descriptor 3 is considered inadequate. For Criterion 3.1 setting Fishing mortality at Fmsy is in line with the Commission Decision but this needs to be set as a limit rather than a target. The application of the secondary indicator catch/biomass ratio follows current Commission guidance. For Criterion 3.2 the use of MSY-Btrigger is in line with the Commission Decision but this will need to be set as a limit rather than a target. The use of the secondary indicator biomass indices has been adequately applied. In the case of Criterion 3.3 it is acknowledged by the Commission that this criterion requires additional work to become operational and therefore the current French application of this criterion is considered adequate.;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators (including secondary indicators) and adequate use of EU standards (Fmsy and MSY-Btrigger)

France (Mediterranean);D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The assessment of the level of and impacts from the pressure caused by the extraction of fish and shellfish (fisheries) has been done at a similar level of detail and using a similar methodology for all four marine subregions. The assessment of adequacy has therefore been done for the four subregions together.

The French assessment of the level of fisheries pressure for both commercial and recreational fishing has been reported in detail (including quantitative information) for all subregions. Reductions in commercial fleet sizes are given as percentage reductions in fleet sizes from those in the late nineties compared to the current fleet sizes for each region except for the Celtic Sea. In addition, France has provided a partial judgement on the level of the pressure from fisheries, which has been done by reference to Fmsy (and therefore to GES) using ICES estimates. However, it has not concluded on the state of the stocks with respect to GES.

The assessment of impacts provides a general overview of the various impacts by fisheries but lacks quantitative assessments and references to historic baselines. In particular France states that the impact of trawling has not been quantified across the four subregions. In all four subregions, impacts of fisheries on the seabed, fish, marine mammals and turtles have been estimated as moderate although not in relation to GES. 

France has also provided a partial judgement on the impacts of fisheries on fish and shellfish by providing information on the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of relevant stocks for the marine subregions (providing the list of these stocks), referring to ICES estimates. Again, France has not concluded on whether the level of impacts on fish and shellfish is at or below GES. ";The French initial assessment for descriptor 3 is considered adequate.  The French assessment has assessed fishing fleets and the level of fishing pressure including that of recreational fisheries. Relevant stocks have been assessed in relation to relevant MSY and PA reference points. Furthermore the impacts of fisheries on the functional groups.

- Lack of judgement in relation to GES
- Lack of plans to address knowledge gaps";3;Adequate
France (Mediterranean);D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"France has defined three targets and associated indicators dealing with commercial fish and shellfish in the Mediterranean. Targets C., C.1, and C.2 are general and it is not clear how these will contribute to reducing fishing effort towards Fmsy or restoring the SSB of overfished stocks. Instead the targets state that the intention is to maintain the living resources or fish populations. 

The initial assessment however states that several stocks have a fishing mortality exceeding Fmsy and none of the assessed stocks have a SSBY higher than MSY. Furthermore the ICES MSFD D3 REPORT 2012 assessment of the Mediterranean recommends that the fishing mortality for various stocks needs to be reduced. The targets as specified by France therefore do not address the issues raised by the initial assessment or ICES.";The set of targets and indicators for the Mediterranean is considered inadequate. The targets are vague and lack measurable objectives/thresholds.

France (Mediterranean);D3;Consistency ;;"The GES definition for D3 for France still requires some modifications to be in line with the decisions made regarding Descriptor 3 in the context of the MSFD CIS process. However, the GES definition does apply the primary and secondary indicators as provided in the Commission Decision with the exception of indicator 3.3.2. The GES definition is the same for all of the French subregions and therefore consistent across regions. 

With regard to the initial assessment, France does refer to fishing mortality and SSBs for several stocks but does not assess the level of the extraction pressure in relation to the GES definition. The initial assessment has been done in a consistent manner for each marine subregion. The targets as provided by France remain vague and unspecific and do not address the issues identified in the initial assessment. They also do not use the GES indicators and thresholds. The targets for the Atlantic and the Mediterranean are different but suffer from similar issues.

France (Mediterranean);D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"As for D1, GES is defined at descriptor, criteria and indicator level. There is a good coverage of all criteria and indicators as defined in the Commission Decision but none of the supplementary indicators defined in the Decision are used. France justifies this because the development of these indicators can only be ongoing because it will require further research to understand exactly how food webs respond to each of the pressures and what are the emergent properties resulting from the impact of these pressures. The definition of GES at descriptor level is not a simple reformulation of Annex 1 of the Directive and there is an expanded definition of each of the Commission Decision criteria. 
 
The accompanying document cites the Habitats and Birds Directives, OSPAR’s EcoQOs (but these are not explicitly included in the GES definitions), the Barcelona Convention, ACCOBAMS and ASCOBANS. In terms of the biological elements covered by the definition of D4, France mentions the three biological groups that are covered by D4: plankton (bacterioplankton, phytoplankton and zooplankton), mobile species (small pelagic and demersal fish, cephalopods, top predators and elasmobranchs) and benthos (zoobenthos and phytobenthos). In addition, as for D1, France provides a detailed account in its accompanying document of the criteria that will be used for the selection of the species to be considered (including top predators). In the Ministerial Order, no detail is provided on the species covered by the definition other than those “sampled in scientific missions”. Links to other relevant descriptors are made in the accompanying document. 
 
The text of the definition of D4 is qualitative. Relevant thresholds are to be specified at a later date (as for D1). More information is provided on the Large Fish Indicator (4.2.1), referring to OSPAR’s EcoQO, but France specifies that for the moment this indicator is relevant only for demersal fish and thresholds are set only for the North Sea subregion. It should be noted that France has included a condition related to recycling processes of organic matter for the achievement of GES. This is line with the special focus given by France to contamination by microbial pathogens and should be noted as a good practice as this aspect is neglected in most monitoring and assessment programmes. It is equally relevant to D1.7 as to D4.  ";Taking into account that D4 requires unfamiliar assessment approaches, the GES definition for D4 by France is considered to be adequate. There is an adequate coverage of all criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision. There is no direct reference to RSC approaches in the definitions themselves but in the accompanying text. There is in general a lack of quantification of the definitions. Finally, it is understood that indicators for D4 are underdeveloped, but it should be possible to pinpoint some of the key predator-prey relationships within the region/sub-region. There is no clear plan as to how and when additional research would be carried out to further develop these indicators. However, the inclusion of an indicator on the recycling processes of organic matter is considered a good practice. ;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators

France (Mediterranean);D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

The targets defined for the Mediterranean region are organised by biodiversity component and address tangible impacts/pressures and activities. They cover all three biodiversity descriptors together. Indicators are associated to the targets, some of which are quite specific and could be considered operational. However, no baselines, reference points, threshold values or trend goals are defined for the targets and indicators, which makes it impossible to measure progress towards the achievement of the target. 

Specific targets and associated indicators are provided for birds, mammals and fish. No target is designed for reptiles. Other targets to be developed in view of the next reporting cycle are reported under this exercise as “to be developed”, suggesting that targets for reptiles will not be considered. For most of the “Habitat” targets, it is not specified which habitats the targets will address. The “Fish” targets are actually more relevant for descriptor 3 than for the biodiversity descriptors.

Only one associated indicator makes a direct reference to European standards (Target E.3. indicator “Surface area of the species habitats in a good state of conservation in relation to noise and light pollution (Natura 2000 indicator)”). Other targets related to conservation and habitat and species protection do not refer to any existing international, European or RSC instruments. It is not clear for instance how the “Mammals” targets relate to or complement the ACCOBANS agreement. Targets also refer to marine protected areas, and ‘areas benefitting from a protective or management regime’ but they do not specify where they are located or cross reference them with existing MPAs, MNRs, SACs, SPAs etc. However, the Mediterranean targets refer frequently to existing national instruments or projects (PAMM, SCOT, MEDAM). This suggests a more operational and practical approach to the design of the targets for the Mediterranean, inscribed in existing national frameworks, than for the other subregions. 

Despite the relative specificity of the Mediterranean targets and indicators, certain details are missing to make them truly operational and geared towards achieving GES. Several targets refer to biodiversity elements without giving enough details to determine exactly which elements or which locations are concerned by the target (e.g. marine wildlife, canyons, areas of coral and seagrass, some terrestrial species, etc.) This also applies to several pressure targets which lack specificity as to which pressures/impacts or activities (e.g. reduce the risk of smothering habitats by anthropogenic activities, limit other human disturbances). Several targets refer to areas protected by legislation/management regime or regulated without providing details regarding which regime/legislation is concerned. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of targets and indicators defined by France to cover the biodiversity descriptors in the Mediterranean region is considered partially adequate. The targets defined for the Mediterranean region are much more specific and pressure-oriented than those defined for the Atlantic subregions. However, certain key elements are still missing, which prevents them from being SMART. In particular, the lack of threshold values and baselines means that, however specific the targets and associated indicators are, they cannot be considered achievable. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

France (Mediterranean);D4;Consistency ;;"Considering that the GES definitions for D1, 4 and 6 are general and address all features, the features assessed in the initial assessment are consistent with the GES definitions for biodiversity. The assessment of pressures, physical loss and damage, is also consistent with the GES definition for D1 and D6. Although there is a lack of consistency in the reporting sheets between what is reported under the physical loss/damage pressures and the inclusion of these pressures as impacting certain habitat types. However, the pressures addressed under the D1 definition are much broader than just physical loss and damage (e.g. fisheries, eutrophication, contaminants, NIS, etc.) These are also covered by the French initial assessment and are assessed in the following sections of the present report. 

With regard to the targets for the Atlantic subregions, these are so general that it can be considered that they cover all the features included in the initial assessment but the link between the conclusions from the initial assessment (e.g. on the bad status of a particular element when it has been assessed) and the targets is not made. For the Mediterranean region, the specificity of the targets indicates a closer link between the IA and the targets defined. Although it is not in the scope of this assessment to verify that each target defined for the Mediterranean finds grounds in the full IA for the Mediterranean (paper report), the consistency check carried out indicates that this is the case. 

There is also a lack of consistency between the extensive but too general GES definitions and the limited and still too general targets. In particular the targets defined for the Atlantic subregions clearly do not cover all aspects of the GES definitions. On the other hand, considering that the GES definitions for all three descriptors are without GES boundaries and baselines, it could have been expected that the targets defined include these elements, in order to introduce some form of specificity. ";;;;
France (Mediterranean);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in both the paper report (Ministerial Order) and the RS. 

All Descriptor 5 criteria laid out in the Commission Decision are incorporated and specific indicators identified. GES (MSFD) is at least comparable to GES (WFD) normative definitions of ecological status for coastal waters. The indicators selected appear to offer full compliance with Descriptor 5 and its associated criteria and indicators. The GES definition is matched to the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal marine waters and thus GES (MSFD) should equate to at least GES (WFD). Furthermore, the accompanying text to the Ministerial Report states that “GES... is based on the use of the WFD methodology... [with]... an extension of this approach seaward”, and provides some details on how the WFD methodology will be adapted to the offshore areas.

However, while references are provided in the Ministerial Order to access details about threshold values and EQR baselines, the information is not included in the GES definition directly. In the accompanying document, it is indicated that the threshold values associated to the indicators are those of the WFD for coastal waters and that for offshore waters, they still need to be defined. It appears that while OSPAR-derived thresholds are not yet used in offshore areas (although they might be in the future), OSPAR’s Common Procedure, meetings of HASEC and the ICG draft advice document on GES D5 seem to provide the basis for the French approach to MSFD eutrophication assessment and management. The approach offers flexibility in its application, depending on data availability and reference conditions. 

In terms of adequacy, the definition of GES is a reformulation of the MSFD, but with one important exception: GES can be achieved if nutrient levels are high, providing direct or indirect impacts are limited. The terms ‘high level’ and ‘limited impacts’ are not clearly defined, although they are directly linked to the definitions at indicator levels (indicator 1 for the nutrient levels and 2 and 3 for the impacts). As mentioned before, there are no clear threshold values for some of these indicators and their establishment is linked to future studies with no specific responsibilities assigned or timeline (except the overall timeline of 2018 for the review of the marine strategy). ";The GES definition for Descriptor 5 by France is considered partially adequate. France went to a lot of details for its definition of GES and seems to be in line with the minimum requirements, although the lack of specification regarding the threshold values to be used in offshore areas is an important gap. It is difficult to fully assess the adequacy of the GES definition, so long as it not clear which approach (WFD, OSPAR or a mix) will be chosen by France for the definition of threshold values. Adopting WFD thresholds and applying them to offshore waters may result in a less ambitious interpretation of the MSFD than that envisaged by OSPAR. In addition, France has left an open door which could prevent reaching GES. ;"- Detailed definition of GES and in line with minimum requirements 
- Lack of specification on approach to be used to set threshold values in offshore areas (WFD/OSPAR)
- Open door (GES can be reached with nutrients at high level)";2;Partially adequate
France (Mediterranean);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Limited, qualitative, information is reported on the level of nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations in the environment. No information is reported for the level of concentrations of organic matter generated by phytoplankton productivity within the sea (probably considered not to be relevant). While total N and total P would be the preferred nutrient species (parameters) for load estimation, this information is not present for all sources (pressures). It is not clear whether organic loads from rivers have been determined or whether organic loads include those from coastal discharges, and organic loads are determined based on BOD measurements. The potential oxygen-consuming capacity of pressures would be doubled (approximately) if based on COD measurements. 

Information on marine activities causing the pressure is sparse, qualitative and based on 2004 inventory prepared for the WFD. Major sources of nutrients are covered, but a number of alternative sources, which may provide a substantial contribution to localised eutrophication impacts, such as aquaculture are not included. It is not known whether maritime transport emissions are included in the modelled nitrogen deposition rates.

A more detailed assessment is done for the impacts on water column and seabed habitats, which includes all relevant coastal water bodies. The situation with regard to further offshore waters is unclear. Water transparency is not included in the assessment but other parameters (chlorophyll a, oxygen and phytoplankton blooms) are included. 

Conclusive judgements have not been made on the level of and impacts from eutrophication, nor on trends. The RS contains only a descriptive part on the status of pressure/impacts without making a conclusive judgement on how the status relates to GES and its trends. However, France makes a positive assessment of the level of the impacts of nutrient enrichment on the water column in six areas in relation to the Good Ecological Status of the WFD. ";The analysis and assessment by France of the level of, and impact from, eutrophication is considered as partially adequate in the light of available knowledge/ level of information/ established methods. While France recognises gaps in knowledge, there is no clear future plan to address those. In addition, there is no link between the assessment data and GES. ;"- Sufficient information reported on levels of pressure and input loads but lack of quantification

France (Mediterranean);D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"None of the targets reported by France for the Mediterranean region are directly related to D5 and therefore no assessment of adequacy has been done. This might be because the IA has not identified eutrophication as a problem for the Mediterranean but targets could be defined to ensure that GES is maintained by 2020. France does not provide any justification for the lack of targets related to Descriptor 5.

In order to be as comprehensive as possible, it could be said that targets F3, F4 and F5 defined for D8 will also contribute to the achievement of GES:
F3. Improve reliability of waste water systems of coastal towns and municipalities
Associated indicators: Indicator of reliability of sanitation systems (collection rate, transfer rate, depollution rate)
Associated indicators: Compliance rate of sanitation systems
F4. Eliminate direct discharges, or offshore discharges, from areas of ship repair and maintenance by establishing a treatment, including appropriate connection to the sanitation network
Associated indicators: Number of direct discharges eliminated / number of direct discharges identified
F5. Reduce input of major rivers and coastal streams followed within the framework of Medpol
Associated indicators: Number of specific plans for reducing inputs from coastal water bodies

These targets are all pressure-specific and potentially measurable. Achievement of GES would depend upon increased pressure-specificity of these targets (i.e. a planned programme with highly specific individual targets for individual sources of pollution). ";Not reported.;- Not reported;0;Not reported
France (Mediterranean);D5;Consistency ;;"The assessments of the pressure and its impacts in the different subregions of France are not fully consistent with the MS definition of GES. Eight indicators are included in the GES definition to monitor various pressures but not all pressures (loads) have been considered in the IA and there are gaps with regard to impacts covered, estimated transboundary inputs from adjacent marine areas and primary-productivity-derived organic loads within the marine sub-regions themselves. It is clear that much of the information provided is from assessments made prior to the development of GES thresholds for the 8 indicators provided, so its utility for assessing GES achievement is limited.

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators set for the North Sea and Bay of Biscay cover most of the different pressures and impacts related to D5 because they are so vaguely defined and lack any orientation towards individual sources of nutrients or organic matter. However, no target is provided for nutrient or dissolved oxygen levels in the sea, or chlorophyll levels and its contribution to reduced water transparency, but reference is made to the achievement of OSPAR objectives. Any reference to individual impacts/indicators is avoided, except to refer to eutrophication itself as an impact. For the Mediterranean, there is a need to define specific targets for D5 to better cover eutrophication-relevant pressures and increase their specificity with regard to individual sources of nutrients and organic matter. 

It is not possible to know whether the targets will lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts considering the lack of quantification.  It is clear that the targets provide no greater impetus to reducing eutrophication pressures and impacts than pre-existing objectives/targets. As a conclusion, it is unlikely that the targets defined are sufficient to achieve GES considering the lack of numerical values. The targets offer no more protection against marine eutrophication than the current OSPAR objectives. ";;;;
France (Mediterranean);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has defined GES for both criteria (although without expanding on the Commission Decision’s wording) and for two indicators. Indicators 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 have been elaborated but none of the indicators for criterion 6.2 have been used. For indicators 6.2.1 through to 6.2.4, France states that they will be developed through further studies. The timeframe provided for the further development of these indicators is the same as for D1 and D4, as per Article 4 of the Ministerial Order. In addition, further information is provided in the accompanying document on the activities planned in the short term (2012-2013) for the further elaboration of the indicators of criterion 6.2. 

The definition of GES itself does not refer to relevant RSC approaches or international agreements but the accompanying text does cite that the approach for D6 in France has been developed within the framework of OSPAR (IGS-COBAM and ICG-MSFD).

In the main GES definition, there is mention of the substrate types the GES definition addresses (apart from a general mention of “engineer species”) but biogenic substrates are mentioned under criterion 6.1. In the accompanying document France refers to the habitats selected for D1 and D4 as those also selected for D6, to be considered in combination with the pressure areas for D6. In the reporting sheet however, France mentions that its GES definition covers “All Seabed Habitats”, which is more in line with the objectives of D6. 

In the GES definition, France uses general terms such as “significant impact”. However, under Criterion 6.1 a quantitative approach to determine the GES boundaries is proposed (% of area occupied by biogenic substrate acted on by pressure physical damage), but without providing an actual numerical limit value. This is justified in the accompanying document by the state of current knowledge, which does not allow yet for the development of limit values. 

The definition at the indicator level does not mention baselines, reference conditions or deviation from some acceptable condition. The main general definition touches on this, stating that the rate and intensity of physical pressures should not exceed “levels presented in Annex 2 of this order” but it is not clear what this refers to as no specific levels for the pressures are presented in Annex 2 of the Order. Finally, it seems that only “physical” pressures are addressed by the GES definition and no mention is made of other types of pressures (e.g. NIS, lack of oxygen from eutrophication, contaminants/oil spills, hydrological changes), which cumulative impacts may affect seafloor habitats.";The GES definition for D6 by France is considered partially adequate. The definition covers all Commission Decision criteria and indicators for criterion 6.1. An attempt is made to quantify criterion 6.1 by proposing an approach to determine GES boundaries but without providing actual values. Indicators for 6.2 are absent and the criterion is only addressed in vague terms. At this stage, more details would have been expected for criterion 6.2. The condition of the benthic community is one of the most studied and well-documented aspects of biodiversity, across most of Europe. For this criterion, WFD indicators should have been mentioned (at least the methods, if not the interpretation scale). This is relevant especially for indicators 6.2.1 (indicator species) and 6.2.2 (multi-metric indices of benthic community structure). These are internationally used for almost any inspections of municipal effluent, aquaculture etc., and have also been applied at a pan-European scale. ;"- Partial coverage of criterion 6.2

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

For the Mediterranean subregion, France provides a similar assessment as for the North Sea and Bay of Biscay. It considers all relevant types of loss and damage that have occurred and provides a quantified description of the extent of the various activities causing the pressures (or the volume of material for physical damage) and the relevant areas in which the pressures occur. France does not provide a quantified assessment of the level of the pressure caused by these activities but provides a qualitative judgement. For both physical loss and physical damage, France considers the pressures as significant and localised on the littoral or the coast. As for the other subregions, it is not clear how it has reached that conclusion. In the reporting sheets, France does not list the activities causing loss and damage in the Mediterranean but from the description, it can be concluded that ports, land claim defence, pipelines, aquaculture, solid waste disposal, fisheries and offshore structures are the main activities causing physical loss and damage.  

With regard to the impacts from physical loss and damage on seabed habitats, France provides a description of the activities responsible for these, the extent of these activities and the habitats mostly affected. It only provides information on the types of pressures causing the impacts to a limited extent. It also provides a list of predominant habitat types mostly affected by the pressure, according to the predefined classification. Cross reference should be made with the assessment for biological features where specific habitats are listed which are subject to physical loss and damage. No quantified assessment is made of the impacts on habitats (e.g. extent of habitats impacted), only a qualitative judgement is provided. For physical loss France judges the impacts on mediolittoral biocenoses to be high and the impacts on bathyal and abyssal sediment to be significant but it is not clear how France reaches these conclusions or what the difference between high and significant impacts is. For physical damage, France assesses that the level of impact on infra- and circalittoral sediments is high, and significant on infra- and circalittoral hard substrates and bathyal and abyssal sediments. Again, it is not explained how France makes these judgements.

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
The reporting of habitat types in the Mediterranean is very similar to that for the Atlantic subregions. The main pressures on each habitat type have been identified and include physical loss, marine litter, introduction of NIS, physical disturbance, loss and damage, extraction of species and introduction of hazardous substance. As for the Atlantic subregions, the status of the habitat’s distribution, extent and condition are not assessed. France provides the same justification as regard the lack of data as for the Atlantic subregions but no future plans. In several instances, France provides a partial assessment of the status of habitat types. In a few cases, France refers to EU standards to make this judgement (e.g. reference to the assessment undertaken for Article 17 of the Habitats Directive for shallow sublittoral mixed sediment and shelf sublittoral rock and biogenic reef or reference to the WFD for shelf waters) although the predominant habitats selected for the purpose of this initial assessment do not correspond to those under the Habitats Directive or the WFD. In other cases (e.g. shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef), France just provides a conclusive statement that status is good or bad in certain areas of the subregions but it is not clear how it reaches this conclusion and it acknowledges that it has not carried out a region-wide assessment.  There is no reference to UNEP/MAP.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures:
The initial assessment of the pressures of physical loss and physical damage in the Mediterranean marine region of France is considered partially adequate. Only a limited amount of information is provided and the only quantification is of the extent of the marine activities causing the pressure. The level of, and impacts from, the pressures are not quantified. A qualitative judgement is made but it is not clear how France reaches these conclusions.

Features:
Overall the assessment of biological features by France for the Mediterranean marine region is considered partially adequate. For habitats, France has not reported on all relevant habitat types. France describes the habitat types reported in quite some details and provides, for some of them, a qualitative judgement on their status in reference to assessments carried out under other processes such as the Habitats Directive and the WFD. For species/functional groups, France describes the groups reported in quite some details but does not make a judgement on the overall status of the species/functional groups. As for the Atlantic subregions, it does provide a judgement on the status of specific species recognized as endangered or threatened according to various EU, RSC and international agreements. However, these ad hoc judgements should be consolidated into a more concise judgement of status. France frequently refers to the in-depth analysis made in its initial assessment paper reports. The consistency check shows that similar type of information is reported in the paper report as in the reporting sheets (but more detailed) and no judgement is made on the status of the species/functional groups.

France (Mediterranean);D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"GES for Descriptor 7 is defined in the reporting sheets only at descriptor and indicator levels, which is explained by the fact that France integrates the criteria defined in the Commission Decision in its general definition at descriptor level. In Annex 2 of the Ministerial Order, the GES definition is specified for Criterion 7.1 and indicators 7.1.1, 7.21 and 7.2.2. The absence of direct reference to Criterion 7.2 in the Ministerial Order is strange and not explained, however, it can be considered that Criterion 7.2 is covered considering the use of the two subsequent indicators. 

The definition of GES is not a simple reformulation of the Directive and it covers the whole scope of D7, being set for both criteria, using the indicators of the Commission Decision. France provides a table, accompanying indicator 7.1.1, which identifies the sources of pressure affecting certain hydrographical conditions. This gives an indication of the parameters to be monitored (albeit without any specific, numerical, details). Clear links are made with other MSFD descriptors (in particular D1, D4 and D6). Finally, the definition is fully aligned with the relevant OSPAR approach as described in the accompanying document and it is consistent with the initial assessment. In the accompanying text, France notes in its accompanying document that D7 should not be assessed with reference to a past status but rather with reference to the current environmental status. This is in line with the Commission approach. Finally, in the accompanying document France refers to the EIA and SEA procedures as tools to monitor hydrographical change, in line with the Commission Decision.  

No information is provided on consistency with the WFD hydro-morphologic objectives (for coastal waters) and no indication is given of the threshold values to be used to monitor progress towards achieving or maintaining GES. In addition, France does not provide a definition of generic terms such as “significant” or “permanent” and acknowledges that it will have to be specified at a later stage. In the absence of numerical values, the indicators do not provide further indication of when GES can be considered achieved. France provides some information on the future plans to address these gaps. Most of the gaps can be related to the low level of work done so far on this rather new descriptor, and to the complex relations between this descriptor and other ones.";The definition of GES is considered adequate in light of current state of knowledge on this rather new topic. The GES definition does cover all the criteria and indicators as in the Commission Decision, it is aligned with the OSPAR and Commission approach and consistent with the initial assessment. However, it does not mention the WFD hydro-morphological objectives for coastal areas, where most pressures/impacts relevant for this descriptor are likely to occur and does not provide a definition of “significant impacts” nor a quantitative threshold values (e.g. of the area affected by change) to monitor achievement of (or maintenance at) GES. ;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators

France (Mediterranean);D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the reporting sheets, France reports on the level of pressure from changes in thermal, salinity and current regimes for all four subregions. For all parameters, France reports that the pressure is either localised (e.g. changes in thermal regime from power plants in the North Sea) or inexistent (given the current state of knowledge). France also reports a lack of evidence of any impacts on ecosystem components in the four subregions. France reports a lack of studies and long-term reliable monitoring data to justify the gaps in its assessment (e.g. many impacts still not described). In the reporting sheet, France does not provide any information on plans to address these gaps but it does in the paper reports. This justification is consistent with OSPAR assessment of knowledge gaps (an extensive inventory of existing data and knowledge has been done). For the Mediterranean, France has not referred to the State of the Mediterranean Marine and Coastal Environment, which can be explained by the fact that the document was published in 2013. 

All causes are studied and relevant changes are addressed. France has made a judgement on the level of pressure (low) and of impact (no evidence of impacts) however the relationship between the pressure, the change and the impacts is not clearly described. Despite this, the MS has provided a very serious study based on extensive analysis of existing work and knowledge. Most of gaps can be related to the low level of work done so far on this rather new descriptor, and to the complex relations between this descriptor and other ones.";The initial assessment can be considered adequate in the light of available knowledge. It takes into account the work done by OSPAR and for the WFD and gives a good description of the potential pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 7. The link with other descriptors is addressed, the situation for this descriptor in relation to GES is assessed (e.g. some areas – Bay of Seine – are under pressure), gaps in knowledge (pressure/impact relation, turbidity, etc.) are identified and plans to address these gaps are described (with an overall timeline of 2018).;"- Refers to work done for OSPAR and WFD

France (Mediterranean);D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"France has not defined specific targets for D7 but in the reporting sheet, France indicates that targets A and B are relevant for D7:
Target A. Maintain or restore biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of coastal seabeds (medio, infra and circalittoral)
Target B. Maintain a good status of conservation of habitats of deep submarine canyons

No justification is provided in the paper report for not providing specific targets for D7. The transversal targets A and B are very general, not focused on specific pressures or impacts and are not measurable. The initial assessment and definition of GES have shown that in the Western Mediterranean, human activities (trawling, beach nourishing, artificialisation of coastline) cause strong pressure on turbidity, leading to changes, which can be permanent. No target has been defined to address this issue.  ";Not reported.;"- Not reported

France (Mediterranean);D7;Consistency ;;"France’s assessment of parameters, pressures (nature, level), impacts (impacted components, level of impact) and relations pressures/impacts is consistent with the definition of GES (level of change, environment components to be considered for GES). 

Considering that France did not produce a consistent set of environmental targets and indicators, they do not cover all the different pressures and impacts identified in the initial assessment and would not guarantee to maintain the current level of pressure and impacts, even less lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts. ";;;;
France (Mediterranean);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor level in both the RS and the paper report. In the RS, France justifies the lack of reporting at the level of criteria by stating that the GES is defined in a global way at the level of the descriptor. However, the definition provided does cover the two criteria “concentration of contaminants” and “effects of contaminants”. France has further specified the GES definition at the indicator level in both the RS and the Ministerial Order. 

In the accompanying document to the Ministerial Order, France provides the list of the 85 substances that have been taken into account to define GES. The criteria for the selection of the substances to be measured to determine GES are explained in detail. The list of substances includes: 
1.	WFD Priority substances 
2.	OSPAR priority substances 
3.	PBT substances;
4.	Anti-fouling substances introduced directly into the marine environment, 
5.	Emerging substances: perfluorinated compounds, pharmaceuticals and nanomaterials. 
Two additional criteria are applied to select the substances to be measured to determine GES:
-	Existence of recognised environmental concentrations thresholds; 
-	Existence of a technical guide analysis.

The approach adopted by France for the selection of the contaminants to be measured takes account of the requirements under EU legislation (WFD and EQSD) and under regional conventions (in particular OSPAR but also to a certain extent the Barcelona Convention) and supplements them with additional criteria (e.g. including substances historically followed by the French monitoring networks). The list provided in the Order is comprehensive and covers all priority hazardous substances as defined in EU legislation, regional agreements and additional substances historically monitored in France. It also includes a few substances, known to be of concern in several places in Europe, selected solely for the purpose of the MSFD on the basis of the selection criteria laid out above (BDE 209 (retardant), Methyl_Hg, Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD): aDCBH-, ß-HBCD, ?-HBCD, Tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA-A).  It is not specified which threshold values will be used to measure the concentrations of these substances. Finally, the list in the Order includes any substance accidentally introduced, which has physical effects on biota or biocenosis. 

The GES definition covers the two criteria set in the Commission Decision on the concentration of contaminants and the effects of contaminants. In addition, the indicators to the French definition for D8, as set in Annex 2 of the Order, cover the three indicators laid out in the Commission Decision. 

Concentration of contaminants
The French definition for criterion 8.1 and indicator 8.1.1 sets threshold values for GES to the level of EU standards (EQS) or regional agreements (BAC or EAC) when the EQS don’t exist for certain substances. There is uncertainty as to which standards (EQS or EAC) will be used for the three substances for which an EQS has been set in biota (mercury, HCB and HCBD) as France has not defined a priority order between the EQS and the EAC. It is also unclear what thresholds will be used for those substances selected solely for the purpose of the MSFD and for which no EQS or EAC have been defined. 

One of the indicators of the general GES definition is the concentration of contaminants at top predator level. However France does not specify in the Order or in the accompanying document which predators this might be and which approach would be used to measure the achievement of GES.

Finally, it should be noted that France has chosen to use the OSPAR criteria also in their Mediterranean waters. This is explained by the fact that no common standards/levels have been defined in the Mediterranean region. 

Effects of contaminants
The definition of GES for the effects of contaminants covers the two indicators included in the Commission Decision. France has made an additional effort in defining a list of specific biological effects to be measured, including Imposex, which is the only mandatory effect adopted by OSPAR.  As far as the other effects are concerned, thresholds do exist for some of them but there is no international consensus on these. With regard to the effects caused by acute pollution events, while it is clear that France gives a lot of importance to acute pollution, it has not defined a threshold value to measure the “significance” of the effects from acute pollution. ";The GES definition for D8 is considered adequate. France adequately defines GES for the two criteria and the indicators of the Commission Decision. France provides a comprehensive list of substances covered by the definition. It uses a pragmatic approach using the minimum requirements (EQS) and complementing with the relevant RSC standards but does not provide a priority order between the two approaches for conflicting cases. It should be noted that while OSPAR’s EAC are risk-based (similarly to the EU EQS) and more tailored to marine water assessments than the EQS, the EU requires that the EAC provide an equivalent protection to that theoretically provided by the EQSD. France uses OSPAR’s standards for the Mediterranean but considering that MEDPOL has no criteria of their own, the application of the OSPAR criteria is a reasonable start. However, some assumptions need to be made if the monitored species in the Mediterranean are different from those for which the OSPAR criteria apply.;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators
- Adequate coverage of substances
- Use of EQS 
- Use of OSPAR standards appropriate since no standards exist in the Mediterranean region";3;Adequate
France (Mediterranean);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);The information provided for the assessment of contamination in the Mediterranean is very similar to that of the Atlantic region, with more information provided for the level of the pressure from synthetic substances in functional groups and still no information on the main activities causing the pressure. The judgements made on the level of, and impact from, contamination by hazardous substances are the same for the Mediterranean as for the other subregions. A reference is also made to compliance to international and EU legislation but with no further details. With regard to contamination from radionuclides, the assessment is not based on any European or regional work (as this is inexistent for the Mediterranean) but focuses on a few relevant substances (carbon 60, 137Cs, 7Be and 210Po), which seems adequate. No judgement is made on the impacts from contamination by radionuclides on ecosystem components. ;The initial assessment made by France in relation to contamination by hazardous substances in the Mediterranean subregion is considered partially adequate for same reasons as outlined above for the Atlantic subregions. ;"- Quantitative description of levels of contaminations but no judgement in relation to GES
- Limited assessment on impacts from contamination but no judgement in relation to GES
- Adequate assessment for radionuclides";2;Partially adequate
France (Mediterranean);D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"France has defined two sets of targets and associated indicators dealing with contamination from hazardous substances in the Mediterranean, one for contamination from synthetic and non-synthetic substances and one for acute pollution events. This last aspect has not been covered in the other subregions. In addition, the Mediterranean targets for acute pollution refer to regional cooperation (in the framework of Medpol) and bilateral cooperation with neighbouring countries (RamogePol with Italy and Lion Plan with Spain).  

In general the targets defined for the Mediterranean subregion are much more pressure-specific and measurable than for the other subregions. They cover several important aspects of contamination by hazardous substances, although the targets do not cover contamination by radionuclides (but this is not required by the Directive) and are very limited when it comes to the impacts of contamination on ecosystem components (only one indicator focusing on habitats and it is much too general to be effective). 

No reference is made in the Mediterranean targets to the concentrations of contaminants (and therefore to the EQS or to the OSPAR standards) or to the biological effects of these standards. In addition, information is still lacking on two crucial elements: the threshold values and the baselines to be used to measure progress.";The set of targets and indicators defined by France to cover D8 in the Mediterranean is considered partially adequate. Despite the distinctive efforts made in the Mediterranean to define specific targets and associated indicators, the lack of specifics regarding threshold values and baselines means that it is not possible to assess if the targets will help achieve GES by 2020.In addition, while there is a reference to the initial assessment, there is a clear lack of consistency between the targets set for the Mediterranean and the national definition of GES. ;"- Potentially measurable targets and indicators
- Reference to cooperation with neighbouring countries
- Lack of specifics (threshold values, reference points, baselines)
- Lack of consistency with nationally-defined GES definition";2;Partially adequate
France (Mediterranean);D8;Consistency ;;"The assessments of the pressure and its impacts in the different subregions of France are consistent with the MS definition of GES. In its initial assessment, France provides details of land-, sea- and air-based sources where the hazardous substances of concern are a subset of those addressed under GES.

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators set for the Atlantic subregions cover all pressures and impacts identified in the initial assessment of D8 considering their generic nature but would fail to lead to a reduction in the identified pressures and impacts. Considering that France has not reported on the activities causing the pressure, it is consistent (although inadequate) that they have not defined targets for specific activities. In the case of the Mediterranean, the targets are more specific and would lead to a reduction in the identified pressures and impacts if numerical values (thresholds, baselines) were attached to the indicators developed. As a conclusion, it is unlikely that the targets defined are sufficient to achieve GES.";;;;
France (Mediterranean);D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor, criteria and indicator level in both the RS and the Ministerial Order. 

The definition of GES repeats the Directive and uses guidance of the Commission Decision as far as criterion 9.1 is concerned. For the first part of criterion 9.1 (corresponding to indicator 9.1.1), France includes in its GES definition the threshold values in compliance with existing European legislation, in particular Regulation 1881/2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs. Regulation 1881/2006 is used as a reference for:
-	The list of contaminants addressed in the definition of GES
-	The threshold values (maximum levels) that should not be exceeded  

With regard to the second part of Criterion 9.1, on the annual frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded (indicator 9.1.2), no information is provided in the French Order (Annex 1 or Annex 2) on the threshold value used for this indicator. In the accompanying document, France acknowledges that the threshold for the annual frequency still needs to be determined. It justifies this by mentioning that no consensus on this indicator has been reached across Member States and mentions that the methodology for setting this threshold will be developed at a later stage, on the basis of a hygienic approach to take into account the specificity of D9, which targets human health and not impacts on the marine environment. 

In addition to defining GES for the criterion (and indicators) specified in the Commission Decision, France has defined GES for an additional criterion (9.2) on microbiological contaminants. The EU legislation referred to in the general GES definition is further specified in Annex 2 of the Order and covers all the relevant standards to be applied in this context, including the “hygiene pack”. While the general definition itself is not very specific in terms of the products concerned, a definition of seafood addressed by the definition is provided in the Annex 2 of the Order. France justifies the choice of matrices analysed by stating that these are representative of the consumption of the French population and provides details on the methodology used to make that assumption. 

The links with D8 are mentioned. However, France clearly states that it has not had the opportunity to make a common analysis in the frame of this reporting cycle. No reference is made to the RSCs in the Order but reference is made to the work undertaken in OSPAR in the accompanying document. ";The definition of GES for D9 is considered adequate. France has defined its GES in compliance with the Directive and the Commission Decision (using the same criterion and indicators and the recommended EU standards). Although it has not yet provided the full information that will be used to measure progress towards achieving GES (i.e. lack of threshold value for indicator 9.1.2), it has defined a potentially measurable GES for the number of contaminants and the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded. In addition, France goes one step further than the MSFD/Commission Decision defining GES for criterion 9.2 on contamination by microbial pathogens and using relevant European legislation. This can be considered as a good practice.;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criterion and indicators
- Use of relevant EU standards
- Lack of thresholds for criterion 9.1 
- Inclusion of microbial pathogens in definition of GES (+++)";3;Adequate
France (Mediterranean);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The assessment carried out in the Mediterranean of the contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances is similar to that done for the Atlantic region. It is very limited but concludes that the contamination levels (not specified for which substances) are well-below regulatory levels in bivalves and the impacts on exploited fish, cephalopods, crustaceans and shellfish are moderate. Again, little information is provided on what impacts have been analysed (only the impact of TBT on imposex has been analysed, as reported under the D8 section, which is not relevant for D9). No assessment was made of the contamination of radionuclides on fish and seafood.

With regard to microbial pathogens, the main causes for pressures are identified (urban and agricultural activities) and the level of pressure assessed for both bathing and shellfish waters. However, the trend in the pressure is not assessed. The report underlines a lack of knowledge on the impacts of microbial pathogens on the marine environment. Information is provided on other bacteria e.g. salmonella, listeria, viruses but these are local and punctual data which cannot be generalised to the whole sub-region. There is a judgement on the level of impacts, based on Directive 76/160/EC for bathing waters.";The initial assessment made by France in relation to contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances in the Mediterranean subregion is considered partially adequate for same reasons as outlined above for the Atlantic subregions.;"- Gaps in the analysis of impacts

France (Mediterranean);D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Environmental objectives for the Mediterranean region are not defined by descriptors but rather based on identified issues whether in terms of ecological status or pressures. Three sets of 13 objectives are therefore defined:
-	Five objectives linked to ecological status (this categorisation is itself subdivided into fauna and flora)
-	Four objectives linked to pressures
-	Four transversal objectives (i.e. objectives that should impact on both ecological status and pressures)

No objective is directly related to Descriptor 9 and tackling the issue of seafood contamination. Therefore, no assessment of adequacy has been carried out. In order to be comprehensive, it could be said that a few objectives related to Descriptor 8 are relevant to the analysed elements associated with the Descriptor 9 in the IA. ";Not reported.;"- Not reported

France (Mediterranean);D9;Consistency ;;"The assessments of the pressure and its impacts, including contamination from microbial pathogens, in the different subregions of France are consistent with the MS definition of GES. The threshold values used for the assessment of the current levels of contamination are the same as those used in the GES definition. 

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators set for the Atlantic subregions cover the two main types of contamination addressed by D9 (microbiological and chemical contamination). It is not possible to know whether the targets will lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts considering the lack of quantification.

It is also consistent that France has not set targets for the Mediterranean region considering that it has found that levels of contaminants in fish and seafood are “well below” threshold values. However, it would have been adequate to set targets to ensure that good status is maintained until 2020 and that the status is not degraded. ";;;;
France (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has defined the good environmental status for Descriptor 1 at descriptor, criteria and indicator level. In the reporting sheet, GES is defined only at the descriptor and criteria levels in the priority fields; the indicators specified in Annex 2 of the Ministerial Order have been reported in the field “Assessment Method”. 

The GES definition for D1 applies to all French marine subregions. The GES definition is not a simple reformulation of the Annex 1 of the Directive. Due attention has been paid to each criterion and all but two of the associated indicators (1.1.3 and 1.7.1) are included in the GES definition. The definition of GES does not include direct reference to existing European or regional standards. However, the additional text in the Order cross-links the criteria and indicators to relevant EU and international agreements (including the Habitats Directive). 

In the reporting sheets, the GES definition for the various criteria is linked to either “all functional groups” or “all seabed and water column habitats”. This is in line with the objective of the D1 as defined in the Directive, which aims to address all biodiversity elements. In the paper report, France provides the list of predominant habitats and functional groups covered by the French definition for D1. These lists include all of those listed in the classification referenced in EC 2012 . For predominant habitats, France defines two additional “zones” that should be considered, compatible with the Habitats Directive and OSPAR classifications (land and transitional zones). 

In addition to covering all predominant habitats and functional groups, France provides the criteria defined for the selection of habitats and species to be covered by D1. France mentions that selecting a specific list of habitats and species will facilitate the assessment of environmental and anthropogenic pressures and assessment of status as well as facilitate comparison with neighbouring countries. It mentions that the lists should evolve in time in order to select the local or international elements that are the most relevant. 

For the selection of specific species and habitats, France uses the criteria defined by the OSPAR Texel-Faial approach as well as the listed habitats and species as per the Habitats and Birds Directives, the OSPAR and Barcelona Conventions and national SSSI (sites of special scientific interest) (the Bonn Convention and the ASCOBANS and ACCOBAMS agreements are also mentioned in the accompanying document). The criteria also include habitats and species with a particular sensitivity to anthropogenic pressures, habitats with a key functional role and key species from a functional point of view, common species and habitats, rare or declining species or habitats. France mentions that the habitats and species which will be covered by D1 will be specified, on the basis of these criteria, following further studies (as per Article 4 of the Order). The selection is used as a basis to assess all functional groups and predominant habitats. 

The general principles of Favourable Conservation Status (of Habitats Directive) and Good Ecological Status (as in the WFD) are reflected in the definition of GES, although there is no direct reference to either. Only in the accompanying text is the Habitats Directive referred to and the WFD is not mentioned at all. There is a good reference to habitat connectivity in the GES definition and the text does build on indicator 1.7.1, even though it is not further defined. A clear reference is made to “existing natural environmental conditions”, related to natural biological variation as well as climate change, as the baseline for the definition of GES. This is in line with the text of Descriptor 1 in Annex I of the Directive, which mentions “prevailing physiographic, geographic and climate conditions”. The definition of GES therefore recognises that there is natural/climatic variation and ecosystem dynamics, and so does not seek a rigid state for particular biodiversity components. 

The definitions at descriptor and criteria levels are clear that there should not be further deterioration in biodiversity by stating that biodiversity or specific features of biodiversity should be ‘preserved’, should ‘not decrease significantly’ or should be ‘maintained’. Acceptable deviation from reference conditions is partly addressed in that human activities and pressures should be at a level consistent with the ability of the ecosystem to be ecologically resilient. However, the concept of ecological resilience of the ecosystem is vague and it is unclear how it can be measured. There is sufficient understanding that it is ecosystem sustainability which is the aim, not continual increase in biodiversity. 

Threshold values are not directly mentioned. The reliance on “further studies” to determine the levels and the timeframes of the “parameters” associated with each indicators, as per Article 4 of the Ministerial Order, is not entirely clear. Article 4 of the Ministerial Order mentions that the definition of GES shall be updated every six years from the date of its adoption. This seems to indicate that the threshold values and baselines associated to each indicator (parameters) will only be integrated into the definition of GES in 2018 (if they have been defined by then).";"The definition of GES for D1 by France is considered partially adequate. There is an adequate coverage of the criteria and indicators. The GES definition addresses all biodiversity components in the same way and reference is made to the relevant predominant habitats and functional groups addressed by GES. However the descriptions are all purely qualitative (no quantification), and there is no sense of an aim to identify specific standards which need to be enforced. For some of the indicators, relevant EcoQOs could have been used (OSPAR has set leading examples; some of these may also be applicable at least to some sub-regions of this MS). The GES definition is not sufficiently specific to judge when GES has been achieved, unless more specific details are included in the targets (e.g. what is meant with ensuring the integrity of the ecological functions of habitats).

France (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
France has reported for birds and mammals at the level of the species group. In addition, it has reported on the following functional groups: turtles, demersal, diadromous, pelagic and deep-sea fish. It has not reported on cephalopods species/groups and no justification is provided for this gap, although this is justified by the current state of knowledge. No assessment is made for individual species in the reporting sheets although they are referenced in the paper report and within the descriptions of the species/functional groups.

The main pressures have been reported for each species/functional group. These include for the North Sea and Bay of Biscay introduction of hazardous substances, extraction of species, marine litter, physical loss, underwater noise (mammals in the North Sea) and nutrient enrichment. For the Celtic Sea, only the extraction of species (all) has been reported as a pressure on species/functional groups. 

For each of the features reported, France has provided a qualitative description of the group's condition and relative abundance and a qualitative judgement on the overall status of the group. In the description of the relative abundance of the features, qualitative trends are sometimes provided (e.g. populations of migratory species of diadromous fish have decreased because of anthropogenic pressures) and in a few cases a quantification of the populations’ abundance is done. In most cases, France provides the lists of the species considered within the species/functional group. 

In terms of assessment of status, in general only a qualitative assessment is made for the overall status of the group. France only concludes on the status of a few species but refers to the lack of coherent and aggregated data to justify the lack of judgement on the status of the group as whole at the level of the subregion. To make an assessment of status for certain species, France refers to various international organisations/agreements (including ICES, IUCN, CITES). It also refers to assessments done under the Habitats Directive for certain species (mammal species in the Bay of Biscay and the Celtic Sea and turtles in the Celtic Sea) but it is often concludes that the status of the group is unknown. It also refers to the listed species of OSPAR. Finally, it refers to its own national lists of endangered species. It should be noted that these references are made only for the Bay of Biscay and Celtic Sea subregions. The assessment of biological features in the North Sea does not refer to any regional, EU or international approach. 

France notes that the scale of the subregion is not always relevant to make an assessment of the status of populations of marine mammals or for pelagic fish and that a larger assessment area would need to be defined. 

Habitats
For all habitats, France has acknowledged that it has not made a comprehensive assessment but provides a description, which contains a very rudimentary assessment. For the Atlantic subregions, only some habitat types have been reported and there is no justification why other habitats, which do occur in the sub-regions, are not included. However France does acknowledge that there are gaps in its assessment, which will be addressed in the next reporting cycle. No assessment is made for special habitats in the reporting sheets although they are referenced in the paper report. In the reporting sheets, France has reported on the following predominant habitats: littoral rock and biogenic reef, littoral sediment, shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shallow sublittoral mixed sediment, shelf sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shelf sublittoral mixed sediment and marine water: shelf. For seabed habitats, it covers most of the main zones (littoral, shallow, shelf) except the deep sea (bathyal/abyssal) zones, and does not address some sediment types. 

France describes the distribution, extent and condition of the habitat types reported in quite some details, including quantitative information (e.g. for the geographical distribution and extent of the habitats) and qualitative trends in the habitats’ condition. The main pressures on each habitat type have been identified. The pressures on habitats in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay subregions include introduction of NIS, introduction of hazardous substances, nutrient enrichment, marine litter, physical disturbance, damage and loss and extraction of species. In the Celtic Sea, only the extraction of species (all) is reported as a pressure on habitat types. 

The status of each habitat’s distribution, extent and condition are not assessed. France justifies this by stating that because of the lack of assessment criteria at the scale of the subregion and because the information collected is fragmented and heterogeneous, it has not been possible to assess the overall status of the habitats. In some cases, France provides a limited assessment of the status of a particular habitat type (e.g. deterioration of coastal limestone habitats in the North Sea region). For shelf waters, France refers to the assessments carried out in the framework of the WFD, although shelf waters would typically occur beyond the scope of the WFD, and provides a qualitative judgement on the status of the waters. 

Ecosystems
France has not assessed ecosystems. ";Overall the assessment of biological features by France for the Atlantic marine region is considered partially adequate. For habitats, France has not reported on all relevant habitat types. France describes habitat types in quite some details but does not make a judgement on the status of the habitat types it reports. For species/functional groups, France did not report on all expected/relevant groups although it covers the main groups relatively well. France describes the species/functional groups in quite some details but does not make a judgement on the overall status of the groups. It does however provide an assessment of status for specific species recognized as endangered or threatened according to various EU, RSC and international agreements. However, these ad hoc assessments should be consolidated into a more concise judgement of status. France frequently refers to the in-depth analysis made in its initial assessment paper reports. The consistency check shows that similar type of information is reported in the paper report as in the reporting sheets (but more detailed) and no judgement is made of the status of the species/functional groups. The justification provided by France (limited and fragmented data) should have been complemented by details regarding future plans. Only a general sentence on the review of the assessment of the next reporting cycle is provided by France. ;"Features:

France (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"All targets are general statements of GES and are not sufficiently specific. No impacts or pressures have been identified as needing specific action. No baselines, reference points or threshold values are defined, making them not measurable. Although the timescale for achieving the target is defined (2020 for the Bay of Biscay and the Celtic Sea and 2018 for the North Sea – the latter actually corresponding to the date when the targets should be revised rather than the timescale of achievement of the target), without further details as to the process involved, it is difficult to see whether they are achievable. No reference to existing international, national or RSC targets is made in the targets. However, references to the OSPAR lists of species (but not habitats) are made in the paper reports. Although it is understood that some criteria and indicators for D1 are in a state of development, it is not explained why: 
?	No targets have been set to address the GES definitions at indicator level for D1.1, D1.2 and D1.4 (and D1.3 for the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay).
?	No targets have been set to address the GES definitions at criteria level for D1.5, D1.6 and D1.7 (it is however understood that targets for D1.7 may overlap with D4)

In addition, the following information is not found in the targets:
?	Which habitats for the relevant part of the sub-region have a key functional role
?	A specification of rare or threatened species relevant to the subregions (e.g. taken from national red-lists, habitat mapping and OSPAR 2008)
?	Which species and habitats of ecological importance should be permanently preserved and in which areas (MPA's or Marine Nature Reserves) (specific to North Sea) 
?	Clarification of what “maintain” and “good conservation” mean and relating this to a quantitative description of a target state. 
?	A list of the habitats of community interest in the subregions
?	A list of common habitats and species relevant for the subregions

While there is a clear lack of specific information in the definitions of the targets, more information is provided in the paper report for the North Sea subregion, for instance citing examples of habitats with a key functional role. The targets all aim to achieve some form of desirable state (“good conservation” or “preserved”) but no specific information is given as to how pressures and impacts should be reduced, or even where these should be reduced. Further, no information is given linking pressures and negative impacts on biodiversity (which need reversing). ";The set of environmental targets and indicators defined for D1 is considered inadequate. None of the targets is SMART. All the targets seem to set out objectives of GES, rather than constituting actual targets, with some indication of which aspects of biodiversity should be given priority for protection. Information listed in the bullet points above should have been provided in order to make for more realistic targets. The targets are not sufficiently ambitious to reduce the pressures or impacts to levels that will achieve GES (if possible by 2020) because they do not directly address pressures and impacts. ;"- Set out objectives of GES, rather than constituting actual targets
- Not SMART (lack of threshold values and baselines)
- Do not directly address pressures or impacts";1;Inadequate
France (North East Atlantic);D1;Consistency ;;"Considering that the GES definitions for D1, 4 and 6 are general and address all features, the features assessed in the initial assessment are consistent with the GES definitions for biodiversity. The assessment of pressures, physical loss and damage, is also consistent with the GES definition for D1 and D6. Although there is a lack of consistency in the reporting sheets between what is reported under the physical loss/damage pressures and the inclusion of these pressures as impacting certain habitat types. However, the pressures addressed under the D1 definition are much broader than just physical loss and damage (e.g. fisheries, eutrophication, contaminants, NIS, etc.) These are also covered by the French initial assessment and are assessed in the following sections of the present report. 

With regard to the targets for the Atlantic subregions, these are so general that it can be considered that they cover all the features included in the initial assessment but the link between the conclusions from the initial assessment (e.g. on the bad status of a particular element when it has been assessed) and the targets is not made. For the Mediterranean region, the specificity of the targets indicates a closer link between the IA and the targets defined. Although it is not in the scope of this assessment to verify that each target defined for the Mediterranean finds grounds in the full IA for the Mediterranean (paper report), the consistency check carried out indicates that this is the case. 

There is also a lack of consistency between the extensive but too general GES definitions and the limited and still too general targets. In particular the targets defined for the Atlantic subregions clearly do not cover all aspects of the GES definitions. On the other hand, considering that the GES definitions for all three descriptors are without GES boundaries and baselines, it could have been expected that the targets defined include these elements, in order to introduce some form of specificity. ";;;;
France (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in both the reporting sheet and the Ministerial Order. All criteria and indicator laid out for Descriptor 10 in the Commission Decision are incorporated. 

France has developed the GES concept further for marine litter, especially at descriptor level. The GES definition aims at zero-impact of marine litter on a number of aspects of which the most important are the impact on marine life at the population level and as driver for the introduction of invasive species. In addition, marine litter should have no adverse consequences for human health and have no adverse economic consequences for maritime activities, industries, coastal communities and navigation. The zero-impact of marine litter can be achieved when waste and their degradation products existing in and entering the sub-marine region are significantly reduced over time. France is not only targeting existing waste in the marine environment, but also targets new waste entering the marine environment. A baseline and threshold values have not yet been set. 

For the North-East Atlantic region, France is referring and using data from the relevant OSPAR initiatives and monitoring programmes with respect to marine litter, i.e. the monitoring programmes on beach litter, the Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) on plastic particles in Fulmars’ (Fulmarus glacialis) stomachs and seabed trawling. With the respect to the Mediterranean, reference is not made to UNEP/MAP MED POL. On the other hand, UNEP/MAP MED POL has only recently started to develop a common approach for marine litter. In absence of the Fulmar, the indicators for the impact on marine life still have to be defined. ";Even though a quantification of the GES definition is still needed, it is considered that the current GES definition, given the available knowledge, is adequate. France has defined GES for D10 for all criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision and has even gone one step further. In addition, it is referring to the relevant regional standards. ;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators
- Use of relevant RSC standards
- Lack of quantification (but in line with state of knowledge)";3;Adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"France reports a substantial knowledge base with respect to marine litter, especially for the Channel North Sea and the Bay of Biscay. Data availability for the Celtic Seas is less. For the Channel North Sea and the Bay of Biscay, France reports substantive results from beach litter monitoring, waste densities on the seabed by bottom trawling, and the impact of marine life, covering birds (Fulmars), sea turtles, marine mammals. In addition, regional differentiation is made within both sub-regions for waste on shorelines and seabed litter. In the Celtic Sea, data is only available for seabed litter. Statistical data on sea birds is not available. The Ouessant Island is the only land mass in the Celtic Sea subregion, for which data on beach litter is not available. For all three sub-regions, zones of high accumulation of seabed litter are reported. France also reports data gaps on marine litter in the water column and on the impact of marine litter on seabed habitats. Plans to address data gaps are not described and are reported as being ‘under discussion’. 

In addition to reporting on the state of marine litter, France also reports on the major pressures (sources) of marine litter. For the Channel North Sea and the Bay of Biscay, important sources of marine litter are discharge of waste by rivers, port activities, maritime transport incl. loss of cargo. For the Bay of Biscay, the relationship between the loss of ship cargo and marine litter in the water column and seabed is demonstrated. Fishing activities are reported as a major source of marine litter, but at the same time fishing areas are also reported as being sensitive to marine litter. As a consequence of the limited landmass, the Celtic Seas sub-region is not subject to the pressure of big cities, industrial areas or rivers. However, the impact of fisheries and maritime transport is demonstrated by means of the composition of waste in the high accumulation zone of seabed litter at the Peak of Brittany. Mussel aquaculture is a particular pressure in the Channel North Sea. 

In all three sub-regions, France refers to relevant OSPAR initiatives, notably beach litter monitoring, waste densities on the seabed by bottom trawling, fishing for litter and the impact of marine life including OSPAR's EcoQO on the ingestion of plastic by Fulmars, but also by sea turtles and marine mammals. ";The initial assessment made by France of pollution by marine litter is considered adequate for the Atlantic marine region. France reports a substantial knowledge base with respect to marine litter, both on the level of the pressure and the impacts from the pressure on ecosystem components. It also refers to relevant OSPAR initiatives and standards.;"- Substantial knowledge base reported (level of and impacts from pressure)
- Refers to relevant RSC standards
- No judgement but expected in light of current knowledge";3;Adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"A consistent set of three environmental targets is reported by France aiming to reduce the inflows of waste (at source) into the marine environment, remove the waste already residing in the marine environment and reduce the impact of waste on marine life and their habitats. 

The targets address state, pressures and impacts. Yet, the targets are insufficiently detailed and are, as reported, not measurable. Associated indicators have not been defined nor are baseline and threshold values. France aims to achieve the targets by 2018 for the Channel North Sea and 2020 for the Bay of Biscay and Celtic Sea, but it is not clear what the motivation is behind the different deadlines.

In addition, the terminology chosen is unclear. Target 10.2 aims to “significantly” reduce the amount of waste while the other targets “just” want to reduce the waste. This seems to be a first indication of the difference in ambition between the targets.

For the Channel North Sea sub-region, Target 10.1 is further subdivided in three subsidiary targets, targeting the inflow of waste by rivers and the waste production and discharge at sea and on the coast. It is not clear why these three pressure targets do not also apply for the other two subregions, as they would have been equally relevant. 

For the Celtic Seas and the Bay of Biscay, Target 10.2 is further specified. France will focus especially on areas with heavy accumulations of waste. Evidence for accumulation zones of floating and seabed litter is reported in the initial assessment, which shows the link between the initial assessment and the setting of target. 
";For all three subregions, even though the targets cover all aspects and are ambitious, they are considered partially adequate, mainly due to the insufficient detail and lack of measurability. It is recommended to define associated indicators, thereby further clarifying which type of waste pathways and marine components are targeted.;"- All aspects covered
- Relatively high level of ambition
- Insufficient details (threshold values, baselines) and lack of measurability";2;Partially adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D10;Consistency ;;"The GES definition is much wider than the Initial Assessment allowed for, despite the substantial data availability. France is considered ambitious and reports an all-inclusive GES definition. Data is mostly available for beach litter, seabed litter and the impact on marine life in both the North-East Atlantic region and the Mediterranean. Zones of accumulation for floating litter and on the seabed have been reported in both marine regions. The envisaged reduced impact on socio-economic sectors and communities, human health and invasive species, as mentioned in the GES definition, has only been covered indirectly by the Initial Assessment and the set of targets. 

For the Channel North Sea, through involvement in OSPAR, the Fulmar programme has led to the existence of knowledge and data on the impact of ingested marine litter on Fulmars. For the Mediterranean, Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay, in absence of the Fulmars, other indicators have to be developed. The reported data from sea turtles and sea mammals in the initial assessment gives an indication of potential indicator organisms. For the Celtic Seas, data availability is limited. While ample reference is given to OSPAR, the Mediterranean regional sea convention is not mentioned.

In both regions, the set of targets addresses important sources of marine litter and has moved beyond the state indicators as described in the Commission Decision. France has defined promising tools that can assist in achieving GES. Yet, a baseline and threshold values still have be set for GES and targets. While the GES definition is equal and reporting for the initial assessment is similar, the main difference between the reporting of both regions is the level of detail of the targets. On the one hand, targets for the North-East Atlantic Ocean are insufficiently precise, not measurable and lack associated indicators. On the other hand, the targets for the Mediterranean are well-focused and measurable, through well-defined associated indicators. The set of targets and associated indicators is not sufficient to achieve GES, considering the lack of quantification, but France is on its way to make them sufficient.";;;;
France (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor level, criteria and indicator levels. Both criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 11 in the Commission Decision are incorporated. At descriptor level, France has developed the GES concept for underwater noise further. GES is achieved when the abundance, mortality risk, detection and communication behaviour of sensitive species is not affected by underwater noise. France has identified Cetaceans and Pinnipeds as species sensitive to disturbance by underwater noise. The ‘functional ecological zones’ will be used as scale of evaluation.

The indicators are precisely cited from the Commission Decision. In addition, for indicator 11.2.1 (continuous low frequency sound), France also includes important sources of underwater noise, namely coastal and deep-sea shipping, nautical activities using noise emitters, e.g. for oil and gas exploration, and sea construction works. Reference to the Regional Sea Conventions is not reported. The baseline, trends and threshold values will be further developed, with an overall deadline of 2018 set globally for the review of the French marine strategy. ";The GES definition for D11 by France is considered adequate, although it is unrealistic to consider that France will be able to assess that it has achieved GES by 2020 under the current provisions, taking into account the limited data availability for underwater noise.;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators
- Use of relevant approaches
- Lack of quantification (but in line with current state of knowledge)";3;Adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"France reports that the level of impulsive sounds has decreased substantially within the last 20 years in the North East Atlantic Ocean, as direct consequence of the limited success of oil and gas exploration.  For the Channel North Sea and the Celtic Seas, continuous sound due to shipping is high with some detailed observations and a reference describing the effect of the economic recession in 2008/2009 on shipping traffic and hence underwater noise.  Limited information is reported for the Bay of Biscay. 

France reports the most important source of underwater noise, even though aggregate dredging in most cases is no considered as an impulsive sound source. A spatial assessment has not be been done. Baseline and thresholds value still have to be set. ";Given the current state of knowledge, the initial assessment on underwater noise for the Atlantic marine region of France is considered adequate. France provides an adequate level of information on the sources of noise, including past and current trends. ;"- Relevant information reported considering current state of knowledge
- No spatial assessment and no judgement in relation to GES (but expected in light of current knowledge)";3;Adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"France reports three environmental targets on underwater sound for the North Sea, and one additional for the Bay of Biscay and Celtic Sea. Why this additional target has not been set for the North Sea is not clear, especially considering that the information reported in the initial assessment does not pinpoint to a specific problem in the Bay of Biscay and Celtic Sea. 

The targets are not measurable and can be considered as a further specification of the GES definition. It is assumed that the statement ‘impact on the species’ refers to the sensitive species as identified in the GES definition, but the latter is not clearly described.";The targets are considered to be partially adequate. They are in line with the indicators as set forth in the Commission Decision but they need further specification, especially to make them measurable.;"- In line with the Commission Decision indicators
- Not measurable (lack of threshold values and baseline)

";2;Partially adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D11;Consistency ;;The GES definition and the assessment of pressures and impact are considered consistent. The state of underwater noise is linked to the activities that are the main source of underwater sound. In general, most information is reported for the Channel North Sea and the Celtic Seas. Less is reported for the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean. The environmental targets can be considered as a further specification of the GES definition and needs to be further specified. It is furthermore unclear why different targets are proposed for the North East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean.;;;;
France (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 2 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in both the paper report (Ministerial Order) and the reporting sheet. The definition at descriptor level reproduces verbatim the definition of Annex I of the MSFD. At the criteria level, the French definition is more specific. At indicator level, the definitions reproduce literally the wording of the Commission Decision, but are set only for indicators 2.1.1 and 2.2.2. Indicator 2.2.1 on the ratio between invasive NIS and native species in relation to change in species composition is not included. 

The French report further indicates that parameters associated to the indicator, as well as the levels and trends corresponding to GES will be defined for both criteria following complementary research in time for the update of GES definition by 2018. The Ministerial Order (Annex 2) specifies that the relevant assessment unit for criteria 2.1 is individual species, simply stating that these are those species which presence has been identified in marine sub-regions. For criterion 2.2, the relevant assessment unit will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the particular NIS and its known or potential impacts. The list of species is to be drawn on the basis of complementary studies. ";The GES definition for D2 is considered as inadequate. At descriptor and indicator level, the French definition merely reproduces the definition set by the Directive and the Commission Decision. There is no baseline. GES is defined in very general terms. The frequency and intensity of new introductions of NIS through human activities should be reduced to a minimum, which is considered as a minimum requirement (which means that NIS can still be introduced), without defining thresholds or reference conditions and baselines.;"- At descriptor and indicator level, mere reproduction of MSFD and Commission Decision definitions

France (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"North Sea
A list of 97 NIS is provided, indicating for all of them whether or not there are invasive species, and for some, the country/area of origin and date first recorded. The two main pathways are aquaculture (29% of NIS introductions) and shipping (13% from ballast waters and 8% from biofouling. An estimation of abundance has been provided only for one species (crassostrea gigas) and only for a limited area. 

The impacts of the pressure are identified in the seabed and functional groups but not in the water column. The proportion of impacted features is not assessed. No judgement has been done of the level of pressure and the trend in pressure and of the level of impact of NIS. France states that due consideration will be given to these knowledge gaps in the framework of the revisions of the different elements for the next cycle, that is 2018, there is no further indication in terms of concrete actions and responsibilities.

Celtic Seas
A list of 20 NIS is provided, indicating for some of them whether or not there are invasive species, country/area of origin and date first recorded. Most species are potentially present in the sub-region as present in both North and South Brittany. Only for a very limited number, country/area of origin and pathway are indicated. 

An assessment of the level of pressure on the environment is carried out but there is no trend of the level of pressure reported. An assessment of the impacts on water column, seabed and functional groups is provided, concluding to no significant impacts. This is justified by the fact that this particular marine sub-region is not concerned by NIS introduction as introduction vectors are quasi inexistent and bathymetric and oceanographic conditions are not favourable to the most commonly transported NIS. The only documented example of NIS introduction through aquaculture is the brown alguae Undaria pinnatifida and the introduction through maritime transport is not significant in the sub-region.

Bay of Biscay
A list of 129 NIS is provided, indicating for some of them whether or not there are invasive species, country/area of origin and date first recorded. The two main pathways are aquaculture and shipping, although France indicates that 40% of the introduction vectors are unknown or very uncertain.

An assessment of the level of pressure on the environment is carried out but there is no trend of the level of pressure reported and the information is generally limited. Impacted features are not all identified. There are no water column features reported (unknown) but only seabed and functional groups. The proportion of impacted features is not assessed. There is no trend reported on the level of impact. No global assessment or judgement has been done at the level of the sub-region. France states that due consideration will be given to these knowledge gaps in the framework of the revisions of the different elements for the next cycle, that is 2018, there is no further indication in terms of concrete actions and responsibilities.";The initial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered adequate for the three NEA subregions. For the Celtic Sea subregion, France states that there are no NIS. However it should be noted that there is no follow-up and control of NIS at the subregional scale. For the other two subregions, the information appears relatively complete in the light of what can be expected for Descriptor 2. France has provided a list of NIS and information on the level of pressure. The main pathways are identified and described.  However, there is no judgement of the status in relation to GES and the assessment of impacts is limited. Knowledge gaps are described but plans for addressing those are vague.;"- List of NIS provided

France (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"In all three marine sub-regions, only two general targets have been set without specific target or associated indicator.

The first target is a pressure-target. It is not considered as a SMART target as while it can be considered as specific (reduce risk) and time-bound (December 2020), it is not measurable, achievable and realistic. Combined with the vague definitions of GES, there is no quantification, thresholds, reference conditions and baseline. No specification is given as to how to reduce the risk, to which levels and which sectors or pathways to address.

The same remarks apply to the second target, which is an impact-target. It only requires a general reduction of impacts and does not give any information on how to reduce those and which vectors and pathways to address.";This set of two general targets is considered as inadequate to achieve GES, which is itself defined in a rather vague way.

France (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 3 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in both the paper report (Ministerial Order) and the RS. The Descriptor definition for France is the same as that provided in the Commission Decision, for Descriptor 3. In the case of Descriptor 3 this is an acceptable practice. All Descriptor 3 criteria as laid out in the Commission Decision are incorporated and specific indicators have been identified for each. Only indicators 3.3.2 and 3.3.4 seem to be missing. Criterion 3.3 has been copied directly from the Commission Decision without any modifications while criterion 3.1 and 3.2 are specified further. 

In the Ministerial Order, France makes clear reference to relevant EU legislation. References to the work of ICES are made in the accompanying document. Details of the stocks covered by the GES definition for each marine subregion are included in the Ministerial Order but there is a lack of multispecies assessment in general.  

Criterion 3.1
The French GES definition for indicator 3.1.1 “Fishing mortality” does not follow the guidelines from the Commission Decision that Fmsy should be set as a limit rather than a target. The use of Fpa as a lower limit is also not considered as an acceptable limit for F.  In those cases where there is no analytical assessment yielding values for F, France uses the secondary indicator provided by the Commission Decision (i.e. the catch/biomass ratio). The GES definition for France requires that this indicator remains stable or shows a decreasing trend. This is in line with the current approach, as outlined by the Commission Decision and the 2010 Task Group 3 Report.  However, it should be noted that the Task Group 3 Report states that the secondary indicators that are based on the absence of a degradation gradient are the best possible criterion for GES but fail in achieving true GES when the attribute described has already deteriorated to a more or less stable (degraded) state. 

Criterion 3.2
France has set GES at or above MSY-Btrigger for their SSB with a probability of 50%. Setting the SSB at MSY-Btrigger is in line with current Commission guidance. However the GES definition should be set as a limit rather than a target, therefore the statement regarding a 50% probability is not in accordance with current Commission guidance. In the case where analytical assessments yielding values for SSB are not available France uses the secondary indicator (3.2.2) “biomass indices” and requires that for each stock the indicator remains stable or shows a positive trend. This is in line with current Commission guidance. 

Criterion 3.3
France has repeated textually the text as provided in the Commission Decision and has not specified it further. Indicators 3.3.1 and 3.3.3 have been developed further but do not contain any specific thresholds. Criterion 3.3 requires further development both by France and within the MSFD process in general. France acknowledges the gaps in knowledge in relation to criterion 3.3 and the necessity to keep developing this particular aspect of GES. This is in line with current Commission guidance.";The French GES definition for Descriptor 3 is considered inadequate. For Criterion 3.1 setting Fishing mortality at Fmsy is in line with the Commission Decision but this needs to be set as a limit rather than a target. The application of the secondary indicator catch/biomass ratio follows current Commission guidance. For Criterion 3.2 the use of MSY-Btrigger is in line with the Commission Decision but this will need to be set as a limit rather than a target. The use of the secondary indicator biomass indices has been adequately applied. In the case of Criterion 3.3 it is acknowledged by the Commission that this criterion requires additional work to become operational and therefore the current French application of this criterion is considered adequate.;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators (including secondary indicators) and adequate use of EU standards (Fmsy and MSY-Btrigger)

France (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The assessment of the level of and impacts from the pressure caused by the extraction of fish and shellfish (fisheries) has been done at a similar level of detail and using a similar methodology for all four marine subregions. The assessment of adequacy has therefore been done for the four subregions together.

The French assessment of the level of fisheries pressure for both commercial and recreational fishing has been reported in detail (including quantitative information) for all subregions. Reductions in commercial fleet sizes are given as percentage reductions in fleet sizes from those in the late nineties compared to the current fleet sizes for each region except for the Celtic Sea. In addition, France has provided a partial judgement on the level of the pressure from fisheries, which has been done by reference to Fmsy (and therefore to GES) using ICES estimates. However, it has not concluded on the state of the stocks with respect to GES.

The assessment of impacts provides a general overview of the various impacts by fisheries but lacks quantitative assessments and references to historic baselines. In particular France states that the impact of trawling has not been quantified across the four subregions. In all four subregions, impacts of fisheries on the seabed, fish, marine mammals and turtles have been estimated as moderate although not in relation to GES. 

France has also provided a partial judgement on the impacts of fisheries on fish and shellfish by providing information on the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of relevant stocks for the marine subregions (providing the list of these stocks), referring to ICES estimates. Again, France has not concluded on whether the level of impacts on fish and shellfish is at or below GES. ";The French initial assessment for descriptor 3 is considered adequate.  The French assessment has assessed fishing fleets and the level of fishing pressure including that of recreational fisheries.

France (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);The French targets are not described in detail. The timescale for achievement is given as 2020 but gives no indication whether the objectives of the MSFD will be met. In particular targets 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 to improve the states of the stocks or promoting their recovery towards achieving good status do not specify if these stocks will actually achieve GES by 2020 which is the aim of the MSFD.  ;The set of targets defined by France to cover D3 in the North East Atlantic marine region is considered inadequate. None of the targets address specific stocks, fisheries or contain thresholds that would make the targets actionable and measurable and neither do they match the ambitions of the MSFD (it is not specified for instance that “good condition” is the same as GES).;"- Do not address specific stocks
- Do not contain thresholds or baselines 
- Do not match the ambitions of the MSFD";1;Inadequate
France (North East Atlantic);D3;Consistency ;;"The GES definition for D3 for France still requires some modifications to be in line with the decisions made regarding Descriptor 3 in the context of the MSFD CIS process. However, the GES definition does apply the primary and secondary indicators as provided in the Commission Decision with the exception of indicator 3.3.2. The GES definition is the same for all of the French subregions and therefore consistent across regions. 

With regard to the initial assessment, France does refer to fishing mortality and SSBs for several stocks but does not assess the level of the extraction pressure in relation to the GES definition. The initial assessment has been done in a consistent manner for each marine subregion. The targets as provided by France remain vague and unspecific and do not address the issues identified in the initial assessment. They also do not use the GES indicators and thresholds. The targets for the Atlantic and the Mediterranean are different but suffer from similar issues.

France (North East Atlantic);D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"As for D1, GES is defined at descriptor, criteria and indicator level. There is a good coverage of all criteria and indicators as defined in the Commission Decision but none of the supplementary indicators defined in the Decision are used. France justifies this because the development of these indicators can only be ongoing because it will require further research to understand exactly how food webs respond to each of the pressures and what are the emergent properties resulting from the impact of these pressures. The definition of GES at descriptor level is not a simple reformulation of Annex 1 of the Directive and there is an expanded definition of each of the Commission Decision criteria.

The accompanying document cites the Habitats and Birds Directives, OSPAR’s EcoQOs (but these are not explicitly included in the GES definitions), the Barcelona Convention, ACCOBAMS and ASCOBANS. In terms of the biological elements covered by the definition of D4, France mentions the three biological groups that are covered by D4: plankton (bacterioplankton, phytoplankton and zooplankton), mobile species (small pelagic and demersal fish, cephalopods, top predators and elasmobranchs) and benthos (zoobenthos and phytobenthos). In addition, as for D1, France provides a detailed account in its accompanying document of the criteria that will be used for the selection of the species to be considered (including top predators). In the Ministerial Order, no detail is provided on the species covered by the definition other than those “sampled in scientific missions”. Links to other relevant descriptors are made in the accompanying document.

The text of the definition of D4 is qualitative. Relevant thresholds are to be specified at a later date (as for D1). More information is provided on the Large Fish Indicator (4.2.1), referring to OSPAR’s EcoQO, but France specifies that for the moment this indicator is relevant only for demersal fish and thresholds are set only for the North Sea subregion. It should be noted that France has included a condition related to recycling processes of organic matter for the achievement of GES. This is line with the special focus given by France to contamination by microbial pathogens and should be noted as a good practice as this aspect is neglected in most monitoring and assessment programmes. It is equally relevant to D1.7 as to D4. ";Taking into account that D4 requires unfamiliar assessment approaches, the GES definition for D4 by France is considered to be adequate. There is an adequate coverage of all criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision. There is no direct reference to RSC approaches in the definitions themselves but in the accompanying text. There is in general a lack of quantification of the definitions. Finally, it is understood that indicators for D4 are underdeveloped, but it should be possible to pinpoint some of the key predator-prey relationships within the region/sub-region. There is no clear plan as to how and when additional research would be carried out to further develop these indicators. However, the inclusion of an indicator on the recycling processes of organic matter is considered a good practice.;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators

France (North East Atlantic);D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"France has defined one target and three indicators to cover D4 in the Bay of Biscay and Celtic Seas subregions and four targets for the North Sea. The two sets are different. All targets are very general and to a certain extent a reworking of the GES descriptor for D4.  They are not specific or measurable because of a lack of threshold values and baselines and do not address specific pressures or impacts. No reference to existing international, EU, national and RSC targets is made in the definitions of the targets or in the accompanying text of the paper reports. 

There is very limited mention in the targets of specific measurable components of food webs (only in target D4.1.2 for the North Sea), including specific species/functional groups covered by the targets. Further information is provided in the paper report for the North Sea as to what are the main components of the food web covered by the targets (including concrete examples of these). This is not consistent across all subregions and remains at the example level rather than setting actual indicators. 

In the North Sea definitions, there is a lack of specificity as to what is meant by ‘disruption of primary production” (e.g. meaning over-production in enclosed areas exposed to nutrient enrichment) and which activities might cause this impact.

No key top predators are specifically mentioned, e.g. selected species or groups of fish, mammals, seabirds. There is also no mention of which human activities threaten those. Again, some examples are provided in the North Sea paper report, but it remains at the example level. ";The set of targets and associated indicators defined by France to cover D4 is considered inadequate. As for D1, none of the targets is SMART. All the targets seem to set out objectives of GES, rather than constituting actual targets. Without information as to how these targets will be achieved in practical terms, despite having a timeframe of 2018, it is uncertain that they will be achievable. As for D1, a certain amount of additional information would have been needed in order to set more realistic targets. The targets are not sufficiently ambitious to reduce the pressures or impacts to levels that will achieve GES (if possible by 2020) because they do not directly address pressures and impacts in a specific way. The one target which indirectly relates to impacts (target D4.1.1 in the North Sea) is too vague to be helpful in the quest to achieve GES. ;"- Set out objectives of GES, rather than constituting actual targets
- Not SMART (lack of threshold values and baselines)

France (North East Atlantic);D4;Consistency ;;"Considering that the GES definitions for D1, 4 and 6 are general and address all features, the features assessed in the initial assessment are consistent with the GES definitions for biodiversity. The assessment of pressures, physical loss and damage, is also consistent with the GES definition for D1 and D6. Although there is a lack of consistency in the reporting sheets between what is reported under the physical loss/damage pressures and the inclusion of these pressures as impacting certain habitat types. However, the pressures addressed under the D1 definition are much broader than just physical loss and damage (e.g. fisheries, eutrophication, contaminants, NIS, etc.) These are also covered by the French initial assessment and are assessed in the following sections of the present report. 

With regard to the targets for the Atlantic subregions, these are so general that it can be considered that they cover all the features included in the initial assessment but the link between the conclusions from the initial assessment (e.g. on the bad status of a particular element when it has been assessed) and the targets is not made. For the Mediterranean region, the specificity of the targets indicates a closer link between the IA and the targets defined. Although it is not in the scope of this assessment to verify that each target defined for the Mediterranean finds grounds in the full IA for the Mediterranean (paper report), the consistency check carried out indicates that this is the case. 

There is also a lack of consistency between the extensive but too general GES definitions and the limited and still too general targets. In particular the targets defined for the Atlantic subregions clearly do not cover all aspects of the GES definitions. On the other hand, considering that the GES definitions for all three descriptors are without GES boundaries and baselines, it could have been expected that the targets defined include these elements, in order to introduce some form of specificity.

France (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in both the paper report (Ministerial Order) and the RS. 

All Descriptor 5 criteria laid out in the Commission Decision are incorporated and specific indicators identified. GES (MSFD) is at least comparable to GES (WFD) normative definitions of ecological status for coastal waters. The indicators selected appear to offer full compliance with Descriptor 5 and its associated criteria and indicators. The GES definition is matched to the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal marine waters and thus GES (MSFD) should equate to at least GES (WFD). Furthermore, the accompanying text to the Ministerial Report states that “GES... is based on the use of the WFD methodology... [with]... an extension of this approach seaward”, and provides some details on how the WFD methodology will be adapted to the offshore areas.

However, while references are provided in the Ministerial Order to access details about threshold values and EQR baselines, the information is not included in the GES definition directly. In the accompanying document, it is indicated that the threshold values associated to the indicators are those of the WFD for coastal waters and that for offshore waters, they still need to be defined. It appears that while OSPAR-derived thresholds are not yet used in offshore areas (although they might be in the future), OSPAR’s Common Procedure, meetings of HASEC and the ICG draft advice document on GES D5 seem to provide the basis for the French approach to MSFD eutrophication assessment and management. The approach offers flexibility in its application, depending on data availability and reference conditions. 

In terms of adequacy, the definition of GES is a reformulation of the MSFD, but with one important exception: GES can be achieved if nutrient levels are high, providing direct or indirect impacts are limited. The terms ‘high level’ and ‘limited impacts’ are not clearly defined, although they are directly linked to the definitions at indicator levels (indicator 1 for the nutrient levels and 2 and 3 for the impacts). As mentioned before, there are no clear threshold values for some of these indicators and their establishment is linked to future studies with no specific responsibilities assigned or timeline (except the overall timeline of 2018 for the review of the marine strategy). ";The GES definition for Descriptor 5 by France is considered partially adequate. France went to a lot of details for its definition of GES and seems to be in line with the minimum requirements, although the lack of specification regarding the threshold values to be used in offshore areas is an important gap. It is difficult to fully assess the adequacy of the GES definition, so long as it not clear which approach (WFD, OSPAR or a mix) will be chosen by France for the definition of threshold values. Adopting WFD thresholds and applying them to offshore waters may result in a less ambitious interpretation of the MSFD than that envisaged by OSPAR. In addition, France has left an open door which could prevent reaching GES. ;"- Detailed definition of GES and in line with minimum requirements 
- Lack of specification on approach to be used to set threshold values in offshore areas (WFD/OSPAR)

France (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Data with regard to level of nutrient, phosphorous and organic matter concentrations in the environment is very limited and qualitative at best (Celtic Seas) and even inexistent for the North Sea and Bay of Biscay. No justification is provided by France for this gap. There is more information on inputs, most of it having been collated for WFD purposes, in a very localised fashion. All relevant nutrients and organic matter are included in the assessment. Some of the data (for the Bay of Biscay) dates back to 2004, which means that the conclusions are quite dated. Some river flows are measured, and others are modelled, adding further uncertainty.

Information on marine activities causing the pressure is sparse, qualitative and based on 2004 inventory prepared for the WFD. For the Celtic Seas, the IA highlights that the Island of Ouessant is the only human inhabited area of the subregion and is a minor source of nutrient/organic inputs when compared to inputs from adjacent marine areas. 

The assessment does not cover all impacts (e.g. abundance of perennial phytobenthos or water transparency are not covered), is localized and does not include a quantitative analysis. The IA identifies several areas as either being sensitive or subject to eutrophication. Other impacts such as phytoplankton blooms are covered in WFD assessments and/or in a very localised fashion. In the Bay of Biscay, benthic invertebrate community status is sensibly used as an indicator of benthic impact, in addition to which dissolved oxygen status is also measured. The proportion of the areas and biological features impacted has not been assessed. This is explained by a lack of data but no plan is proposed to address the issue.

Judgements in relation to the definition of GES for the MSFD have not been made on the level and impacts from eutrophication, nor on trends. The RS contains only a descriptive part on the level of impacts (status) without making a conclusive judgement on how it relates to GES (good, not good) and how it evolves (improving, declining, stable). However, in the North Sea and the Celtic Seas, France makes a positive assessment of the level of the impacts of nutrient enrichment on the water column in relation to the Good Ecological Status of the WFD. In general, in the Celtic Seas, France notes that eutrophication is not a major problem. ";The analysis and assessment by France of the level of, and impact from, eutrophication is considered as partially adequate in the light of available knowledge/ level of information/ established methods. Important data gaps are acknowledged by France but no clear plan is proposed to address those. The assessment does not cover all impacts and lacks quantification. In addition, there is no link between the assessment data and MSFD GES but the link is made with the WFD. ;"- Sufficient information reported on levels of pressure and input loads but lack of quantification 
- Limited assessment of impacts
- No judgement in relation to MSFD GES but link to WFD GES

France (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"North Sea and Bay of Biscay
All of these targets are unspecific with regard to impacts, focusing instead on pressure reduction. None of them have threshold values or baselines defined. However, all are measureable. None of the targets appear to be time-bound, except for the general deadline of 2020. The final target (5.2.4) does not specify that the OSPAR objectives should be met, only that there should be a ‘move’ towards reaching them. 

The targets mention different types of pressures, but do not set an overall quantitative threshold for them (with exception of one target, which mentions contribution to the OSPAR objectives but does not state them), nor quantitative targets for individual pressures. 
While the targets cover all areas within the Bay of Biscay and North Sea subregions, regardless of whether they are quasi-pristine or impacted by eutrophication, target 5.2.4 should ensure that those areas which are most heavily impacted should receive the greatest attention in a future programme of measures.

Celtic Seas
A single over-arching target is provided for Descriptor 5. It clearly relates to the initial assessment, which concludes that in the subregion Celtic Seas eutrophication is only a minor problem and that no ecological impact has been observed. Eight indicators have been defined, which correspond to the eight GES indicators included in the GES definition. 

The indicators are specific and measurable, however no threshold values or baselines have been set. The indicators are specific with regard to impacts, but vague with regard to contributing pressures. 

Since land-derived loads of nutrients and organic matter are considered negligible in the Celtic Seas, it seems that the target should also tackle transboundary sources in order to achieve GES. However, these are effectively outside the remit of the Directive. The question therefore arises whether nutrient/organic loading in one MS which has a low/acceptable impact in the sovereign waters of that State but contributes to the failure to achieve GES in an adjacent MS’s marine waters, should be targeted within the contributing country’s programme of measures. ";The targets defined for the Atlantic region are considered inadequate. The set of targets is fully consistent and mirror the criteria and indicators laid down in the Commission Decision. However, the level of ambition of the targets set by France for the North East Atlantic region is low. Since any reduction of loads, no matter how small, would be an achievement of targets 5.2.1 to 5.2.4 (North Sea/Bay of Biscay), they are of course achievable and realistic. The targets and indicators for the Celtic Sea can be considered as realistic if the current assessment of trophic status (i.e. that eutrophication is not a problem in the Celtic Seas) is correct. All of the targets fail to distinguish between individual impacts. Therefore they are not sufficiently targeted towards reducing the levels of the specified pressure or its impacts, or controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved. ;"- Consistent set of targets
- Mirror the Commission Decision criteria and indicators
- Low level of ambition 
- Fail to distinguish between individual impacts. 
- Not geared towards reducing levels of pressure/impacts";1;inadequate
France (North East Atlantic);D5;Consistency ;;"The assessments of the pressure and its impacts in the different subregions of France are not fully consistent with the MS definition of GES. Eight indicators are included in the GES definition to monitor various pressures but not all pressures (loads) have been considered in the IA and there are gaps with regard to impacts covered, estimated transboundary inputs from adjacent marine areas and primary-productivity-derived organic loads within the marine sub-regions themselves. It is clear that much of the information provided is from assessments made prior to the development of GES thresholds for the 8 indicators provided, so its utility for assessing GES achievement is limited.

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators set for the North Sea and Bay of Biscay cover most of the different pressures and impacts related to D5 because they are so vaguely defined and lack any orientation towards individual sources of nutrients or organic matter. However, no target is provided for nutrient or dissolved oxygen levels in the sea, or chlorophyll levels and its contribution to reduced water transparency, but reference is made to the achievement of OSPAR objectives. Any reference to individual impacts/indicators is avoided, except to refer to eutrophication itself as an impact. For the Mediterranean, there is a need to define specific targets for D5 to better cover eutrophication-relevant pressures and increase their specificity with regard to individual sources of nutrients and organic matter. 

It is not possible to know whether the targets will lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts considering the lack of quantification.  It is clear that the targets provide no greater impetus to reducing eutrophication pressures and impacts than pre-existing objectives/targets. As a conclusion, it is unlikely that the targets defined are sufficient to achieve GES considering the lack of numerical values. The targets offer no more protection against marine eutrophication than the current OSPAR objectives. ";;;;
France (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has defined GES for both criteria (although without expanding on the Commission Decision’s wording) and for two indicators. Indicators 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 have been elaborated but none of the indicators for criterion 6.2 have been used. For indicators 6.2.1 through to 6.2.4, France states that they will be developed through further studies. The timeframe provided for the further development of these indicators is the same as for D1 and D4, as per Article 4 of the Ministerial Order. In addition, further information is provided in the accompanying document on the activities planned in the short term (2012-2013) for the further elaboration of the indicators of criterion 6.2. 

The definition of GES itself does not refer to relevant RSC approaches or international agreements but the accompanying text does cite that the approach for D6 in France has been developed within the framework of OSPAR (IGS-COBAM and ICG-MSFD).

In the main GES definition, there is mention of the substrate types the GES definition addresses (apart from a general mention of “engineer species”) but biogenic substrates are mentioned under criterion 6.1. In the accompanying document France refers to the habitats selected for D1 and D4 as those also selected for D6, to be considered in combination with the pressure areas for D6. In the reporting sheet however, France mentions that its GES definition covers “All Seabed Habitats”, which is more in line with the objectives of D6. 

In the GES definition, France uses general terms such as “significant impact”. However, under Criterion 6.1 a quantitative approach to determine the GES boundaries is proposed (% of area occupied by biogenic substrate acted on by pressure physical damage), but without providing an actual numerical limit value. This is justified in the accompanying document by the state of current knowledge, which does not allow yet for the development of limit values. 

The definition at the indicator level does not mention baselines, reference conditions or deviation from some acceptable condition. The main general definition touches on this, stating that the rate and intensity of physical pressures should not exceed “levels presented in Annex 2 of this order” but it is not clear what this refers to as no specific levels for the pressures are presented in Annex 2 of the Order. Finally, it seems that only “physical” pressures are addressed by the GES definition and no mention is made of other types of pressures (e.g. NIS, lack of oxygen from eutrophication, contaminants/oil spills, hydrological changes), which cumulative impacts may affect seafloor habitats.";The GES definition for D6 by France is considered partially adequate. The definition covers all Commission Decision criteria and indicators for criterion 6.1. An attempt is made to quantify criterion 6.1 by proposing an approach to determine GES boundaries but without providing actual values. Indicators for 6.2 are absent and the criterion is only addressed in vague terms. At this stage, more details would have been expected for criterion 6.2. The condition of the benthic community is one of the most studied and well-documented aspects of biodiversity, across most of Europe. For this criterion, WFD indicators should have been mentioned (at least the methods, if not the interpretation scale). This is relevant especially for indicators 6.2.1 (indicator species) and 6.2.2 (multi-metric indices of benthic community structure). These are internationally used for almost any inspections of municipal effluent, aquaculture etc., and have also been applied at a pan-European scale. ;"- Partial coverage of criterion 6.2

France (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Presssures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

For the North Sea and Bay of Biscay subregions, France considers all relevant types of loss and damage that have occurred and provides a quantified description of the extent of the various activities causing the pressures (or the volume of material for physical damage). The only future trend provided is for marine material extraction, which is predicted to follow an upward trend over the coming ten years. France does not provide a quantified assessment of the level of the pressure caused by these activities but provides a qualitative judgement. For physical loss, France considers the pressure as significant and localised on the littoral or the coasts. It is not clear how it has reached that conclusion. For physical damage, France only mentions that sources of damage are present all over the subregions, with different intensities and frequencies (and fisheries occurring throughout the subregions). 

In the reporting sheets, France lists three activities causing physical loss in the North Sea (ports, land claim defence and aquaculture) to which could be added cables/pipelines, dredging and solid waste disposal according to the description made. No activity is reported for the Bay of Biscay but the same as for the North Sea apply to the subregion according to the description of the pressure. For physical damage, no activities is listed in the reporting sheets for either subregions, but according to the descriptions, it is clear that pipelines, dredging, fisheries, extraction of seaweed, mining and tourism (through seagrass beds trampling) are the main activities causing damage in the two subregions. 

With regard to the impacts from physical loss on seabed habitats, France provides a description of the activities responsible for these, the extent of these activities and the type of impact caused (e.g. smothering of habitats) as well as the habitats mostly affected (coastal, estuary and intertidal benthic habitats). It also provides a list of predominant habitat types mostly affected by the pressure, according to the predefined classification. Similarly to the level of the pressure, no quantified assessment is made of the impacts on habitats (i.e. extent of habitats impacted); only a qualitative judgement is provided which considers the impacts on mediolittoral biocenoses to be moderate but it is not clear how France reaches this conclusion. For physical damage, France has identified some of the types of impacts that are occurring (e.g. silting, abrasion, trampling) and the features most impacted (e.g. eelgrass, maerl). As for physical loss, it provides the list of the predefined predominant habitat types mostly affected by physical damage. France makes a qualitative judgement on the level of impact on sub- and circalittoral sediments (high), demersal species, exploited species and phytobenthos (moderate) in the North Sea bathyal and abyssal sediments (moderate) and mediolittoral sediments and infra- and circalittoral hard substrates (low) in the Bay of Biscay. Again, it is not clear how France has reached these various conclusions.

The situation in the Celtic Sea subregion is slightly different from that in the other two subregions as only a limited number of activities occur that are susceptible to cause physical loss or damage. France provides an account of these activities and their extent. It lists land claim defence and cables/pipelines for physical loss but should also include extraction of seaweed and ports according to the description of the pressure. For physical damage, it lists fisheries and extraction of seaweed. Cables/pipelines and research could be added to the list (considering that the Ile d'Ouessant is a focus for marine biodiversity research). France does not make a quantified assessment of the level of impact from physical loss but concludes that the Celtic Sea subregion can be considered free from this pressure. For physical damage, France states that the area is potentially affected by abrasion, but is not conclusive on the current level of the pressure.

Despite the presence (however limited) of physical loss in the subregion, France concludes that no impacts on seabed habitats have occurred. For physical damage, France makes a qualitative judgement on the level of impacts on circalittoral sediments (high) and bathyal and abyssal sediments (moderate). As with the other assessments, it is not clear how France comes to this conclusion. 

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
For all habitats, France has acknowledged that it has not made a comprehensive assessment but provides a description, which contains a very rudimentary assessment. For the Atlantic subregions, only some habitat types have been reported and there is no justification why other habitats, which do occur in the sub-regions, are not included. However France does acknowledge that there are gaps in its assessment, which will be addressed in the next reporting cycle. No assessment is made for special habitats in the reporting sheets although they are referenced in the paper report. In the reporting sheets, France has reported on the following predominant habitats: littoral rock and biogenic reef, littoral sediment, shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shallow sublittoral mixed sediment, shelf sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shelf sublittoral mixed sediment and marine water: shelf. For seabed habitats, it covers most of the main zones (littoral, shallow, shelf) except the deep sea (bathyal/abyssal) zones, and does not address some sediment types. 

France describes the distribution, extent and condition of the habitat types reported in quite some details, including quantitative information (e.g. for the geographical distribution and extent of the habitats) and qualitative trends in the habitats’ condition. The main pressures on each habitat type have been identified. The pressures on habitats in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay subregions include introduction of NIS, introduction of hazardous substances, nutrient enrichment, marine litter, physical disturbance, damage and loss and extraction of species. In the Celtic Sea, only the extraction of species (all) is reported as a pressure on habitat types. 

The status of each habitat’s distribution, extent and condition are not assessed. France justifies this by stating that because of the lack of assessment criteria at the scale of the subregion and because the information collected is fragmented and heterogeneous, it has not been possible to assess the overall status of the habitats. In some cases, France provides a limited assessment of the status of a particular habitat type (e.g. deterioration of coastal limestone habitats in the North Sea region). For shelf waters, France refers to the assessments carried out in the framework of the WFD, although shelf waters would typically occur beyond the scope of the WFD, and provides a qualitative judgement on the status of the waters.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Presssures:
The initial assessment of the pressures of physical loss and physical damage in the Atlantic marine region of France is considered partially adequate. Only a limited amount of information is provided and the only quantification is of the extent of the marine activities causing the pressure. The level of, and impacts from, the pressures are not quantified. A qualitative judgement is made but it is not clear how it France reaches these conclusions. In addition, it should be noted that the consistency check with the paper report shows that similar conclusions have not been found.

Features:
Overall the assessment of biological features by France for the Atlantic marine region is considered partially adequate. For habitats, France has not reported on all relevant habitat types. France describes habitat types in quite some details but does not make a judgement on the status of the habitat types it reports. For species/functional groups, France did not report on all expected/relevant groups although it covers the main groups relatively well. France describes the species/functional groups in quite some details but does not make a judgement on the overall status of the groups. It does however provide an assessment of status for specific species recognized as endangered or threatened according to various EU, RSC and international agreements. However, these ad hoc assessments should be consolidated into a more concise judgement of status. France frequently refers to the in-depth analysis made in its initial assessment paper reports. The consistency check shows that similar type of information is reported in the paper report as in the reporting sheets (but more detailed) and no judgement is made of the status of the species/functional groups. The justification provided by France (limited and fragmented data) should have been complemented by details regarding future plans. Only a general sentence on the review of the assessment of the next reporting cycle is provided by France.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

France (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"France has defined four targets to cover D6 in the Bay of Biscay and Celtic Seas subregions and only two for the North Sea. The targets are general statements and not specific. They are not measurable and have no thresholds, baselines or reference points defined. No reference to existing international, EU, national and RSC targets is made. 

The targets are formulated towards achieving an (undefined) acceptable state and are not specific enough regarding reducing pressures and impacts. Target D6.2.1 (D6.2 in the North Sea) does address impacts but an explanation of the human activities and pressures which cause the impacts is missing (expected are: demersal fisheries, aquaculture, dredging, etc., as appropriate to the MS/SR), as is the plan for mitigation measures. In the paper report for the North Sea, information is provided on the main pressure sources and associated impacts in the subregion and their localisation. 

Targets D6.1 for all three subregions address benthic habitats. While in the North Sea, the target aim to “maintain” benthic habitats (with no explanation of what is meant with maintain, but presumably is related to the text of the GES and the natural conditions), the target for the other two subregions include the notion of “sustainability” (and more specific details on what benthic habitats should be covered in particular). Given that human impacts are inevitable, some quantitative statement on acceptable deviation would be required for both these targets. ";The set of targets and indicators defined by France to cover D6 is considered inadequate for all three subregions. The targets may be achievable, but are too general to be realistic and measurable, within the given timeframe of 2020 (2018 for the North Sea). The targets could be considered ambitious, but none is sufficiently developed to understand the level of ambition or to allow them to be implemented in practice, and therefore they are not currently helpful towards achieving GES. In addition, targets covering the definition of GES for criterion 6.2 should be elaborated, because there is a wealth of knowledge on sea-floor pressures, impacts and indicators. Moreover, there are established remedial measures for best environmental practice of the activities which cause impacts (e.g. demersal fisheries). Finally, the concept of sustainability in Target D6.1 should have been introduced in the GES definition rather than in the target. ;"- Ambitious but not sufficiently developed

France (North East Atlantic);D6;Consistency ;;"Considering that the GES definitions for D1, 4 and 6 are general and address all features, the features assessed in the initial assessment are consistent with the GES definitions for biodiversity. The assessment of pressures, physical loss and damage, is also consistent with the GES definition for D1 and D6. Although there is a lack of consistency in the reporting sheets between what is reported under the physical loss/damage pressures and the inclusion of these pressures as impacting certain habitat types. However, the pressures addressed under the D1 definition are much broader than just physical loss and damage (e.g. fisheries, eutrophication, contaminants, NIS, etc.) These are also covered by the French initial assessment and are assessed in the following sections of the present report. 

With regard to the targets for the Atlantic subregions, these are so general that it can be considered that they cover all the features included in the initial assessment but the link between the conclusions from the initial assessment (e.g. on the bad status of a particular element when it has been assessed) and the targets is not made. For the Mediterranean region, the specificity of the targets indicates a closer link between the IA and the targets defined. Although it is not in the scope of this assessment to verify that each target defined for the Mediterranean finds grounds in the full IA for the Mediterranean (paper report), the consistency check carried out indicates that this is the case. 

There is also a lack of consistency between the extensive but too general GES definitions and the limited and still too general targets. In particular the targets defined for the Atlantic subregions clearly do not cover all aspects of the GES definitions. On the other hand, considering that the GES definitions for all three descriptors are without GES boundaries and baselines, it could have been expected that the targets defined include these elements, in order to introduce some form of specificity. ";;;;
France (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"GES for Descriptor 7 is defined in the reporting sheets only at descriptor and indicator levels, which is explained by the fact that France integrates the criteria defined in the Commission Decision in its general definition at descriptor level. In Annex 2 of the Ministerial Order, the GES definition is specified for Criterion 7.1 and indicators 7.1.1, 7.21 and 7.2.2. The absence of direct reference to Criterion 7.2 in the Ministerial Order is strange and not explained, however, it can be considered that Criterion 7.2 is covered considering the use of the two subsequent indicators. 

The definition of GES is not a simple reformulation of the Directive and it covers the whole scope of D7, being set for both criteria, using the indicators of the Commission Decision. France provides a table, accompanying indicator 7.1.1, which identifies the sources of pressure affecting certain hydrographical conditions. This gives an indication of the parameters to be monitored (albeit without any specific, numerical, details). Clear links are made with other MSFD descriptors (in particular D1, D4 and D6). Finally, the definition is fully aligned with the relevant OSPAR approach as described in the accompanying document and it is consistent with the initial assessment. In the accompanying text, France notes in its accompanying document that D7 should not be assessed with reference to a past status but rather with reference to the current environmental status. This is in line with the Commission approach. Finally, in the accompanying document France refers to the EIA and SEA procedures as tools to monitor hydrographical change, in line with the Commission Decision.  

No information is provided on consistency with the WFD hydro-morphologic objectives (for coastal waters) and no indication is given of the threshold values to be used to monitor progress towards achieving or maintaining GES. In addition, France does not provide a definition of generic terms such as “significant” or “permanent” and acknowledges that it will have to be specified at a later stage. In the absence of numerical values, the indicators do not provide further indication of when GES can be considered achieved. France provides some information on the future plans to address these gaps. Most of the gaps can be related to the low level of work done so far on this rather new descriptor, and to the complex relations between this descriptor and other ones.";The definition of GES is considered adequate in light of current state of knowledge on this rather new topic. The GES definition does cover all the criteria and indicators as in the Commission Decision, it is aligned with the OSPAR and Commission approach and consistent with the initial assessment. However, it does not mention the WFD hydro-morphological objectives for coastal areas, where most pressures/impacts relevant for this descriptor are likely to occur and does not provide a definition of “significant impacts” nor a quantitative threshold values (e.g. of the area affected by change) to monitor achievement of (or maintenance at) GES. ;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators

France (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the reporting sheets, France reports on the level of pressure from changes in thermal, salinity and current regimes for all four subregions. For all parameters, France reports that the pressure is either localised (e.g. changes in thermal regime from power plants in the North Sea) or inexistent (given the current state of knowledge). France also reports a lack of evidence of any impacts on ecosystem components in the four subregions. France reports a lack of studies and long-term reliable monitoring data to justify the gaps in its assessment (e.g. many impacts still not described). In the reporting sheet, France does not provide any information on plans to address these gaps but it does in the paper reports. This justification is consistent with OSPAR assessment of knowledge gaps (an extensive inventory of existing data and knowledge has been done). For the Mediterranean, France has not referred to the State of the Mediterranean Marine and Coastal Environment, which can be explained by the fact that the document was published in 2013. 

All causes are studied and relevant changes are addressed. France has made a judgement on the level of pressure (low) and of impact (no evidence of impacts) however the relationship between the pressure, the change and the impacts is not clearly described. Despite this, the MS has provided a very serious study based on extensive analysis of existing work and knowledge. Most of gaps can be related to the low level of work done so far on this rather new descriptor, and to the complex relations between this descriptor and other ones.";The initial assessment can be considered adequate in the light of available knowledge. It takes into account the work done by OSPAR and for the WFD and gives a good description of the potential pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 7. The link with other descriptors is addressed, the situation for this descriptor in relation to GES is assessed (e.g. some areas – Bay of Seine – are under pressure), gaps in knowledge (pressure/impact relation, turbidity, etc.) are identified and plans to address these gaps are described (with an overall timeline of 2018).;"- Refers to work done for OSPAR and WFD

France (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);The targets proposed are very general and consequently not specific and measurable. They are time-bound (2020), realistic (because very general) and probably achievable considering that no specific threshold is set. No indicator is associated to the targets. The first target is related to an expected final result (GES), rather than to the way to achieve this result (target) (“preservation of functionalities” can be considered a mere rewording of GES definition, as GES is achieved if functionalities are preserved). It is not clear why a third target has been added only to the Bay of Biscay in comparison to the other subregions (basin management would also be relevant for the North Sea, Celtic Sea and Mediterranean subregions). No explanation is provided in the paper reports. ;The targets defined by France for D7 are considered to be inadequate. The initial assessment has concluded that the level of, and impacts from, pressures caused by human activities on hydrological processes are low or non-existent, which implies that France is already at GES. If that is the case, France still needs to set SMART targets in order to maintain GES until 2020 and ensure that current and future activities do not cause a degradation in the current status. The targets set by France for the Atlantic subregions are not SMART and not focused on controlling current or future pressures and impacts. As defined, it is not certain whether the environmental targets/indicators are sufficient to maintain GES. In addition, France has determined in its initial assessment that while the level of pressure can be considered low at the scale of the subregions and region, it can be more intense in certain zones. However, no targets have defined to address these local pressures. ;"- Not SMART
- Not clear if  they are sufficient to maintain GES
- Lack of targets addressing zones identified as under pressure in IA";1;Inadequate
France (North East Atlantic);D7;Consistency ;;"France’s assessment of parameters, pressures (nature, level), impacts (impacted components, level of impact) and relations pressures/impacts is consistent with the definition of GES (level of change, environment components to be considered for GES). 

Considering that France did not produce a consistent set of environmental targets and indicators, they do not cover all the different pressures and impacts identified in the initial assessment and would not guarantee to maintain the current level of pressure and impacts, even less lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts. ";;;;
France (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor level in both the RS and the paper report. In the RS, France justifies the lack of reporting at the level of criteria by stating that the GES is defined in a global way at the level of the descriptor. However, the definition provided does cover the two criteria “concentration of contaminants” and “effects of contaminants”. France has further specified the GES definition at the indicator level in both the RS and the Ministerial Order. 

In the accompanying document to the Ministerial Order, France provides the list of the 85 substances that have been taken into account to define GES. The criteria for the selection of the substances to be measured to determine GES are explained in detail. The list of substances includes: 
1.	WFD Priority substances 
2.	OSPAR priority substances 
3.	PBT substances;
4.	Anti-fouling substances introduced directly into the marine environment, 
5.	Emerging substances: perfluorinated compounds, pharmaceuticals and nanomaterials. 
Two additional criteria are applied to select the substances to be measured to determine GES:
-	Existence of recognised environmental concentrations thresholds; 
-	Existence of a technical guide analysis.

The approach adopted by France for the selection of the contaminants to be measured takes account of the requirements under EU legislation (WFD and EQSD) and under regional conventions (in particular OSPAR but also to a certain extent the Barcelona Convention) and supplements them with additional criteria (e.g. including substances historically followed by the French monitoring networks). The list provided in the Order is comprehensive and covers all priority hazardous substances as defined in EU legislation, regional agreements and additional substances historically monitored in France. It also includes a few substances, known to be of concern in several places in Europe, selected solely for the purpose of the MSFD on the basis of the selection criteria laid out above (BDE 209 (retardant), Methyl_Hg, Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD): aDCBH-, ß-HBCD, ?-HBCD, Tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA-A).  It is not specified which threshold values will be used to measure the concentrations of these substances. Finally, the list in the Order includes any substance accidentally introduced, which has physical effects on biota or biocenosis. 

The GES definition covers the two criteria set in the Commission Decision on the concentration of contaminants and the effects of contaminants. In addition, the indicators to the French definition for D8, as set in Annex 2 of the Order, cover the three indicators laid out in the Commission Decision. 

Concentration of contaminants
The French definition for criterion 8.1 and indicator 8.1.1 sets threshold values for GES to the level of EU standards (EQS) or regional agreements (BAC or EAC) when the EQS don’t exist for certain substances. There is uncertainty as to which standards (EQS or EAC) will be used for the three substances for which an EQS has been set in biota (mercury, HCB and HCBD) as France has not defined a priority order between the EQS and the EAC. It is also unclear what thresholds will be used for those substances selected solely for the purpose of the MSFD and for which no EQS or EAC have been defined. 

One of the indicators of the general GES definition is the concentration of contaminants at top predator level. However France does not specify in the Order or in the accompanying document which predators this might be and which approach would be used to measure the achievement of GES.

Finally, it should be noted that France has chosen to use the OSPAR criteria also in their Mediterranean waters. This is explained by the fact that no common standards/levels have been defined in the Mediterranean region. 

Effects of contaminants
The definition of GES for the effects of contaminants covers the two indicators included in the Commission Decision. France has made an additional effort in defining a list of specific biological effects to be measured, including Imposex, which is the only mandatory effect adopted by OSPAR.  As far as the other effects are concerned, thresholds do exist for some of them but there is no international consensus on these. With regard to the effects caused by acute pollution events, while it is clear that France gives a lot of importance to acute pollution, it has not defined a threshold value to measure the “significance” of the effects from acute pollution. ";The GES definition for D8 is considered adequate. France adequately defines GES for the two criteria and the indicators of the Commission Decision. France provides a comprehensive list of substances covered by the definition. It uses a pragmatic approach using the minimum requirements (EQS) and complementing with the relevant RSC standards but does not provide a priority order between the two approaches for conflicting cases. It should be noted that while OSPAR’s EAC are risk-based (similarly to the EU EQS) and more tailored to marine water assessments than the EQS, the EU requires that the EAC provide an equivalent protection to that theoretically provided by the EQSD. France uses OSPAR’s standards for the Mediterranean but considering that MEDPOL has no criteria of their own, the application of the OSPAR criteria is a reasonable start. However, some assumptions need to be made if the monitored species in the Mediterranean are different from those for which the OSPAR criteria apply.;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criteria and indicators
- Adequate coverage of substances
- Use of EQS complemented with OSPAR standards";3;Adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In all three marine subregions of the North East Atlantic coast of France, the French authorities have reported information on the contamination from synthetic and non-synthetic hazardous substances, radionuclides (except for the Celtic Seas) and acute pollution events. The justification for not reporting on radionuclides in the Celtic Seas, i.e. that the Celtic Seas subregion is far away from sources of contamination by radionuclides and that the environmental concentrations of radionuclides and the impact on man and biota can be considered negligible. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
The level of details of the information reported for the North Sea and Bay of Biscay subregions is similar for synthetic and non-synthetic substances. The contamination levels have been measured in water, biota and sediment for several years through monitoring networks set up in compliance with international and EU legislation. This indicates that the assessment done for the purpose of Art8 MSFD has been using information collected under other processes. 

France is able to provide information (most of the time quantified) on the level of contamination from land-based, sea-based and air-based sources. It does not provide information on the main activities responsible for contamination. The synthetic substances assessed include atrazine and lindane for land-based sources, TBT for sea-based sources and PCBs for air-based sources. For non-synthetic substances, cadmium, mercury, zinc, copper and lead are included in the assessment by France. 

France provides limited information on impacts on functional groups (looking only at the impacts of TBT on imposex) and no information regarding impacts on seabed habitats. In any case, France has only made a judgement on the level of impacts on functional groups and fish and seafood (moderate impact in both regions on marine mammals, birds, demersal and pelagic fish and cephalopods and phytoplankton). Although it did not report any information on impacts on seabed habitats, France made a judgement of moderate impacts on sublittoral rock and sediment habitats in the Bay of Biscay. This seems to indicate that more information has been reported in the paper report than in the RS. It did not make any judgement on the level of concentrations. Despite the fact that there is no information of thresholds and standards used to make the assessment, the reference to international and EU standards seems to indicate compliance with WFD and OSPAR assessment methodologies.

In the Celtic Seas, the assessment of the level of contamination is very limited. It is made on the basis of punctual studies, which conclude that only rare contamination occurs on the coast, rather than long-term monitoring as is the case in the other regions. Almost no quantitative information is provided and very little on the impacts of contamination on ecosystem components. France notes that interactions do take place between hazardous substances and ecosystem components but does not specify which interactions and the level and effects of these interactions. 

Radionuclides
The assessment of the level of and impacts from contamination by hazardous substances in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay has been completed on the basis of the work done in OSPAR. In order to make a judgement on the current level of the pressure in the subregions, France has used the OSPAR objective, aiming to “reduce by 2020 the input, emissions and losses of radioactive substances up to levels in which the additional concentrations are close to zero”, and the OSPAR measures of indicator substances in sea water, algae, molluscs and fish. The results used are relatively dated (2006) and for a number of substances are not significant enough to draw up conclusions on the level of the contamination in the environment. France mentions the low level and decreasing trend of the input from the AREVA site in La Hague but does not provide quantified values. 

The judgement on the level of impacts on functional groups has been done using the methodology developed by the FP7 ERICA project on the assessment of risks and the threshold value of 10 µGy/h, corresponding to lowest level at which impacts can take place on ecosystem components, according to current scientific knowledge. No assessment has been made of impacts on seabed habitats and fish and seafood.

Acute pollution events
The assessment of contamination by acute pollution events has been made in all three subregions on the basis of the number of POLREP (Pollution Reports) prepared for the CEDRE (Centre for Documentation, Research and Experimentation on Accidental Water Pollution). As for the other types of contamination, the Celtic Seas is the subregion least affected by acute pollution. France provides detailed information on the number of incidents, the trends over the past 40 years and the substances discharged in the marine waters. It also provides some information on the impacts on ecosystem components, with quantification of the information only when it comes to the impacts on seabirds (which is in line with the indicator included in the GES definition “number of oiled guillemots”). 

No actual judgement is made in relation to GES. This is explained by the fact that no threshold value is provided in the GES, which makes it difficult to assess whether current status is good or not.  ";The initial assessment made by France in relation to contamination by hazardous substances in the Atlantic marine region is considered partially adequate. The assessment is done using information collected under other processes (France refers to EU and regional standards). While this can be seen as lacking in ambition, it seems to indicate that France has used the methodologies developed under these agreements (including therefore thresholds and baselines but this is not explicitly stated), which can therefore be deemed adequate. France provides a quantitative description of the levels of contaminations but does not make any judgement in relation to GES. The information reported on the impacts from contamination is limited and no judgement is made.  The approach chosen for the assessment of radionuclides in the North East Atlantic (using OSPAR results) should allow for easy comparison with neighbouring countries even though the results are quite dated.  Finally, the justification provided for not reporting on radionuclides in the Celtic Seas is considered only partially adequate since no information is provided on the monitoring confirming these findings.  ;"- Quantitative description of levels of contaminations but no judgement in relation to GES
- Limited assessment on impacts from contamination but no judgement in relation to GES
- Comprehensive assessment for radionuclides";2;Partially adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"France has set one overall target and two subsidiary targets for D8 for the Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay. No detail is provided on the substances used by the targets, the threshold values and the baselines to be used to measure progress. It can be extrapolated that the substances concerned are the same as those covered in the GES definition however it is not explicitly mentioned by France. The setting of target D8.1.2 seems to indicate that France wants more control of the distribution pathways of hazardous substances but it lacks specifics (e.g. how to control biomagnification) The generic targets defined can only be measured in terms of change or rate but the “by how much” element is lacking. 

In addition, the targets defined by France for the Celtic Seas and the Bay of Biscay do not cover all the aspects of D8. France only defined “pressure” targets and has not set any targets targeted at reducing the impacts of contamination on ecosystem components. In addition, France did not define targets related to acute pollution events. 

The targets defined for the North Sea are more numerous than for the other two Atlantic regions and a little more specific in terms of sources of contamination (air-based contamination, contaminants from industrial, urban and agricultural origin). However they are equally deprived of essential elements, such as the substances concerned by the targets, the threshold values and the baselines. The same assumption can be made as for the Celtic Seas and the Bay of Biscay with regard to the substances concerned. 

In the paper report, in the accompanying text to the targets, France mentions the instruments in place for the reduction of contamination from hazardous substances (WFD and OSPAR mainly) and links the MSFD targets to the objectives set out in the relevant French river basin management plan (SDAGE). It also describes the various key elements from the initial assessment concerning the human activities that cause the pressure and the impacts from the pressure, which could indicate that the targets have been set in order to address the issues identified in the initial assessment. However, the links between the initial assessment, the definition of GES and the setting of targets is not made in the definition of the targets themselves or even explained at all in the paper report. ";The targets set by France for the North East Atlantic region are considered inadequate. Although the targets are focused on controlling human activities and reducing pressure, they lack details regarding threshold values and baselines and it is therefore not possible to assess whether they will help to achieve GES. Despite the fact that more information is reported in the paper report for the North Sea subregion than for the other two and the initial assessment is quoted, the link between the issues identified in the initial assessment and the targets set is still not made.;"- Lack of specifics (threshold values, reference points, baselines)
- Cannot assess whether they will help achieve GES
- Poor link between issues identified in the IA and the targets set";1;Inadequate
France (North East Atlantic);D8;Consistency ;;"The assessments of the pressure and its impacts in the different subregions of France are consistent with the MS definition of GES. In its initial assessment, France provides details of land-, sea- and air-based sources where the hazardous substances of concern are a subset of those addressed under GES.

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators set for the Atlantic subregions cover all pressures and impacts identified in the initial assessment of D8 considering their generic nature but would fail to lead to a reduction in the identified pressures and impacts. Considering that France has not reported on the activities causing the pressure, it is consistent (although inadequate) that they have not defined targets for specific activities. In the case of the Mediterranean, the targets are more specific and would lead to a reduction in the identified pressures and impacts if numerical values (thresholds, baselines) were attached to the indicators developed. As a conclusion, it is unlikely that the targets defined are sufficient to achieve GES.";;;;
France (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"France has set GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor, criteria and indicator level in both the RS and the Ministerial Order. 

The definition of GES repeats the Directive and uses guidance of the Commission Decision as far as criterion 9.1 is concerned. For the first part of criterion 9.1 (corresponding to indicator 9.1.1), France includes in its GES definition the threshold values in compliance with existing European legislation, in particular Regulation 1881/2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs. Regulation 1881/2006 is used as a reference for:
-	The list of contaminants addressed in the definition of GES
-	The threshold values (maximum levels) that should not be exceeded  

With regard to the second part of Criterion 9.1, on the annual frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded (indicator 9.1.2), no information is provided in the French Order (Annex 1 or Annex 2) on the threshold value used for this indicator. In the accompanying document, France acknowledges that the threshold for the annual frequency still needs to be determined. It justifies this by mentioning that no consensus on this indicator has been reached across Member States and mentions that the methodology for setting this threshold will be developed at a later stage, on the basis of a hygienic approach to take into account the specificity of D9, which targets human health and not impacts on the marine environment. 

In addition to defining GES for the criterion (and indicators) specified in the Commission Decision, France has defined GES for an additional criterion (9.2) on microbiological contaminants. The EU legislation referred to in the general GES definition is further specified in Annex 2 of the Order and covers all the relevant standards to be applied in this context, including the “hygiene pack”. While the general definition itself is not very specific in terms of the products concerned, a definition of seafood addressed by the definition is provided in the Annex 2 of the Order. France justifies the choice of matrices analysed by stating that these are representative of the consumption of the French population and provides details on the methodology used to make that assumption. 

The links with D8 are mentioned. However, France clearly states that it has not had the opportunity to make a common analysis in the frame of this reporting cycle. No reference is made to the RSCs in the Order but reference is made to the work undertaken in OSPAR in the accompanying document. ";The definition of GES for D9 is considered adequate. France has defined its GES in compliance with the Directive and the Commission Decision (using the same criterion and indicators and the recommended EU standards). Although it has not yet provided the full information that will be used to measure progress towards achieving GES (i.e. lack of threshold value for indicator 9.1.2), it has defined a potentially measurable GES for the number of contaminants and the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded. In addition, France goes one step further than the MSFD/Commission Decision defining GES for criterion 9.2 on contamination by microbial pathogens and using relevant European legislation. This can be considered as a good practice.;"- Adequate coverage of Decision criterion and indicators
- Use of relevant EU standards
- Lack of thresholds for criterion 9.1 
- Inclusion of microbial pathogens in definition of GES (+++)";3;Adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the reporting sheets, the assessment of contamination of fish and seafood is included in the general assessment of contamination by hazardous substances. However, it is important to note that France has also included contamination by microbial pathogens in its assessment of contamination of fish and seafood. This is in line with their definition of GES for criterion 9.2 on microbiological contamination. As for D8, France has not reported in the reporting sheets on the main activities that are responsible for contamination of fish and seafood. 

For all three subregions, France has reported only a limited amount of information on the impacts of synthetic and non-synthetic contaminants on fish and seafood and none on the impacts of contamination from radionuclides. 

For the Celtic Seas, no information has been reported at all on these various impacts and no judgement has been made by France. This is in line with the reporting on D8 for the Celtic Seas which is also very limited, justified by France by an almost inexistent contamination by hazardous substances in the subregion.

In the North Sea, the Bay of Biscay, France has carried out an assessment of impacts only for one synthetic substance (benzo(a)pyrene ) and three non-synthetic (cadmium, lead, mercury). Assessing the levels and impacts of one individual compound such as benzo(a)pyrene is not representative of other similar compounds (e.g. PAHs, metals, PCBs). Individual compounds can behave very differently depending on the medium, species, ambient physical/chemical conditions, etc. While it is limited, the choice of this substance is however in line with the definition of GES. As for non-synthetic substances, certain substances such as dioxins (PCDD/PCDF) and dioxin-like PCBs for which threshold values are set at EU level, are missing from the assessment. 

In its assessment, France has looked whether the levels of contamination have exceeded regulatory levels. In the paper report, France specifies that the regulatory levels are those from Regulation 1886/2008, which is in line with its GES definition. It also further specifies that the data used to make this assessment is from 2000 to 2010 for non-synthetic substances and 2000-2007 for benzo(a)pyrene. This means that the conclusions for benzo(a)pyrene are already quite dated, although this can be explained by the efforts needed for the authorities to proceed to a new baseline survey, and no information is provided by France on their plans for future assessment. 

In terms of judgement, France provides conclusions on the level of the impacts of synthetic and non-synthetic substances on farmed and fished species (North Sea) and on exploited crustaceans and shellfish (Bay of Biscay). While in the RS, it is not specified how France reached these conclusion (e.g. no indication of threshold values used), the paper report provides a little more details explaining this judgement, which seems to have been made on the basis of localized and punctual analyses. In the Bay of Biscay, France acknowledges that the levels of cadmium have regularly exceeded regulatory levels but no information is provided on how this impacts fish and seafood. More generally, the link between the level of contamination by substances and the impacts on fish and seafood is not clearly made. 

Under the initial assessment for D9, France also covered microbial pathogens. 

In the marine sub-region Bay of Biscay, France notes that most of the bathing waters are of good quality under Directive 76/160/EC with only 2% of the waters classified as not in conformity. In the Celtic Seas, all bathing waters are of good quality, while in the North Sea, they are of average quality. However, as underlined by the French report, the coming into force of the more stringent standards set by Directive 2006/7/EC may lead to changes in the classification of bathing waters. In shellfish waters, in the Bay of Biscay and the North Sea, the quality is assessed as medium in the majority of the waters with a trend downwards. In the Celtic Seas, pressure trends and impacts are not assessed as there are no shell fish farms in the area. The report underlines a lack of knowledge on the impacts of microbial pathogens on the marine environment. The main cause for pressures is identified as urban activities (wastewater and rainwater). Judgement on the level of pressure and impact is done for bathing waters in relation to Directive 76/160/EC and for shellfish waters in relation to Directive 2006/113/EC and Regulation 854/2004";The initial assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances (and microbial pathogens) in the Atlantic marine region of France is considered partially adequate. Although there are gaps in the analysis of the impacts from contamination on fish and seafood and no quantitative information provided, France has made a judgement, presumably on the basis of their GES definition and consequently on the basis of EU standards (even though it has done so only for a few substances). ;"- Gaps in the analysis of impacts
- No quantitative information
- Judgement made in relation to GES

France (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"France has defined two targets and four subsidiary targets to cover D9 in the Atlantic marine region. It should be noted that in the paper report (and the reporting sheet for the North Sea subregion), the targets do not include the section “by ensuring that regulatory levels prescribed in EU legislation or other relevant standards are not exceeded”. While we note the lack of consistency, the targets have been assessed on the basis of the complete sentence. 

The two targets are defined at a high level, using generic terms such as “significant risk” and “reduce”, without specification of what is entailed with these terms (i.e. definition of threshold values or baselines). They are however potentially measurable since they refer to “levels prescribed in the EU legislation”, presumably meaning Regulation 1881/2006 for target D9.2 and Directives 76/106/EC and 2006/113/EC for target D9.1.

While the subsidiary targets are focused on controlling human activities and reducing the pressure from anthropogenic sources, no detail is provided on the threshold values and baselines to be used to monitor progress. In addition, there is no specific target regarding the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded.";The targets set by France for the North East Atlantic region are considered partially adequate. The targets are potentially measurable but use generic terms that lack specificity. The subsidiary targets are pressure-based and geared towards reducing inputs from human activities. However they lack the details that would make them measurable and operational (threshold values and baselines). They are not specific enough to assess whether they are sufficiently ambitious to achieve GES by 2020. In addition, it is not clear whether they cover all aspects of the GES definition. ;"- Targets are measurable because include reference to standards
- Subsidiary targets focused on controlling human activities but lack of specifics (threshold values, baselines)
- Do not cover all aspects of GES definition";2;Partially adequate
France (North East Atlantic);D9;Consistency ;;"The assessments of the pressure and its impacts, including contamination from microbial pathogens, in the different subregions of France are consistent with the MS definition of GES. The threshold values used for the assessment of the current levels of contamination are the same as those used in the GES definition. 

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators set for the Atlantic subregions cover the two main types of contamination addressed by D9 (microbiological and chemical contamination). It is not possible to know whether the targets will lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts considering the lack of quantification.

It is also consistent that France has not set targets for the Mediterranean region considering that it has found that levels of contaminants in fish and seafood are “well below” threshold values. However, it would have been adequate to set targets to ensure that good status is maintained until 2020 and that the status is not degraded. ";;;;
Germany (Baltic Sea);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for the biodiversity descriptors at the descriptor level. In the paper report, it has concluded that there is currently no possibility to formulate a GES for biodiversity since there is currently no national or international method which integrates all the individual aspects. 

The German GES definition that has been provided does not apply the structure of the 2010 Commission Decision (criteria and indicators) but rather lists the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Habitats and Birds Directive, the OSPAR Ecological Quality Objectives (EcQOq) and the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). It also refers to other targets for species/species groups under various international conventions such as ASCOBANS in its general definition of GES. The objectives and targets set forth by these pieces of legislation and agreements should be met in order for the Germany waters to be at GES for biodiversity. 

There are however some uncertainties in the phrasing by Germany, for example it is not clear whether all EcoQOs or only specific ones are to be met in order to achieve GES. In regard to targets for species and species groups, ASCOBANS is given as an example of a convention for which the targets should be met; this leaves uncertainty regarding the actual conventions and targets that will be used when assessing the achievement of GES i.e. which convention applies when and for what. Furthermore Germany does not seem to have done a gap-analysis to determine whether these existing mechanisms fully cover the MSFD. As an example, Germany mentions in the accompanying text that the WFD and MSFD overlap in coastal regions but it is unclear how Germany intends to tackle the marine area covered under the MSFD but not by the WFD. Germany does provide in their annexes an overview of how certain aspects of the various pieces of legislation can be used to set indicators and provide thresholds for Descriptor 1 and 4 but does not commit to this analysis stating that these are possible options. Descriptor 6 appears not to be covered either by the GES definition or by the possible indicators included in Annex 2.

Germany does not provide a holistic definition of GES at the ecosystem level. 

In the reporting sheets, Germany provides an extensive list of the pressures and physical/chemical/biological features covered by the GES definition but it is not clear how this specifies further the GES definition as it is stated.  According to Germany’s definition, only listed/protected species are covered by the definition of GES. ";The GES definition covering Descriptors 1,4 and 6 as defined by Germany is considered inadequate. The GES does not go beyond existing pieces of legislation and does not assess whether these are sufficient to achieve the objectives of the MSFD. Germany has also concluded that due to a lack of national and international standards it was impossible to define GES for the biodiversity descriptors. This justification is not considered sufficient to explain why Germany has not provided a GES definition covering all elements of biodiversity (e.g. food webs, seafloor integrity).;"- The definition does not go further than listing existing legislation and agreements
- No holistic definition at the ecosystem level
- All relevant species and habitats are not covered, only listed/protected ones
- Justification that no method exist to define GES for biodiversity is judged as insufficient";1;Inadequate
Germany (Baltic Sea);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Germany has reported on the following species groups: birds, fish and marine mammals. However, the information in the reporting sheets covers only birds. Germany states that are currently no methods developed to analyse and assess functional groups but does not specify how to address these knowledge gaps. In the letter submitted to the Commission in response to the completeness check, Germany mentions that as agreed within the MSFD CIS process, the information on mammals, fish and cephalopods will be submitted through the 2013 reporting under the Habitats Directive. However this suggests that only protected/listed species will be reported on at that time. 

In the reporting sheets seven functional groups of birds are listed but the information is limited. No trends are provided but abundance is sometimes quantified. Germany lists the specific species (coming from ICES and national lists) that are included in these functional groups and indicates that the assignment of specific species to the predefined functional groups is a test and has not been coordinated within the RSC and with neighbouring countries. The main pressures impacting each functional group are also listed.

In relation to fish, the German paper report mentions the relevant lists of endangered species and in some cases reports their status and indicates general trends. Relevant literature is cited and the main pressures listed. In addition, the Habitats Directive, ICES, OSPAR and HELCOM are mentioned. Regarding marine mammals, Germany indicates in the paper report that these are mostly threatened by fishing, pollution and underwater noise but mentions also other sources of pressure such as shipping or oil and gas extraction. Like for fish the relevant conventions and legal instruments are also referred to i.e. the Habitats Directive, OSPAR, HELCOM and ASCOBANS. The conservation status of some specific species is provided (e.g. the harbour seal in the North Sea). 

Habitats
The initial assessment carried out Germany on the habitats in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea covers practically only seabed habitats. Germany acknowledges that while there is good information on areas near the coast there is only little knowledge about other areas. In addition, Germany recognizes that the existing monitoring does not match the requirements of the MSFD and therefore not all assessment areas could be fully monitored for all features and characteristics, indicating that multi-scale spatial models, which consider various pressures and biotope types, can be a good approach for future assessments.

Germany has reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. For both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, the following predominant habitats were listed: Shallow Sublittoral Coarse Sediment, Shallow Sublittoral Sand, Shallow Sublittoral Mud, Shallow Sublittoral Mixed Sediment, Shelf Sublittoral Coarse Sediment, Shelf Sublittoral Mud and Shelf Sublittoral Mixed Sediment. In addition, for the Baltic Sea Germany mentioned Reduced Salinity Water and Variable Salinity (estuarine) Water habitats. For predominant habitats the assessment includes descriptions of habitat distribution, extent and condition are always provided. For some habitat types, the localisation and quantification of extent and distribution, as well as the main pressures affecting each habitat are also covered. However, no trends are or definitive judgements are provided.

Germany has also reported on special habitats. For the North Sea these come from the OSPAR Convention – seagrass beds, macrophytobenthos, mussel beds, seapens and burrowing megafauna, Sabellaria reefs and species-rich coarse sand, gravel and maerl areas. For the Baltic Sea, the following special habitats were reported: seagrass beds, macrophytobenthos, mussel beds, species-rich coarse sand, gravel and maerl areas, offshore deep-water below the halocline, gravel seabed with Ophelia and maerl. In relation to special habitat the assessment covers the description of habitat distribution, extent and condition with a certain level of quantification as well as distribution range and the main pressures affecting each habitat. In addition, the status in relation to natural conditions is provided (altered for most habitats). These judgements were based on experts assessment and WFD orientation and used as baseline the historical stocks and spreads of some species (mussels).

Ecosystems
No assessment has been made of ecosystems. ";The initial assessment by Germany of biological features is considered partially adequate. Not all habitat types and species groups are covered, and there is not enough information on the relevant pressures. In addition, there is no information on ecosystems even if it is likely that some information exists that would have allowed some assessment. Many of the components missing above could be assessed together and thus make a start towards ecosystems assessment. The information reported is mostly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Judgements on status were provided in some cases. Reference is made to existing international conservation agreements and to the Habitats Directive but the justification of reporting under the Habitats Directive timeframe is only relevant for protected/listed species. There is still an important gaps with regard to other species groups. Germany states an ambition to address the knowledge gaps before 2018. This time-frame for supplying information may be too late for the overall aim of GES by 2020.;"Features:

Germany (Baltic Sea);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"
Germany has set one overall target UZ3 on “Seas without damage to marine species or habitats due to impacts from human activities” and four sub-targets for biodiversity which apply to all three biodiversity Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 along, with various associated indicators. 

The sub-targets address ‘no-take’ zones and times, improvements in fishing gear selectivity, protection of migratory pathways of diadromous species, regeneration and restoration of damaged ecosystem components and non-indigenous species (NIS). The sub-target on NIS is assessed under Section 4 on D2. The sub-targets are mostly pressure targets, which is consistent with the general heading of Target UZ3. They do not cover the criteria/indicators of the Commission Decision systematically. They are only specific for a certain pressures (e.g. by-catch) or parameters (e.g. resting areas). They refer to functional groups in the context of foodwebs and migratory species and to protected/listed species but there is no systematic and consistent coverage of all ecosystem components. Habitats are mentioned only through the reference to foodwebs. The targets can be considered to cover partially D1 and D4 but they do not cover D6 on seafloor integrity (apart from the indicator on fishing techniques which could impact the seafloor). 

While the indicators are potentially measurable, they are not further specified through threshold values and baselines, which means that they cannot be used to assess the achievement of the sub-target. Consequently, the sub-targets lack the attributes that would make them SMART (e.g. threshold values and baselines). 

No mention is made of the operational targets/objectives of the various EU/regional/international agreements and mechanisms used to define GES. ";The targets as defined by Germany are considered partially adequate. The targets as a set do not fully address the three biodiversity descriptors and lack attributes that make them SMART, although they are potentially measurable. Since the GES definition relies on existing policies and convention commitments it could have been expected that the targets from these mechanisms would have been referred to under Article 10.  ;"- Cover a number of species and functional groups but mostly listed/protected ones
- Cover D1 and D4 but not really D6
- Potentially measurable but not SMART because no threshold value defined";2;Partially adequate
Germany (Baltic Sea);D1;Consistency ;;"Germany has stated that GES for biodiversity can currently not be defined due to a lack of standards. A GES definition has been provided, which is not structured using the Commission Decision but instead relies on existing legislation and commitments to define the GES for Descriptor 1, 4 and 6. The GES definition is the same for all three biodiversity descriptors but has been adjusted for the North Sea and Baltic sub-region to refer to the correct policy instruments in those regions.  There is no conclusive clarification provided on how these pieces of legislation and commitments cover the MSFD. 

The fact that the initial assessment mentions that existing monitoring does not match the requirements of the MSFD suggests that the German approach likely does not fully cover all the MSFD requirements. Furthermore the targets as provided for in Article 10 do not apply or directly rely on targets from existing pieces of legislation and commitments. There is therefore no consistency in the approach used for setting the GES definition and the targets. In general the biodiversity targets set in Article 10 do not correspond to the GES definition. Overall both the GES definitions and the targets imply a lack of ambition to move beyond existing legislation and commitments. The GES definition and targets also lack clear baselines and thresholds although some are implicit in the legislation and guidelines that are part of the GES definition. ";;;;
Germany (Baltic Sea);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor level. The criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 10 in the 2010 Commission Decision are not incorporated. A similar GES definition is used for both regions – the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The GES definition is based on the definition at descriptor level in the Decision, but further elaboration is not provided. It is also mentioned that marine litter should not support the introduction and spread of non-native species.

The German report mentions the lack of an adequate evaluation system on the environmental effects of waste in the sea. Possible thresholds are given for criterion 10.2 but Germany claims that until adequate evaluation methods of the aspect of GES are found, the definition of Descriptor 10 may be used as a qualitative description of the good environmental status. Germany also notes that even if the sources are identified, the distribution of waste in the sea is highly variable over time and meteorological and hydrodynamic fluctuations.

The two relevant regional instruments (OSPAR and HELCOM) appear to have been taken into account in the respective areas and are referred to in accompanying texts. ";The GES definition of Germany for D10 is considered inadequate. The GES definition is defined only at the descriptor level. Yet, there is no reference to the Commission Decision criteria.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany acknowledges that there is currently very little data on exposure and possible effects of waste in the German Baltic Sea. Germany indicates there are still knowledge gaps in relation to some parameters, namely, micro-plastics or the effect of waste on the degradation of habitats. The need of developing an indicator for the ingestion of marine litter, comparable with the Fulmar in the North Sea, is also mentioned.

Germany has reported on the level of pressure on the coastline, providing the quantification of the amount of litter found and indicating a declining trend. However, no definitive judgement on status is made, even if the results of specific projects are mentioned. The information reported for the water column and seabed is less detailed but the status of the pressure in the water column is still considered not good (for the seabed no judgement is made). On the impact on habitats and functional groups, the information provided by Germany is scarce. 

Reference is made to the HELCOM marine litter project, and also beach litter monitoring. Seabed trawling surveys and aerial surveys also have been done. The approach taken by Germany to assess the current status on the Baltic Sea in relation to marine litter seems to fit the HELCOM approach.";The initial assessment of Germany for marine litter is considered adequate.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined three targets and four associated indicators, under the general heading of Target UZ5 on “Seas without exposure to marine litter” to address Descriptor 10. The targets are more developed in the reporting sheets than in the paper report and are applicable to both marine regions: the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The targets are made measurable through the associated indicators which, for that reason, are analysed below.

The indicator 5.1.1 is intrinsically measurable, assuming it is further specified which materials and categories are measured. However, it is unclear where the waste will be monitored (beach, surface, water column, sea bed). It would be beneficial to further breakdown this indicator and give more detail e.g. on the different areas (floating, water column, sea bed, beach) where the waste materials are collected.

The three other indicators address birds. In relation to the indicator 5.2.1, the methodology and threshold value for Northern Fulmars is measurable and well developed; however, indicators for other species still have to be developed. The indicator 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 address entanglement of birds and are intrinsically measurable. Nonetheless, threshold values are not yet defined and the other indicator species still have to be defined.

All indicators monitor the end-of-pipe impact and are expected not have influence on the pressures/sources of marine litter. All aspects of are MSFD covered and the long term objectives are ambitious. Yet, since no threshold values are set, the actual ambition on the short to medium-term cannot be assessed.

The three indicators on species (5.2.1., 5.3.1, 5.3.2) are based on reported or ongoing work in the initial assessment; the link to the marine compartments (floating, water column, sea bed, and beach) is not clear, but might be covered by indicator 5.1.1. 

All indicators monitor the end-of-pipe impact and have limited link to the pressures/sources of marine litter. Therefore, it is considered that the set of targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 10 is only partly sufficient to achieve GES.";;;;
Germany (Baltic Sea);D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);the GES definition of Germany for D11 is assessed as partially adequate. The GES defined by Germany addresses also other pressures than underwater noise, which can be considered as good practice. However, another approach is used than proposed by the 2010 Commission Decision, i.e. a local EIA-based approach.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany has carried out an initial assessment on the current level of pressure resulting from underwater noise and its impacts for both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The main contributors are clearly identified and there is a lot of accompanying text that refers to scientific background information - this is true both for 11.1.1 and 11.2.1. In any case, Germany acknowledges that there are currently few data on natural and anthropogenic noise pollution in its marine waters and that standardized methods for measuring and analysing the impacts of noise are still missing. 

The information provided by Germany is extensive and mostly qualitative but there is an attempt to quantify some parameters. Both loud, low and mid-frequency impulsive sounds and continuous low frequency sounds are reported but there is no information on the proportion of the area affected by underwater noise. No judgement on the level of pressure is provided (due to lack of available data) but, for loud, low and mid-frequency impulsive sounds a trend is provided – it is considered that the level of pressure is declining in both marine regions. For both regions, shipping, renewable energy structures and the extraction of oil and gas are indicated as the main causes of underwater noise. Mammals and toothed whales are mentioned as the species impacted.";The initial assessment of Germany for underwater noise is assessed as adequate.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined one overall target UZ6 “Seas not affected by human applications of energy” to address Descriptor 11. Germany further reports five sub-targets and possible associated indicators to address Descriptor 11. Two targets refer to respectively impulsive sound and continuous sound, and are thus related to the indicators as defined in the Decision. The concept of Germany deviates from the 2010 Commission Decision. The target for impulsive sound is based on maximal sound exposure at the local scale. It is not directly applicable as a tool for managing pressures on a larger scale.  In addition, targets have been defined for the input of anthropogenic heat, electromagnetic and electric fields and light in the marine environment. An additional target is set to addressing the impact of human activities in marine species and habitats in the section on biodiversity.

None of the targets is time-bound and there is no mention to the achievability of GES by 2020. Threshold values are given for some of the targets but not for all. The targets addressing sound refer to “compliance of already existing or to be established threshold values” but it is not entirely clear what this means. In relation to the targets addressing the other pressures, those directed to the introduction of heat and electromagnetic fields are considered clear and measurable, but the target tackling the introduction of light is, again, rather unspecific and not measurable until some thresholds are defined.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Germany for D11 is assessed as partially adequate.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D11;Consistency ;;Germany presents an approach which deviates from the Decision. The reporting however is consistent. In the GES definition and targets, Germany aims to reduce the impact of noise by human activities to marine life. A different approach is used than proposed in the 2010 Commission Decision. Both in the GES definition and the targets, a local-scale EIA based approach is followed (i.e. exposure threshold). For some aspects, Germany is detailed and threshold values are proposed and already nationally applied – mainly for impulsive noise, while for continuous noise and the impact on marine life, less is known. The others sources of energy are also systematically addressed. Germany addresses also the sources of noise, but it is unclear on how this will be achieved. ;;;;
Germany (Baltic Sea);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The definition of GES for Descriptor 2 applies to both the Baltic Sea and the Greater North Sea sub-regions. It aims at, on the one hand, approaching zero new introductions and, on the other hand, ensuring the absence of impacts from NIS on indigenous species and habitats. The definition is set at descriptor level but relates indirectly to both criteria while remaining very general. 

The accompanying text indicates that Germany relates this definition to the indicator 2.1.1 of the 2010 Commission Decision. It states that ‘good status is reached, if it can be shown that based on the status quo (number of existing non-native species), the introduction of new species have been largely prevented. Therefore, the GES definition as set by Germany does not specifically include the current pressure of NIS and the prevention of spreading or reduction of this already existing pressure. This reflects the fact that the reduction of existing pressure is only possible in a few cases.

The reporting sheet indicates that further development is needed for GES to be operational by 2018. ";The GES definition for D2 is considered as partially adequate. GES is defined in very general terms. It is rather ambitious aiming at zero (or near zero) introduction and prevention of negative impacts from NIS.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany has reported 27 NIS for the Baltic Sea, indicating for each of those the relevant pathway.

Germany states that at present there is no assessment for the condition of NIS, but the evaluation as part of the MSFD should enable future assessments. Germany refers to HELCOM Biopollution-level index but adds that it is not applicable in the present form for the MSFD assessment. Nevertheless, pressure and proportion of impact has been described for some functional groups (mesozooplankton) and some species (Mnemiopsis leidyi). The main vector is identified - shipping. 

Overall, the trend in pressure by NIS is considered as declining in the future and the pressure in the Baltic as low. However, Germany recognises that this judgement is based on random findings from scientific literature and that the information is still sketchy. Germany mentioned that a monitoring programme is being carried out to allow a proper assessment of NIS in the future.";The initial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered adequate for the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. Germany has provided a list of NIS. The main vectors are identified. The assessment of pressure and impact is extremely general and not detailed.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"For both marine sub-regions, the same interim sub-target has been set with three associated indicators. It comes under the overall target UZ3 on ‘Seas without damage to marine species or habitats due to impacts of human activities’, which contains a number of other sub-targets dealt with under the biodiversity section (Section 3).

The first sentence of the target is a simple reproduction of the German GES (approaching zero new introductions). Then, the target calls for implementation of preventive measures and timely recording of new species to support the taking of immediate measures. The last sentence refers in general to development and implementation of regulations and conventions.

The target is not SMART. It is not specific referring to ‘preventive measures’, ‘regulations and conventions’, ‘immediate measures’. The associated indicators suggest what these could be: identification of hotspots, selecting and surveying representative ports and aquaculture areas, implementation of the IMO Convention on ballast water . The indicators also imply a risk-based approach. However, the target remains so general that it is not measurable. It is difficult to achieve and not bound by any timeframe.

The target is ambitious as regard the monitoring of new species (recording) and covers the right mix of preventive and immediate measures linked to monitoring. Since the target is very generally formulated it covers all main sources of new introductions. However, these vectors/pathways have not been specifically addressed. Only marine litter is specifically addressed as Germany has also indicated that the target addressing D10 will also contribute to tackling some of the pressures reported under D2, namely transport of NIS through marine litter. This target is analysed in section 10.";The environmental target is considered as inadequate. The target is very general and effectively expresses what is GES and should more appropriately have been reported against Article 9, but lack any focus on reducing pressures and impacts in order to achieve GES.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for Descriptor 3 at the descriptor and criteria levels in the paper report and at the descriptor and indicator levels in the reporting sheets. The definitions are the same for both the Baltic and North Sea. 

Germany has applied all three criteria 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 as well as all the indicators from the 2010 Commission Decision. The threshold value set for indicator 3.1.1 is that all stocks need to be exploited below Fmsy, this is in line with the Commission Decision. For indicator 3.1.2 the threshold has been set at BMSY-trigger or if this is not available SSBpa if it is known for all stocks. This is in line with requirement of the descriptor text as provided in Annex I of the MSFD that all stocks need to be within safe biological limits. For the secondary indicators 3.1.2 and 3.2.2 as well as the indicators for criteria 3.3 thresholds still need to be set, based on knowledge that is currently being developed. 

The thresholds for criteria 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 will be set using ICES advice and are in line with the latest guidance from the Commission.  ";The German GES is considered adequate. The German GES definition has applied all 3 criteria and all indicators from the Commission Decision. The German GES definition requires that the F for all stocks should be below Fmsy which is in line with the Commission Decision. In regard to criteria 3.2.1 all stocks need to be above BMSY-trigger or SSBpa which is in line with the descriptor text in Annex I of the MSFD which requires all stocks to be within safe biological limits. The lack of thresholds for the secondary indicators and indicators for criteria 3.3 is acceptable considering that there is not yet clear guidance on what thresholds should be applied for these indicators. ;"- All stocks should be exploited below Fmsy

Germany (Baltic Sea);D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany reports to a similar level of details for the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions, using the same methodology to make an assessment of the fisheries pressure. The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions.

The German initial assessment is very general and succinct with very general descriptions of fishing activities and some information on specific fish stocks from ICES. In the German assessment it is mentioned for the North Sea that ICES has assessed five species as being in good condition (herring, sandeel, haddock, plaice and pout), one species as moderate (sole) and two species as bad (cod and pollock). No ICES catch recommendations were available for six species. 

In the Baltic, three species are assessed as being exploited above Fmsy (Cod, Herring, Sprat), other stocks were not assessed in respect to Fmsy. The SSB for Cod was assessed as above BMSY-trigger, herring below and for Sprat it was not known. Baltic stocks of flatfish are however described as being generally stable or increasing. ";The initial assessment of Germany is considered partially adequate. The initial assessment is very general and contains only specific data for certain stocks assessed by ICES. The description of fisheries activities is very general and lacks relevant details. ;"- Very general information on fisheries

Germany (Baltic Sea);D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has set one interim target, UZ4, and four separate sub-targets to deal with fisheries, along with 11 associated indicators. The target should be achieved by 2020. Germany has also indicated that targets addressing biodiversity, contaminants and energy will also contribute to tackling some of the pressures reported under D3, however these targets are analysed in the relevant sections.

While the targets cover all three of the Commission Decision criteria, they are not very specific. Stating that all stocks are managed according to MSY principles does not necessarily mean that all stocks will have a SSB that is above BMSY-tripper or SSBpa although it should mean that all stocks will be exploited at Fmsy. It is also interesting to note that associated indicators have been included for fishing mortality but not for the reproductive capacity (SSB, biomass indices). 

Sub-target 2 of target UZ4 deals with age and size structure and mentions all age classes should be included and continue to move towards natural conditions, this however is not sufficient to guarantee that the reproductive capacity of stocks is within safe biological limits. This second condition would be stronger if it was not just mentioned that all age and size classes should be present but also the proportions of the various age classes or a mention that there should be a high or sufficiently high proportion of old, large individuals. 

Sub-target 3 of target UZ4 takes the effects of fisheries into account on the ecosystem but it is more relevant for descriptor D1 and D6. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Germany for Descriptor 3 is assessed as inadequate. The targets are not sufficiently specific and it is highly uncertain that they are sufficient to achieve GES by 2020.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"From Descriptor 1 assessment (Inadequate; 1):
Germany has defined GES for the biodiversity descriptors at the descriptor level. In the paper report, it has concluded that there is currently no possibility to formulate a GES for biodiversity since there is currently no national or international method which integrates all the individual aspects. 

The German GES definition that has been provided does not apply the structure of the 2010 Commission Decision (criteria and indicators) but rather lists the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Habitats and Birds Directive, the OSPAR Ecological Quality Objectives (EcQOq) and the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). It also refers to other targets for species/species groups under various international conventions such as ASCOBANS in its general definition of GES. The objectives and targets set forth by these pieces of legislation and agreements should be met in order for the Germany waters to be at GES for biodiversity. 

There are however some uncertainties in the phrasing by Germany, for example it is not clear whether all EcoQOs or only specific ones are to be met in order to achieve GES. In regard to targets for species and species groups, ASCOBANS is given as an example of a convention for which the targets should be met; this leaves uncertainty regarding the actual conventions and targets that will be used when assessing the achievement of GES i.e. which convention applies when and for what. Furthermore Germany does not seem to have done a gap-analysis to determine whether these existing mechanisms fully cover the MSFD. As an example, Germany mentions in the accompanying text that the WFD and MSFD overlap in coastal regions but it is unclear how Germany intends to tackle the marine area covered under the MSFD but not by the WFD. Germany does provide in their annexes an overview of how certain aspects of the various pieces of legislation can be used to set indicators and provide thresholds for Descriptor 1 and 4 but does not commit to this analysis stating that these are possible options. Descriptor 6 appears not to be covered either by the GES definition or by the possible indicators included in Annex 2.

Germany does not provide a holistic definition of GES at the ecosystem level. 

In the reporting sheets, Germany provides an extensive list of the pressures and physical/chemical/biological features covered by the GES definition but it is not clear how this specifies further the GES definition as it is stated.  According to Germany’s definition, only listed/protected species are covered by the definition of GES. ";"From Descriptor 1 assessment (Inadequate; 1):

The GES definition covering Descriptors 1,4 and 6 as defined by Germany is considered inadequate. The GES does not go beyond existing pieces of legislation and does not assess whether these are sufficient to achieve the objectives of the MSFD. Germany has also concluded that due to a lack of national and international standards it was impossible to define GES for the biodiversity descriptors. This justification is not considered sufficient to explain why Germany has not provided a GES definition covering all elements of biodiversity (e.g. food webs, seafloor integrity).";"- No specific definition for D4

From Descriptor 1 assessment:

Germany has set one overall target UZ3 on “Seas without damage to marine species or habitats due to impacts from human activities” and four sub-targets for biodiversity which apply to all three biodiversity Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 along, with various associated indicators. 

The sub-targets address ‘no-take’ zones and times, improvements in fishing gear selectivity, protection of migratory pathways of diadromous species, regeneration and restoration of damaged ecosystem components and non-indigenous species (NIS). The sub-target on NIS is assessed under Section 4 on D2. The sub-targets are mostly pressure targets, which is consistent with the general heading of Target UZ3. They do not cover the criteria/indicators of the Commission Decision systematically. They are only specific for a certain pressures (e.g. by-catch) or parameters (e.g. resting areas). They refer to functional groups in the context of foodwebs and migratory species and to protected/listed species but there is no systematic and consistent coverage of all ecosystem components. Habitats are mentioned only through the reference to foodwebs. The targets can be considered to cover partially D1 and D4 but they do not cover D6 on seafloor integrity (apart from the indicator on fishing techniques which could impact the seafloor). 

While the indicators are potentially measurable, they are not further specified through threshold values and baselines, which means that they cannot be used to assess the achievement of the sub-target. Consequently, the sub-targets lack the attributes that would make them SMART (e.g. threshold values and baselines). 

No mention is made of the operational targets/objectives of the various EU/regional/international agreements and mechanisms used to define GES. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The targets as defined by Germany are considered partially adequate. The targets as a set do not fully address the three biodiversity descriptors and lack attributes that make them SMART, although they are potentially measurable. Since the GES definition relies on existing policies and convention commitments it could have been expected that the targets from these mechanisms would have been referred to under Article 10.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D4;Consistency ;;"Germany has stated that GES for biodiversity can currently not be defined due to a lack of standards. A GES definition has been provided, which is not structured using the Commission Decision but instead relies on existing legislation and commitments to define the GES for Descriptor 1, 4 and 6. The GES definition is the same for all three biodiversity descriptors but has been adjusted for the North Sea and Baltic sub-region to refer to the correct policy instruments in those regions.  There is no conclusive clarification provided on how these pieces of legislation and commitments cover the MSFD. 

The fact that the initial assessment mentions that existing monitoring does not match the requirements of the MSFD suggests that the German approach likely does not fully cover all the MSFD requirements. Furthermore the targets as provided for in Article 10 do not apply or directly rely on targets from existing pieces of legislation and commitments. There is therefore no consistency in the approach used for setting the GES definition and the targets. In general the biodiversity targets set in Article 10 do not correspond to the GES definition. Overall both the GES definitions and the targets imply a lack of ambition to move beyond existing legislation and commitments. The GES definition and targets also lack clear baselines and thresholds although some are implicit in the legislation and guidelines that are part of the GES definition. ";;;;
Germany (Baltic Sea);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in the reporting sheets, but only at descriptor level in the paper report. All criteria and indicator laid out for Descriptor 5 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated in the GES definition in the reporting sheets. Germany uses a different definition of GES for D5 for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in order to take into account the relevant guidelines of the applicable Regional Sea Conventions.

GES is defined, but while quantitative reference conditions are referred to, with percentage deviation(s) from these providing thresholds, quantitative values are not provided. However, a clear distinction is made between WFD coastal waters, where WFD normatives will apply for MSFD reporting purposes (perhaps with disaggregation of some WFD indicators), and offshore waters where HELCOM HEAT indicators (currently being upgraded to be fully MSFD-compliant) will apply. GES is achieved, when the “good ecological status” according to the WFD is achieved, and when the eutrophication status according to the HELCOM eutrophication assessment HEAT is at least good. 

GES is defined for nutrient concentrations (5.1.1) under the WFD normative thresholds for coastal waters and for offshore waters under HELCOM HEAT (currently under revision). Reference conditions are referred to, but quantitative thresholds are not provided. However, nutrient ratios (5.1.2) are not considered and no justification is provided. In terms of direct effects of nutrient enrichment, chlorophyll concentrations (5.2.1) are considered according to the WFD normative standards for coastal waters (the WFD uses rather complex indices e.g. for the assessment of phytoplankton, including chlorophyll-a, biovolume, and taxonomic considerations [Cyanophycea and Cryptophycea]) and HEAT standards for offshore waters. These baseline standards, with a 50% deviation to provide thresholds, are referred to but not provided. HELCOM water transparency (5.2.2) reference conditions (Secchi depth) were provided from EUTRO PRO, with a 25% deviation to provide thresholds. The suggestion is that such values are to be incorporated within the revision of HEAT for offshore waters. WFD type-specific reference conditions/thresholds are available and will be used for coastal waters. The situation with regard to abundance of opportunistic algae (5.2.3) is poorly explained but WFD normatives may exist for coastal waters. However, the indicator may not be relevant for offshore waters. Species shifts in floristic composition (5.2.4) are not considered, since an indicator is not available under either the WFD or HELCOM. No justification is provided for not developing such an indicator independently. For indirect effects of nutrient enrichment, macrophytobenthos indices are used for coastal waters (5.3.1), but the relevance of these remains to be tested for offshore waters. Dissolved oxygen levels (5.3.2) are not currently included in HELCOM HEAT for offshore waters (but HEAT is being further developed to allow this) and a macroinvertebrate index is - providing a justifiable surrogate, this is considered acceptable. For coastal waters, dissolved oxygen is measured as a WFD supporting parameter, but no threshold values are provided.

The existing HELCOM HEAT approach to GES definition for D5 was not fully compliant for MSFD reporting purposes, but the updating/revision of HEAT should enable this to be used for MSFD reporting of offshore Baltic waters, providing indicators for nutrient ratios and species shifts in floristic composition are considered relevant and, if so, are incorporated. ";The GES definition of Germany for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. While the existing HELCOM HEAT and WFD indicators do not match fully with MSFD reporting requirements/, shortcomings in existing methodologies and indicators are noted and existing tools/methods are being adapted to enable full compliance in the future. However, the explanations offered with regard to some indicators (e.g. changes in floristic composition) are too vague to make a full assessment and quantitative thresholds for all criteria are not reported, only referred to. For coastal waters some of these WFD thresholds may change as a result of WFD intercalibration exercises, and quantitative thresholds for others are still to be developed as part of the HEAT upgrade.;"- GES definition encompasses all the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision

Germany (Baltic Sea);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"For the Baltic Sea, Germany reports that nitrogen and phosphorus loads have fallen substantially since the mid-1980s, largely due to improved wastewater treatment processes and the use of P-free detergents. These are huge reductions: by half for nitrogen and by three-quarters for phosphorus. Agriculture, forestry, urban discharges and shipping are indicated as the current main causes of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. An assessment has also been made of the major (if not all) impacts of eutrophication, largely from available literature, as opposed to complex modelling studies, with known (high) levels of uncertainty. Impacts on nutrient and dissolved oxygen concentrations, as well as phytoplankton community composition and water transparency and the impacts of these on benthic communities are discussed.

While no trend analysis has been undertaken to determine whether the situation is improving or worsening in the Baltic Sea, the huge reductions in nutrient pressures would suggest that if improvements in impacts have not begun to occur yet, they will in the future (a delay between pressure reduction and impact reduction is to be expected). No current assessment of status has been made (but for nutrient and organic matter enrichment overall), but based on the information presented it appears that in some areas at least, GES would not be achieved.

As for the North Sea, it is indicated that in the Baltic Sea between 75-100% of the water column and seabed habitats are impacted by eutrophication. It is not clear however how Germany has reached that conclusion. ";The initial assessment of Germany for eutrophication in the Baltic Sea is assessed as partially adequate with some reservations. The assessment is both qualitative and quantitative but covers only nutrients, not organic matter. Major impacts have been assessed even though no trends or status assessment has been reported. The pressures and impacts appear to have been determined primarily by modelling, rather than monitoring. Considering that environmental modelling requires monitoring data for both calibration and validation, some monitoring data should be available (e.g. on levels of organic loads and enrichment of marine waters from routine BOD, COD or on dissolved oxygen levels (as required under the MSFD)).;"- Partial assessment covering pressures and impacts
- Covers all relevant nutrients but not organic matter

- Hardly any conclusive judgements on current status";2;Partially adequate
Germany (Baltic Sea);D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined one overall target, UZ1, three sub-targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 5 both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report. The targets are the same for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea except for the reference to the RSCs. 

The sub-targets reported are in line with existing OSPAR/HELCOM and WFD objectives for nutrient reduction. These objectives however are unspecific with regard to individual pressures (e.g. point vs. diffuse source-derived emissions into rivers, or industrial or terrestrial vs. marine transport-derived atmospheric NOx emissions), enabling individual countries to identify the most cost-effective means of achieving nutrient load reduction. The sub-targets are measurable, but are qualitative (except the reference to reduction targets for river nutrient load reduction under the WFD in the first sub-target but these are not fully re-stated in the targets). With regard to the second sub-target, the pressure reduction implies the cooperation with and the involvement of other countries, which is referred to in the second part of the target (This should be done in the framework of regional cooperation under OSPAR/HELCOM). 

The qualitative nature of the targets means that they are all achievable and realistic. The indicators for second and third sub-targets are sufficiently specific. However the indicator for the first target is not considered sufficiently specific. While the targets are all pressure- rather than impact-specific, the proposed indicator for the first target is an impact metric. The targets tackle three individual pressures, but those pressures contain various sub-pressures, which are not considered. The targets are consistent in the sense that they all pressure targets, and therefore do not contradict or conflict with each other.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Germany for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The targets are in line with the objectives of GES and are potentially measurable, achievable and realistic, but also merely qualitative and therefore unambitious. All targets address pressures rather than impacts and do not offer greater protection than the existing normatives under WFD and OSPAR/HELCOM. It also remains to be seen whether the nutrient reduction requirements set out in WFD RBMPS are sufficient to achieve GES with regard to eutrophication. The lack of other impact metrics (particularly direct and indirect impacts) means that it is uncertain whether the targets are sufficient to achieve GES.  As per the mention of Germany, the timelines of the WFD and the MSFD differ and therefore it is uncertain whether applying the WFD will ensure achievement of MSFD GES by 2020.;"- All targets are pressure-based
- Potentially measurable, achievable and realistic
- Lack of thresholds
- Not clear whether  they are sufficient for achieving GES";2;Partially adequate
Germany (Baltic Sea);D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of eutrophication and its impacts is consistent with Germany’s definition of GES for both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. 

In the case of the North Sea, MSFD GES is defined in terms of achieving WFD GES in coastal waters and achieving compliance with OSPAR objectives in offshore waters. With regards to the Baltic Sea, GES is defined in terms of achieving existing WFD and HELCOM objectives. For both regions, while the selected WFD normative definitions are aimed at pressure reduction, the overall WFD objective is impact reduction and/or maintenance (as with the MSFD). Relatively little reference is made to made to trophic status improvement (in its broad sense) and MSFD GES for some D5 thresholds have still to be quantified. This is a cause of concern, since the overall MSFD objective (to achieve GES) is still a “moving target.”

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 does not cover all the different pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 5 identified in the initial assessment. It is unclear which different sources of land-derived nutrients are to be targeted within a programme of measures to reduce river nutrient loads; and, likewise, which contributing atmospheric emission sources are to be targeted. Only a single impact is covered by the target-specific indicators (nutrient concentrations at the limnic-marine boundary), and this is considered to be an inappropriate indicator for the target (nutrient loads via rivers to be further reduced). In addition, only the first target is likely to result in substantial pressure reduction, providing the WFD RBMP guidance is followed. The remaining two pressure reduction targets are effectively open-ended and not time-bound, essentially relying on peer pressure rather than legislation to achieve their aims.

Finally, the set of targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 is probably not sufficient to achieve GES. The second and third targets at first appear to be ambitious, and to some extent outside of the MSFD remit since they tackle transboundary inputs, but the qualitative nature of these greatly reduces their likely effectiveness. The first target has the greatest degree of certainty over its achievability, but whether the load reduction is sufficient to achieve GES in either coastal or offshore waters is far from certain. The extent of internal nutrient loading (sediment-water fluxes) from historically elevated nutrient pressures and the contribution of land-derived organic loading to marine hypoxic events remain to be assessed.";;;;
Germany (Baltic Sea);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Inadequate; 1):

Germany has defined GES for the biodiversity descriptors at the descriptor level. In the paper report, it has concluded that there is currently no possibility to formulate a GES for biodiversity since there is currently no national or international method which integrates all the individual aspects. 

The German GES definition that has been provided does not apply the structure of the 2010 Commission Decision (criteria and indicators) but rather lists the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Habitats and Birds Directive, the OSPAR Ecological Quality Objectives (EcQOq) and the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). It also refers to other targets for species/species groups under various international conventions such as ASCOBANS in its general definition of GES. The objectives and targets set forth by these pieces of legislation and agreements should be met in order for the Germany waters to be at GES for biodiversity. 

There are however some uncertainties in the phrasing by Germany, for example it is not clear whether all EcoQOs or only specific ones are to be met in order to achieve GES. In regard to targets for species and species groups, ASCOBANS is given as an example of a convention for which the targets should be met; this leaves uncertainty regarding the actual conventions and targets that will be used when assessing the achievement of GES i.e. which convention applies when and for what. Furthermore Germany does not seem to have done a gap-analysis to determine whether these existing mechanisms fully cover the MSFD. As an example, Germany mentions in the accompanying text that the WFD and MSFD overlap in coastal regions but it is unclear how Germany intends to tackle the marine area covered under the MSFD but not by the WFD. Germany does provide in their annexes an overview of how certain aspects of the various pieces of legislation can be used to set indicators and provide thresholds for Descriptor 1 and 4 but does not commit to this analysis stating that these are possible options. Descriptor 6 appears not to be covered either by the GES definition or by the possible indicators included in Annex 2.

Germany does not provide a holistic definition of GES at the ecosystem level. 

In the reporting sheets, Germany provides an extensive list of the pressures and physical/chemical/biological features covered by the GES definition but it is not clear how this specifies further the GES definition as it is stated.  According to Germany’s definition, only listed/protected species are covered by the definition of GES. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The GES definition covering Descriptors 1,4 and 6 as defined by Germany is considered inadequate. The GES does not go beyond existing pieces of legislation and does not assess whether these are sufficient to achieve the objectives of the MSFD. Germany has also concluded that due to a lack of national and international standards it was impossible to define GES for the biodiversity descriptors. This justification is not considered sufficient to explain why Germany has not provided a GES definition covering all elements of biodiversity (e.g. food webs, seafloor integrity).";"- No specific definition for D6
– Germany mentions that D6 is covered by the D1 definition

From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

- No holistic definition at the ecosystem level

Germany (Baltic Sea);D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

Germany has carried out an initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage for both the North Sea and in the Baltic Sea (however it should be noted that the assessments on physical damage are only reported in the paper report). Germany acknowledges the need to collect more information concerning sediment dispersal and marine sublittoral habitat types, as well as a more general need for ecosystem models for impact assessment but it does not state any plans for acquiring this information, or carrying out the required assessment of current status (and directions of change – ongoing and/or to desired state).

Explanations of the main causes of physical loss in the area are described, and a quantification of the numbers of relevant structures and spatial extent of impacts are given. Germany lists solid waste disposal and offshore structures as the main causes of physical loss. In relation to shipment of dredged material, it is reported that there is currently no sediment extraction in the German EEZ both in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. For the coastal areas and territorial sea, figures are given for the North Sea (2002-2007) and the Baltic Sea (1999-2009). The main structures are also listed. In the North Sea these include wind turbines, natural gas production, oil production, measuring stations and substations, converters and compression platforms. In relation to the Baltic Sea tourism infrastructure projects and wind farms are mentioned. The main features impacted by physical loss are listed. No trends or conclusive judgements on the level of pressure or its impacts in relation to GES have been reported, as Germany indicates that the data are insufficient and that recognized methods are still missing to do so (although GES is defined by Germany for seabed habitats protected/listed under international agreements).

In relation to physical damage, in the reporting sheets Germany only listed the main causes of pressure - fisheries and sand and gravel mining – and the main features impacted. In the paper report, trawling fisheries are referred to as the main cause of abrasion of the seabed, while the different types of selective extraction of materials (sand, gravel, stone, oil and gas) is related to changes in siltation. The impacts of physical damage are briefly referred to as are some specific projects causing the pressure. There is an attempt to quantify some parameters and a worthy amount of literature is cited. No trends or conclusive judgements on the level of pressure or its impacts have been reported.

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
The initial assessment carried out Germany on the habitats in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea covers practically only seabed habitats. Germany acknowledges that while there is good information on areas near the coast there is only little knowledge about other areas. In addition, Germany recognizes that the existing monitoring does not match the requirements of the MSFD and therefore not all assessment areas could be fully monitored for all features and characteristics, indicating that multi-scale spatial models, which consider various pressures and biotope types, can be a good approach for future assessments.

Germany has reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. For both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, the following predominant habitats were listed: Shallow Sublittoral Coarse Sediment, Shallow Sublittoral Sand, Shallow Sublittoral Mud, Shallow Sublittoral Mixed Sediment, Shelf Sublittoral Coarse Sediment, Shelf Sublittoral Mud and Shelf Sublittoral Mixed Sediment. In addition, for the Baltic Sea Germany mentioned Reduced Salinity Water and Variable Salinity (estuarine) Water habitats. For predominant habitats the assessment includes descriptions of habitat distribution, extent and condition are always provided. For some habitat types, the localisation and quantification of extent and distribution, as well as the main pressures affecting each habitat are also covered. However, no trends are or definitive judgements are provided.

Germany has also reported on special habitats. For the North Sea these come from the OSPAR Convention – seagrass beds, macrophytobenthos, mussel beds, seapens and burrowing megafauna, Sabellaria reefs and species-rich coarse sand, gravel and maerl areas. For the Baltic Sea, the following special habitats were reported: seagrass beds, macrophytobenthos, mussel beds, species-rich coarse sand, gravel and maerl areas, offshore deep-water below the halocline, gravel seabed with Ophelia and maerl. In relation to special habitat the assessment covers the description of habitat distribution, extent and condition with a certain level of quantification as well as distribution range and the main pressures affecting each habitat. In addition, the status in relation to natural conditions is provided (altered for most habitats). These judgements were based on experts assessment and WFD orientation and used as baseline the historical stocks and spreads of some species (mussels).";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures:
The initial assessment by Germany of physical loss and damage is considered partially adequate. The different types and causes of physical loss and damage are well documented and reported. However, the information on impacts is less comprehensive – the habitats impacted are listed but there is no mention to what they are subject to. In addition, there are no judgements on the current status or any information on the plans to gather data that will allow making these judgements in the future. Germany could have placed the pressures in context along the coastline, and possibly also pointed out if there are pressure-free areas (MPAs etc.).

Features:
The initial assessment by Germany of biological features is considered partially adequate. Not all habitat types and species groups are covered, and there is not enough information on the relevant pressures. In addition, there is no information on ecosystems even if it is likely that some information exists that would have allowed some assessment. Many of the components missing above could be assessed together and thus make a start towards ecosystems assessment. The information reported is mostly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Judgements on status were provided in some cases. Reference is made to existing international conservation agreements and to the Habitats Directive but the justification of reporting under the Habitats Directive timeframe is only relevant for protected/listed species. There is still an important gaps with regard to other species groups. Germany states an ambition to address the knowledge gaps before 2018.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4 ,6 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Germany has set one overall target UZ3 on “Seas without damage to marine species or habitats due to impacts from human activities” and four sub-targets for biodiversity which apply to all three biodiversity Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 along, with various associated indicators. 

The sub-targets address ‘no-take’ zones and times, improvements in fishing gear selectivity, protection of migratory pathways of diadromous species, regeneration and restoration of damaged ecosystem components and non-indigenous species (NIS). The sub-target on NIS is assessed under Section 4 on D2. The sub-targets are mostly pressure targets, which is consistent with the general heading of Target UZ3. They do not cover the criteria/indicators of the Commission Decision systematically. They are only specific for a certain pressures (e.g. by-catch) or parameters (e.g. resting areas). They refer to functional groups in the context of foodwebs and migratory species and to protected/listed species but there is no systematic and consistent coverage of all ecosystem components. Habitats are mentioned only through the reference to foodwebs. The targets can be considered to cover partially D1 and D4 but they do not cover D6 on seafloor integrity (apart from the indicator on fishing techniques which could impact the seafloor). 

While the indicators are potentially measurable, they are not further specified through threshold values and baselines, which means that they cannot be used to assess the achievement of the sub-target. Consequently, the sub-targets lack the attributes that would make them SMART (e.g. threshold values and baselines).

Germany (Baltic Sea);D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor and criteria levels. The definition is not a mere reproduction of the definition of the MSFD but it is not consistent in the reporting sheets and in the paper report – the GES definition in the reporting sheets is much more detailed than in the paper report but contains what is considered to be accompanying text (which has not been reproduced here – see cross cutting section). Germany’s definitions for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are identical, although it should be noted that the Wadden Sea is object of a specific mention in the accompanying text to the GES definition of the North Sea, and therefore, has been analysed in conjunction. All criteria laid out for Descriptor 10 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated in the GES defintion. 

The definition takes into account time and scale changes (if permanent changes, only local consequences). It also takes into consideration cumulative impacts and identifies potentially impaired ecosystems and populations. The GES definition is consistent with to the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters but does not include any mention to the OSPAR or HELCOM approaches.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany indicates that hydrological and hydrographical analyses of its marine waters are carried out by federal and State authorities but recognizes that there is no agreed assessment procedure. It is stated that in order to identify gaps and adopt quantitative indicators and threshold monitoring programmes (2014) and action plans (2015) will be put in place. The initial assessment of permanent hydrographical alterations is therefore mainly qualitative and there is no reference to the proportion of the environment affected or to trends and the current status of the waters. The information reported is very similar for both marine regions – the North Sea and the Baltic Sea – apart from the mention to some specific projects causing the pressure.

Changes in the temperature profile are attributed to the numerous routes of underground power cables and to cooling water discharged from power plants. Changes in the salinity regime are also reported to occur in the transitional and coastal waters. The impact of permanent hydrographical alterations in water column and seabed habitats is described in very general terms, indicating that the overall effects are small if compared with other pressures and occur mainly at local level. It is also reported that the impact on functional groups has still not been adequately studied.

Germany has also reported on marine acidification, however, it is recognized that there is not enough data available and therefore the assessment is not very detailed. Industry, agriculture, forestry and urban discharges are listed as the main causes of pressure, which reportedly affects 25-50% of the water column habitats (there is no assessment of seabed habitats). No status or trend assessment are reported but it is mentioned that the recording of the pH values carried out in the German Bight  (North Sea) in the winters of 1990 to 2010 and between Luebeck and Helsinki (Baltic Sea) since 2003 shows no significant changes in the acidification of marine waters.";The initial assessment of Germany for permanent hydrographical alterations is assessed as partially adequate.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined three targets and several associated parameters to address Descriptor 7 both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report.  The first target is different for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The other two targets are common to both regions. The first target for the North Sea addresses specifically the intertidal zone of the Wadden Sea. The first target for the Baltic Sea addresses cumulative effects of physical interventions (with a list of human activities) and overlaps with the second target, which is common to both regions, as it also addresses impacts on marine ecosystems. Germany has also indicated that targets addressing D3 and D11 will also contribute to tackling some of the pressures reported under D7, however these targets are analysed in those chapters.

Only qualitative targets have been established. They cannot be considered as SMART as only very general orientations are given about the way these targets could be assessed (“measurement, modelling charting”). In addition, no time reference is given. Although the main potential impacts on the ecosystem to be controlled are addressed (“habitats functions”, “decline of population”), no target is provided for specific levels of pressures or human activities in order to actually control them. Germany does not provide indicators but rather lists of parameters that should be assessed. These parameters however are not associated with any threshold values. 

No direct reference is made in the targets to compliance with existing regulatory regimes (e.g. EIAs) or to the WFD normative definitions for coastal waters. In the accompanying text in the paper report, Germany mentions compliance with the WFD, the RSCs and the CBD as well as the necessity for EIAs to take into account local impacts and cumulative effects. Germany mentions that the objective is mainly to ‘maintain a natural state’. It seems to indicate that Germany considers that it is already in a ‘natural state’ and the role of the targets is to maintain such state by targeting physical interventions (again it is not clear whether only new interventions are addressed by the targets). 

No indication is provided about spatial scale in the targets but in the accompanying text to the targets, Germany refers to the findings of the initial assessment that most changes are small and localised and mentions that most interventions take place on the coast.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Germany for D7 is assessed as inadequate.

Germany (Baltic Sea);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for D8 for the Baltic Sea at descriptor and criteria levels in the paper report and at descriptor and indicator levels in the reporting sheet. The approach used by Germany for the Baltic Sea is very similar to that used for the North Sea except that instead of applying OSPAR’s EAC, Germany proposes to apply HELCOM’s environmental objectives, defined in the “Hazardous substances” segment of the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan. 

In terms of the substances covered, these are the same as for the North Sea except for the OSPAR substances. As for the North Sea, it is presumed that substances not covered by the EQS but covered by HELCOM are addressed by the German GES definition. These include a number of PCB congeners and dioxins. 

Concentrations of contaminants
The HELCOM BSAP states that the concentrations of non-synthetic substances should be that of naturally occurring substances and for man-made synthetic substances should be close to zero. Under indicator 8.2.1, Germany states however that the BSAP objective for contaminants that concentrations should be near background levels “cannot be used as a criterion for the achievement of the GES, but rather reflects the precautionary principle”. It is unclear whether this applies to the whole GES definition or only to biological effects. 

As for the North Sea, Germany has chosen to apply a combination of the EQS and HELCOM approaches. The HELCOM environmental assessment criteria, which are partly based on OSPAR’s EAC and are sometimes risk-based, include ecotoxicological threshold values for concentrations in sediment and biota. The approach chosen by Germany for the Baltic Sea therefore also covers the three matrices (water through the EQS and sediment and biota through the HELCOM’s criteria). Similarly to the North Sea, no indication is provided on the hierarchy/prioritisation between the two approaches when uncertainty/conflict arises (see North Sea assessment). As for the North Sea, no indication is provided on the aggregation rules to be used in order to determine whether an area is at GES or not. 

In addition to limiting concentrations of hazardous substances, the BSAP states that radioactivity should be at pre-Chernobyl levels. By integrating the BSAP objectives in its GES definition, Germany de facto covers radionuclides in its GES definition.  

Effects of contaminants
In terms of effects of contaminants, Germany applies a very similar approach as the North Sea, just changing the standards to be used, from OSPAR to HELCOM. In addition, it refers to the CHASE method developed under HELCOM for the integrated assessment of contaminants and biological effects but only as a possibility to consider rather than the definitive approach to be used for the assessment of GES.  One indicator which is used by Germany also for the Baltic Sea is oiled birds however it is unclear whether Germany intends to use the OSPAR EcoQO on oiled birds also in the Baltic Sea or if it will develop a specific standard. ";The GES definition for D8 for the Baltic Sea is considered partially adequate. Germany has defined GES for the two criteria of the Commission Decision (concentrations and effects of contaminants), using at least the minimum requirements (EQS) and complementing with the use of HELCOM’s recommended environmental assessment criteria and environmental quality objectives. There are a number of uncertainties related to the potential conflicts/overlaps/gaps in the use of both EQS and HELCOM’s criteria and Germany mentions the application of the precautionary principle because of these uncertainties.  It should also be noted that while some of HELCOM’s EAC are risk-based (similarly to the EU EQS) and more tailored to marine water assessments than the EQS, the EU has not recognized that HELCOM’s EAC provide an equivalent protection to that theoretically provided by the EQSD.  Finally, the introduction of the terms “possible basis” creates uncertainty as to the level of commitment by Germany with regard to its GES definition.;"- GES defined for the two criteria of the Decision
- Application of the EQS and complementing with HELCOM standards
- No explanation of potential conflict between the two methods but mention the precautionary principle
- Addition of term “possible basis” creates uncertainty";2;Partially adequate
Germany (Baltic Sea);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany reports to a similar level of details for the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions, using the same methodology to make an assessment of the current levels of and impacts from the contamination pressure. The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Germany provides a detailed description of the main sources of contamination by man-made substances. The assessment considers polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs), chlorinated compounds (including PCBs, DDT group, HCHs), brominated (e.g. PBDEs), fluorinated (e.g. PFCs such as PFOS) and polar nitrogen and phosphorus-containing compounds. The main sources of contamination by man-made substances are industrial production (via rivers), atmospheric deposition or point sources (e.g. offshore activities or the disposal of dredged material). The description however is mostly qualitative. Germany does not provide a quantitative estimate of the inputs of contaminants from these various sources and provides qualitative trends for PAHs in the North Sea (stable) and POPs in the Baltic (decreasing) and quantitative trends for lindane in the Baltic (80% decline between 1999 and 2009). In the background report to the initial assessment however, Germany provides a table with quantitative inputs of different POP substances up to 2009. In the Baltic Sea, Germany makes a spatial assessment of concentration levels (e.g. highest concentrations of PAHs are found in the Kiel and Flensburg Fjord) and refers to seasonal trends. 

Germany provides a number of qualitative trends for the levels of concentrations in a number of species (e.g. decreasing trends for all selected substances in mussel samples from the North Frisian coast; rising trends for PCBs in mussels at the Darsser location in the Baltic since 2000). Germany has estimated that 75-100% of the Baltic Sea assessment area and 50-75% of the North Sea assessment area is affected by contamination by man-made substances. No assessment has been made of impacts of contaminants on seabed habitats. However, in the reporting sheet, Germany states that 5-25% of seabed habitats are impacted by contamination in both regions. It is not certain where this assessment comes from. With regard to functional groups, Germany makes an assessment of the effects of organotin compounds (mainly TBT) from antifouling paints for ships and other underwater installations on a number of species (Nordic purple snail, Nucella lapillus, beach snail, Littorina littorea, and mud snail, Hydrobia ulvae, mussels), which have led to a decrease of the affected species in highly polluted regions. Germany also mentions the assessment carried out of the health status of fish, on the basis of the results of OSPAR CEMP and using the Fish Disease Index (FDI) for the North Sea, for a number of target species (dab, Plattfischart, flounder, cod and whiting). The results of the assessment are not provided in the reporting sheet but a graph showing the evolution over time of the FDI (between the BAC and the EAC) is provided in the paper report. Additional information is provided on biological effects on marine species at the top of the food web in the paper report. 

With regard to non-synthetic substances, Germany provides quantitative trends for riverine input of mercury and cadmium into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Overall, inputs have declined (North Sea: 12% decline for mercury and 38% decline for cadmium in comparison to 1990; Baltic Sea: 10% decline in mercury in comparison to 1994). In the paper report, Germany provides graphs showing temporal trends from 1990 to 2008 for riverine inputs of Cd, Hg, Cu, Pb and Zn. Other sources (shipping, oil and gas, industry, urban wastewater, etc.) are considered in more detailed in the background report to the initial assessment, with graphs illustrating decreasing trends for all substances from all sources between 1983 and 2005. Germany assesses that 50-75% of the North Sea waters and 25-50% of sediment is affected by contamination by non-synthetic substances. While contamination is increasing in the water, it is said to be decreasing in sediments. It is not certain how Germany has made this assessment. 

In terms of the current level of contamination in the environment, Germany has not made an aggregated judgement but provides a large number of judgements for different contaminants (man-made and natural) measured in different matrices (all three matrices are covered). This is consistent with the fact that Germany has not yet defined aggregation rules that would allow to determine whether an area is at GES or not. For the moment therefore, Germany only provides indications of where concentrations of certain contaminants in certain matrices are considered acceptable or not (e.g. in the North Sea PAH exposure is not acceptable in 55% of all sampling stations). The only judgement made is for pesticides and biocide in biota, which levels are considered acceptable (i.e. status is good). 

The judgements on the levels of contamination by heavy metals are slightly more aggregated than for man-made substances. Germany judges that the current level of contamination in water is acceptable (i.e. status is good) and not acceptable in sediment and biota (i.e. status is not good) for both marine regions. For the North Sea, the thresholds and baselines used to make the various judgements on the acceptability of concentration levels are those defined for GES (EQS and EAC). For the Baltic Sea, the threshold values and baselines used are also the EQS and OSPAR’s EAC/BAC. Germany states that assessment criteria from HELCOM are not yet available but does not provide an indication of its plans to address this gap. For heavy metals, it is quite unclear how Germany has combined measurements using both the EQS and the EAC to achieve aggregated judgements on the current levels of contamination.

Overall Germany concludes, on the basis of 2010 OSPAR QSR, that there are “many problems” in relation to levels of contamination in the OSPAR Region II (North Sea) and that the current status of the Baltic coastal waters is “moderate” to “bad”. It is not certain what this judgement for the Baltic is based on. Germany also mentions that at the time of the first WFD management plans, which used national standards rather than the EQS (which were not yet in place at that time), almost all coastal waters of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea were found to be in good chemical status. No judgement is made on the level of impacts on ecosystem components (seabed habitats or functional groups). 

Germany does not provide any information on data gaps and for the North Sea only mentions the work currently done in the framework of OSPAR to develop further environmental assessment criteria. 

Radionuclides
Germany has made an assessment of contamination by radionuclides, describing, for the North Sea, the various sources of contamination: land- and air-based (nuclear power plants in operation – Brokdorf, Emsland, Count, Grohnde, Neckarwestheim 2 and Phillipsburg 2 – and being dismantled – Lingen, Mülheim-Kärlich Obrigheim Rheinberg, Stade and Würgassen) and sea-based (discharges of natural radionuclides from gas platform (Pb-210, Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228)). In the background documents of the initial assessment, Germany provides a number of graphs of inputs of radioactive substances from different substances over time (up to 2009). For the Baltic, Germany mentions that the greatest source of anthropogenic inputs of radionuclides comes from Chernobyl accident. Germany assesses that according to current knowledge, discharges from nuclear plants and from the gas platform are so low that the proportion of introduced into the North and Baltic seas by radioactive materials is negligible and concentrations cannot be detected. No assessment is made of impacts specifically from radionuclides on ecosystem components. No judgement is made on the current levels of and impacts from contamination by radionuclides. For the Baltic Sea, Germany refers to the HELCOM thematic assessment on “Radioactivity in the Baltic Sea, 1999-2006”.  

In terms of knowledge gaps, Germany mentions that to date there is a gap in the development of assessment criteria for radionuclides (threshold values and baselines).

Acute pollution events
While limited information is presented in the reporting sheet on contamination by acute pollution events, the paper report contains a short description of the number of oil spills and the regulations in place within MARPOL. It also describes the release of other types of substances into the marine environment. Germany mentions that in recent years, no major accidents have occurred but acknowledges that there are gaps in knowledge/data (without specifying which exactly). In terms of future plans, Germany mentions in the reporting sheets the need for a detailed gap analysis, the development of indicators and the quantification of reference and threshold values following the implementation of the monitoring programme in 2014 and the programme of measures in 2015. ";The initial assessment of contamination of the North Sea and Baltic Sea by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered adequate. Germany provides a detailed description of the sources and contaminants concerned and, despite the lack of quantification of input loads, provides indicative trends. It assesses some of the impacts on ecosystem components but does not cover seabed habitats. It refers to RSC existing assessments (OSPAR QSR and HELCOM assessments). It makes a number of judgements on the levels of contamination in reference to the EQS and OSPAR’s EAC. ;"- Detailed description of sources of contamination and indicative trends of input loads
- Assessment of impacts on functional groups but not seabed habitats
- Judgements on the level of contamination in reference to EQS and HELCOM (but not aggregated)";3;Adequate
Germany (Baltic Sea);D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined five sub-targets related to contamination by hazardous substances under the general heading of Target UZ2 “Seas without contamination by pollutants” for both marine regions. Germany has mentioned that Target UZ5 on “Seas without exposure to litter” is also relevant for D8. While this is duly noted in the context of this analysis, the assessment of Target UZ5 is done in the section on D10. The sub-targets on contamination by hazardous substances cover the criteria and indicators (to a certain extent) of the Commission Decision and are strongly related to the GES for D8 defined by Germany. 

Germany addresses the various sources of contamination (riverine inputs, atmospheric deposition, sea-based contamination) and addresses the specific issue of oil and oil products. The targets themselves are quite general, using terms such as “further reduced” and “avoided”. In a few cases, the indicator(s) associated with the target is associated with a threshold value and a baseline. This is the case for sub-targets 1 and 5, for which it is specified, in the reporting sheets, that the threshold values are those set under national surface water regulations, the WFD, the EQSD and the OSPAR 2009-2 agreement for the North Sea / assessment procedures used by HELCOM for the Baltic Sea (and the TMAP for the Wadden Sea). It is also mentioned that limit values for sediment and biota still need to be developed. It is unclear why the limit values defined for sediment and biota at EU and RSC levels (EQS and EAC/ERL) are not used for these targets. 

These two sub-targets on concentrations of contaminants are not pressure-targets. They are potentially measurable but lack specificity regarding the substances covered and the approach to be prioritised. They are actually rather reformulation of GES than targets to help achieve GES. Sub-target 5 also addresses pollution effects and is associated with an indicator on biological effects of contaminants according to ICES/OSPAR for the North Sea and ICES/HELCOM CORESET for the Baltic. In the reporting sheet, Germany specifies that the standard to be used for this target is the OSPAR assessment criteria for TBT (imposex EcoQO) for the North Sea and the “assessment procedures used by HELCOM” for the Baltic, which is rather unspecific. No mention is made of the other OSPAR EcoQOs related to contaminants. 

Sub-target 2 and 3 also relate to concentrations of contaminants but focus on pressures from sea-based activities (shipping and oil&gas). The first one, focusing on atmospheric contamination, is not specified by an indicator and/or threshold values or an indication of the activities targeted. It is generic and not measurable because not associated with specific reference levels. Sub-target 3 is more specific, referring to oil&gas activities and shipping and to the MARPOL convention for the inputs from shipping. It mentions that the MARPOL convention should be revised but does not propose different threshold values for inputs from ships. None of the indicators associated with sub-targets 2 and 3 are further specified with threshold values or baselines. Germany acknowledges that further work is needed for these sub-targets in order to make them operational. Such work should be done in coordination with neighbouring countries. In addition, sector-specific targets could be defined after the design of the programme of measure in 2015.

For sub-target 4 on the reduction of input of oil and oil products, whether legal, illegal or accidental, no threshold values is defined but Germany refers to the MARPOL convention and the standards agreed in this framework. As for other contaminants, it mentions that MARPOL should be revised to achieve a further decrease of inputs of contaminants but does not provide different threshold values for its target. While an indicator is added on the oiled birds, it is not further specified with a threshold or reference value. OSPAR’s EcoQO on oiled guillemots is not mentioned.  

In the accompanying text to the targets, Germany mentions the links between the objectives of D8 and other descriptors (in particular D9, 1, 3, 4 and 6). It also mentions the link with MPAs and the CBD and the need for regional cooperation to tackle transboundary pollution.  ";The set of targets defined by Germany to cover D8 is considered partially adequate. The targets cover all the elements of the GES definition (and of the Commission Decision) but they are not all specific. The targets that are specific (sub-targets 1 and 5) are rather expressions of GES (using exactly the same threshold and reference values) than actual targets to help achieve GES (e.g. by targeting a pressure). The pressure targets on shipping are more specific because related to MARPOL standards but Germany acknowledges that MARPOL should be revised without proposing different standards for its targets. Considering their lack of specificity, it is not clear whether these targets are sufficient to achieve GES by 2020.;"- Address the various sources of contaminations
- Many pressure targets
- Some quantification of indicators (threshold values) but not systematically
- Reference to MARPOL but lack of ambition";2;Partially adequate
Germany (Baltic Sea);D8;Consistency ;;"The initial assessment of pressures and impacts from contamination is relatively consistent with the definition of GES. However, Germany does not address other biological effects than imposex in the initial assessment whereas more are included in the GES definition. For the Baltic Sea, Germany uses OSPAR standards to make a judgement on current status, mentioning that HELCOM standards are not yet developed, but the GES definition is based on HELCOM standards. 

The setting of environment targets is also consistent with the initial assessment of pressure and impacts considering that the targets are quite general. The targets use the same standards as the GES definition except that MARPOL, mentioned in the targets and the initial assessment, is not mentioned in the GES definition. In addition, as for the initial assessment, other biological effects than imposex (e.g. covered by other OSPAR EcoQOs) are not covered by the environmental targets, leaving uncertainty with regard to whether GES for all biological effects will be achieved by 2020. For the Baltic Sea, the target on biological effects of contaminants refers to HELCOM CORESET which is not mentioned in the GES or the initial assessment. ";;;;
Germany (Baltic Sea);D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for D9 at descriptor level in the paper report and the reporting sheets. The GES definition is the same for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Germany does not mention the Commission Decision criterion and indicators. 

The definition refers to EU maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs. In the accompanying text, Germany refers to Regulation 1881/2006 (but does not mention its amendments 835/2011 and 1259/2011). Germany also refers to Directive 2006/113/EC on the quality of shellfish waters and to a national 1991 regulation on pesticide. No mention is made of the substances monitored but it is inferred that these are the substances covered by Regulation 1881/2006. No mention is made of other substances of relevance in fish and other seafood. Germany does not provide any details on the foodstuffs that will be monitored suggesting again that it will use those laid out in the Regulation, without further specification of foodstuffs particularly relevant for Germany. No aggregation rule is defined and no criterion is provided in case concentrations exceed regulatory levels. 

Germany mentions the links between D9 and D8 and in particular that achieving D8 will help achievement of D9 (but not necessarily the other way round as food monitoring and environmental monitoring have different requirements). Germany points out the difficulties to trace the origin of the sampled fish and seafood but does not mention any plans to address this issue. ";The GES definition for D9 for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea is considered partially adequate. The definition refers to the relevant EU Regulation (1881/2006) but does not mention its amendments. It does however refer to Directive 2006/113/EC thereby including microbial pathogens in the scope of the GES definition, which is considered a good practice. No plan is proposed to address the issue of traceability of the fish and seafood samples.  It is not defined for the second part of criterion 9.1 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded.;"- Reference to Regulation 1881/2006 (although not directly)

Germany (Baltic Sea);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany reports to a similar level of details for the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions. The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
In the reporting sheets, Germany only provides a very limited description of the fish and seafood market, risks to human health and the need to comply with EU Regulation 1881/2006. In addition, in the paper report, Germany provides a quantitative assessment of current levels of concentrations of a number of substances (dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in cod liver, and methylmercury in cod). More information related to the health status of fish (using the Fish Disease Index) has been reported by Germany and integrated in the assessment under D8 however. 

Germany justifies this limited assessment by stating that data from regular food monitoring is not part of the initial assessment for the MSFD. It does not provide any indication of possible changes to this situation or plans to address data and assessment gaps. 

Germany does not make an aggregated judgement on the current levels of concentrations in relation to regulatory levels. In the reporting sheets, it seems that Germany integrates the EU limit values for foodstuffs in its assessment of levels of non-synthetic substances in biota (fish).  In any case it is rather unclear and there is no detail of the fish species and the substances measured. It is also not clear how these results based on Regulation 1881/2006 (if that is the case) have been combined with other measurements of non-synthetic substances in biota (mussels and fish), based on EQS and EAC thresholds, to achieve a judgement that current levels are not acceptable (i.e. status is not good). 

Radionuclides
No separate assessment has been made of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption by radionuclides.

Microbial pathogens
Germany has made an initial assessment on microbial pathogens in the reporting sheets and in the paper report. Impacts from microbial pathogens have been assessed, for bathing water and shellfish waters. There is no actual judgement on the status is given, but it is stated that the status is ‘according to shellfish water directive’.  The trend of pressure is considered a stable. The main cause for pressure has not been given. ";The initial assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances and by microbial pathogens made by Germany is considered partially adequate. Germany provides limited information on contamination of fish and seafood. It only makes an assessment of current levels of concentrations for a limited number of substances in cod and cod liver and does not make a judgement in relation to Regulation 1881/2006. It does not describe data gaps but justifies its limited reporting by stating that food monitoring is not in the scope of the MSFD. It does not provide plans to address this gap. ;"- Limited information provided on contamination of fish and seafood (but includes assessment of microbial pathogens)

Germany (Baltic Sea);D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"D9 is covered by the target UZ2 “Seas without contamination by pollutants”, which has already been assessed under D8 (which is why all the indicators are not reported again in this section). 

The links between D9 and D8 are described in detail with a mention that achieving the objectives of D8 should help achieve the objectives of D9 considering that D8 standards are stricter. In addition, Germany has specified one indicator on contaminant levels in seafood according to EU limits. Germany specifies in the reporting sheets that the threshold values for this indicator are those set in Regulation 1881/2006, Directive 2006/113/EC and the 1991 national regulation on pesticides. The indicator is very similar to the GES definition. ";The set of targets and indicators on contaminants defined by Germany is considered partially adequate to cover D9. Only one indicator specifically addresses D9 and it is rather an expression of GES than part of an operational target that would help achieve GES (e.g. by focusing on relevant species for human consumption or by using trends rather than compliance to regulatory levels as indicators of change) but it is specific and measurable. ;"- Only one target specific to D9, the others are targets on contamination of the marine environment by hazardous substances (D8)
- Target defined is rather an expression of GES but it is specific and measurable";2;Partially adequate
Germany (Baltic Sea);D9;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the current pressure from contamination on fish and seafood is not consistent with the definition of GES and the setting of targets. It refers only to the Fish Disease Index (FDI), which is not an indicator for human consumption, and to concentration levels of certain substances in cod and cod liver. Neither these substances nor cod are referred to in the GES or the targets. 

The assessment of microbial pathogens and the reference to the Shellfish Water Directive in the initial assessment is consistent with the inclusion of the Shellfish Water Directive as a standard in the GES definition.  

The set of targets and indicator that are said to cover D9 are consistent with the GES definition as they both refer to compliance with EU standards. ";;;;
Germany (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for the biodiversity descriptors at the descriptor level. In the paper report, it has concluded that there is currently no possibility to formulate a GES for biodiversity since there is currently no national or international method which integrates all the individual aspects. 

The German GES definition that has been provided does not apply the structure of the 2010 Commission Decision (criteria and indicators) but rather lists the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Habitats and Birds Directive, the OSPAR Ecological Quality Objectives (EcQOq) and the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). It also refers to other targets for species/species groups under various international conventions such as ASCOBANS in its general definition of GES. The objectives and targets set forth by these pieces of legislation and agreements should be met in order for the Germany waters to be at GES for biodiversity. 

There are however some uncertainties in the phrasing by Germany, for example it is not clear whether all EcoQOs or only specific ones are to be met in order to achieve GES. In regard to targets for species and species groups, ASCOBANS is given as an example of a convention for which the targets should be met; this leaves uncertainty regarding the actual conventions and targets that will be used when assessing the achievement of GES i.e. which convention applies when and for what. Furthermore Germany does not seem to have done a gap-analysis to determine whether these existing mechanisms fully cover the MSFD. As an example, Germany mentions in the accompanying text that the WFD and MSFD overlap in coastal regions but it is unclear how Germany intends to tackle the marine area covered under the MSFD but not by the WFD. Germany does provide in their annexes an overview of how certain aspects of the various pieces of legislation can be used to set indicators and provide thresholds for Descriptor 1 and 4 but does not commit to this analysis stating that these are possible options. Descriptor 6 appears not to be covered either by the GES definition or by the possible indicators included in Annex 2.

Germany does not provide a holistic definition of GES at the ecosystem level. 

In the reporting sheets, Germany provides an extensive list of the pressures and physical/chemical/biological features covered by the GES definition but it is not clear how this specifies further the GES definition as it is stated.  According to Germany’s definition, only listed/protected species are covered by the definition of GES. ";The GES definition covering Descriptors 1,4 and 6 as defined by Germany is considered inadequate. The GES does not go beyond existing pieces of legislation and does not assess whether these are sufficient to achieve the objectives of the MSFD. Germany has also concluded that due to a lack of national and international standards it was impossible to define GES for the biodiversity descriptors. This justification is not considered sufficient to explain why Germany has not provided a GES definition covering all elements of biodiversity (e.g. food webs, seafloor integrity).;"- The definition does not go further than listing existing legislation and agreements
- No holistic definition at the ecosystem level
- All relevant species and habitats are not covered, only listed/protected ones
- Justification that no method exist to define GES for biodiversity is judged as insufficient";1;Inadequate
Germany (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Germany has reported on the following species groups: birds, fish and marine mammals. However, the information in the reporting sheets covers only birds. Germany states that are currently no methods developed to analyse and assess functional groups but does not specify how to address these knowledge gaps. In the letter submitted to the Commission in response to the completeness check, Germany mentions that as agreed within the MSFD CIS process, the information on mammals, fish and cephalopods will be submitted through the 2013 reporting under the Habitats Directive. However this suggests that only protected/listed species will be reported on at that time. 

In the reporting sheets seven functional groups of birds are listed but the information is limited. No trends are provided but abundance is sometimes quantified. Germany lists the specific species (coming from ICES and national lists) that are included in these functional groups and indicates that the assignment of specific species to the predefined functional groups is a test and has not been coordinated within the RSC and with neighbouring countries. The main pressures impacting each functional group are also listed.

In relation to fish, the German paper report mentions the relevant lists of endangered species and in some cases reports their status and indicates general trends. Relevant literature is cited and the main pressures listed. In addition, the Habitats Directive, ICES, OSPAR and HELCOM are mentioned. Regarding marine mammals, Germany indicates in the paper report that these are mostly threatened by fishing, pollution and underwater noise but mentions also other sources of pressure such as shipping or oil and gas extraction. Like for fish the relevant conventions and legal instruments are also referred to i.e. the Habitats Directive, OSPAR, HELCOM and ASCOBANS. The conservation status of some specific species is provided (e.g. the harbour seal in the North Sea). 

Habitats
The initial assessment carried out Germany on the habitats in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea covers practically only seabed habitats. Germany acknowledges that while there is good information on areas near the coast there is only little knowledge about other areas. In addition, Germany recognizes that the existing monitoring does not match the requirements of the MSFD and therefore not all assessment areas could be fully monitored for all features and characteristics, indicating that multi-scale spatial models, which consider various pressures and biotope types, can be a good approach for future assessments.

Germany has reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. For both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, the following predominant habitats were listed: Shallow Sublittoral Coarse Sediment, Shallow Sublittoral Sand, Shallow Sublittoral Mud, Shallow Sublittoral Mixed Sediment, Shelf Sublittoral Coarse Sediment, Shelf Sublittoral Mud and Shelf Sublittoral Mixed Sediment. In addition, for the Baltic Sea Germany mentioned Reduced Salinity Water and Variable Salinity (estuarine) Water habitats. For predominant habitats the assessment includes descriptions of habitat distribution, extent and condition are always provided. For some habitat types, the localisation and quantification of extent and distribution, as well as the main pressures affecting each habitat are also covered. However, no trends are or definitive judgements are provided.

Germany has also reported on special habitats. For the North Sea these come from the OSPAR Convention – seagrass beds, macrophytobenthos, mussel beds, seapens and burrowing megafauna, Sabellaria reefs and species-rich coarse sand, gravel and maerl areas. For the Baltic Sea, the following special habitats were reported: seagrass beds, macrophytobenthos, mussel beds, species-rich coarse sand, gravel and maerl areas, offshore deep-water below the halocline, gravel seabed with Ophelia and maerl. In relation to special habitat the assessment covers the description of habitat distribution, extent and condition with a certain level of quantification as well as distribution range and the main pressures affecting each habitat. In addition, the status in relation to natural conditions is provided (altered for most habitats). These judgements were based on experts assessment and WFD orientation and used as baseline the historical stocks and spreads of some species (mussels).

Ecosystems
No assessment has been made of ecosystems. ";The initial assessment by Germany of biological features is considered partially adequate. Not all habitat types and species groups are covered, and there is not enough information on the relevant pressures. In addition, there is no information on ecosystems even if it is likely that some information exists that would have allowed some assessment. Many of the components missing above could be assessed together and thus make a start towards ecosystems assessment. The information reported is mostly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Judgements on status were provided in some cases. Reference is made to existing international conservation agreements and to the Habitats Directive but the justification of reporting under the Habitats Directive timeframe is only relevant for protected/listed species. There is still an important gaps with regard to other species groups. Germany states an ambition to address the knowledge gaps before 2018. This time-frame for supplying information may be too late for the overall aim of GES by 2020.;"Features:

Germany (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has set one overall target UZ3 on “Seas without damage to marine species or habitats due to impacts from human activities” and four sub-targets for biodiversity which apply to all three biodiversity Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 along, with various associated indicators. 

The sub-targets address ‘no-take’ zones and times, improvements in fishing gear selectivity, protection of migratory pathways of diadromous species, regeneration and restoration of damaged ecosystem components and non-indigenous species (NIS). The sub-target on NIS is assessed under Section 4 on D2. The sub-targets are mostly pressure targets, which is consistent with the general heading of Target UZ3. They do not cover the criteria/indicators of the Commission Decision systematically. They are only specific for a certain pressures (e.g. by-catch) or parameters (e.g. resting areas). They refer to functional groups in the context of foodwebs and migratory species and to protected/listed species but there is no systematic and consistent coverage of all ecosystem components. Habitats are mentioned only through the reference to foodwebs. The targets can be considered to cover partially D1 and D4 but they do not cover D6 on seafloor integrity (apart from the indicator on fishing techniques which could impact the seafloor). 

While the indicators are potentially measurable, they are not further specified through threshold values and baselines, which means that they cannot be used to assess the achievement of the sub-target. Consequently, the sub-targets lack the attributes that would make them SMART (e.g. threshold values and baselines). 

No mention is made of the operational targets/objectives of the various EU/regional/international agreements and mechanisms used to define GES. ";The targets as defined by Germany are considered partially adequate. The targets as a set do not fully address the three biodiversity descriptors and lack attributes that make them SMART, although they are potentially measurable.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D1;Consistency ;;"Germany has stated that GES for biodiversity can currently not be defined due to a lack of standards. A GES definition has been provided, which is not structured using the Commission Decision but instead relies on existing legislation and commitments to define the GES for Descriptor 1, 4 and 6. The GES definition is the same for all three biodiversity descriptors but has been adjusted for the North Sea and Baltic sub-region to refer to the correct policy instruments in those regions.  There is no conclusive clarification provided on how these pieces of legislation and commitments cover the MSFD. 

The fact that the initial assessment mentions that existing monitoring does not match the requirements of the MSFD suggests that the German approach likely does not fully cover all the MSFD requirements. Furthermore the targets as provided for in Article 10 do not apply or directly rely on targets from existing pieces of legislation and commitments. There is therefore no consistency in the approach used for setting the GES definition and the targets. In general the biodiversity targets set in Article 10 do not correspond to the GES definition. Overall both the GES definitions and the targets imply a lack of ambition to move beyond existing legislation and commitments. The GES definition and targets also lack clear baselines and thresholds although some are implicit in the legislation and guidelines that are part of the GES definition. ";;;;
Germany (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor level. The criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 10 in the 2010 Commission Decision are not incorporated. A similar GES definition is used for both regions – the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The GES definition is based on the definition at descriptor level in the Decision, but further elaboration is not provided. It is also mentioned that marine litter should not support the introduction and spread of non-native species.

The German report mentions the lack of an adequate evaluation system on the environmental effects of waste in the sea. Possible thresholds are given for criterion 10.2 but Germany claims that until adequate evaluation methods of the aspect of GES are found, the definition of Descriptor 10 may be used as a qualitative description of the good environmental status. Germany also notes that even if the sources are identified, the distribution of waste in the sea is highly variable over time and meteorological and hydrodynamic fluctuations.

The two relevant regional instruments (OSPAR and HELCOM) appear to have been taken into account in the respective areas and are referred to in accompanying texts.

Germany has reported on the level of pressure on the coastline and, with less detail, on the water column and seabed. Trends are only given for the coastline (stable) but a status assessment is made in relation to both the coastline (not good) and the water column (not good). Germany has reported on the impact of marine litter on water column habitats (but not on seabed habitats), however, it did not provide any trends or make a definitive judgement on their status.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined three targets and four associated indicators, under the general heading of Target UZ5 on “Seas without exposure to marine litter” to address Descriptor 10. The targets are more developed in the reporting sheets than in the paper report and are applicable to both marine regions: the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The targets are made measurable through the associated indicators which, for that reason, are analysed below.

The indicator 5.1.1 is intrinsically measurable, assuming it is further specified which materials and categories are measured. However, it is unclear where the waste will be monitored (beach, surface, water column, sea bed). It would be beneficial to further breakdown this indicator and give more detail e.g. on the different areas (floating, water column, sea bed, beach) where the waste materials are collected.

The three other indicators address birds. In relation to the indicator 5.2.1, the methodology and threshold value for Northern Fulmars is measurable and well developed; however, indicators for other species still have to be developed. The indicator 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 address entanglement of birds and are intrinsically measurable. Nonetheless, threshold values are not yet defined and the other indicator species still have to be defined.

All indicators monitor the end-of-pipe impact and are expected not have influence on the pressures/sources of marine litter. All aspects of are MSFD covered and the long term objectives are ambitious. Yet, since no threshold values are set, the actual ambition on the short to medium-term cannot be assessed.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany has carried out an initial assessment on the current level of pressure resulting from underwater noise and its impacts for both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The main contributors are clearly identified and there is a lot of accompanying text that refers to scientific background information - this is true both for 11.1.1 and 11.2.1. In any case, Germany acknowledges that there are currently few data on natural and anthropogenic noise pollution in its marine waters and that standardized methods for measuring and analysing the impacts of noise are still missing. 

The information provided by Germany is extensive and mostly qualitative but there is an attempt to quantify some parameters. Both loud, low and mid-frequency impulsive sounds and continuous low frequency sounds are reported but there is no information on the proportion of the area affected by underwater noise. No judgement on the level of pressure is provided (due to lack of available data) but, for loud, low and mid-frequency impulsive sounds a trend is provided – it is considered that the level of pressure is declining in both marine regions. For both regions, shipping, renewable energy structures and the extraction of oil and gas are indicated as the main causes of underwater noise. Mammals and toothed whales are mentioned as the species impacted.";The initial assessment of Germany for underwater noise is assessed as adequate.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined one overall target UZ6 “Seas not affected by human applications of energy” to address Descriptor 11. Germany further reports five sub-targets and possible associated indicators to address Descriptor 11. Two targets refer to respectively impulsive sound and continuous sound, and are thus related to the indicators as defined in the Decision. The concept of Germany deviates from the 2010 Commission Decision. The target for impulsive sound is based on maximal sound exposure at the local scale. It is not directly applicable as a tool for managing pressures on a larger scale.  In addition, targets have been defined for the input of anthropogenic heat, electromagnetic and electric fields and light in the marine environment. An additional target is set to addressing the impact of human activities in marine species and habitats in the section on biodiversity.

None of the targets is time-bound and there is no mention to the achievability of GES by 2020. Threshold values are given for some of the targets but not for all. The targets addressing sound refer to “compliance of already existing or to be established threshold values” but it is not entirely clear what this means. In relation to the targets addressing the other pressures, those directed to the introduction of heat and electromagnetic fields are considered clear and measurable, but the target tackling the introduction of light is, again, rather unspecific and not measurable until some thresholds are defined.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Germany for D11 is assessed as partially adequate.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D11;Consistency ;;Germany presents an approach which deviates from the Decision. The reporting however is consistent. In the GES definition and targets, Germany aims to reduce the impact of noise by human activities to marine life. A different approach is used than proposed in the 2010 Commission Decision. Both in the GES definition and the targets, a local-scale EIA based approach is followed (i.e. exposure threshold). For some aspects, Germany is detailed and threshold values are proposed and already nationally applied – mainly for impulsive noise, while for continuous noise and the impact on marine life, less is known. The others sources of energy are also systematically addressed. Germany addresses also the sources of noise, but it is unclear on how this will be achieved. ;;;;
Germany (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The definition of GES for Descriptor 2 applies to both the Baltic Sea and the Greater North Sea sub-regions. It aims at, on the one hand, approaching zero new introductions and, on the other hand, ensuring the absence of impacts from NIS on indigenous species and habitats. The definition is set at descriptor level but relates indirectly to both criteria while remaining very general. 

The accompanying text indicates that Germany relates this definition to the indicator 2.1.1 of the 2010 Commission Decision. It states that ‘good status is reached, if it can be shown that based on the status quo (number of existing non-native species), the introduction of new species have been largely prevented. Therefore, the GES definition as set by Germany does not specifically include the current pressure of NIS and the prevention of spreading or reduction of this already existing pressure. This reflects the fact that the reduction of existing pressure is only possible in a few cases.

The reporting sheet indicates that further development is needed for GES to be operational by 2018. ";The GES definition for D2 is considered as partially adequate. GES is defined in very general terms. It is rather ambitious aiming at zero (or near zero) introduction and prevention of negative impacts from NIS.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany has reported 49 NIS for the North Sea, indicating for each of those the relevant pathway.

Germany provides a very general description of impacts. The main vectors are identified with a ranking provided – shipping (1) and aquaculture (2). 

In the reporting sheet, Germany refers to different studies to conclude that the number of NIS has increased in recent years. Similarly to the Baltic Sea, overall, the trend in pressure by NIS is considered as declining in the future and the pressure in the North Sea is qualified low. This seems in contradiction with the statement that the number of NIS is increasing. For this sub-region as well, Germany recognises that the information, based on scientific literature, is still sketchy. It states that at present there is no assessment for the condition of NIS, but the evaluation as part of the MSFD should enable future assessments.";The initial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered adequate for the Baltic Sea and the North Sea.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"For both marine sub-regions, the same interim sub-target has been set with three associated indicators. It comes under the overall target UZ3 on ‘Seas without damage to marine species or habitats due to impacts of human activities’, which contains a number of other sub-targets dealt with under the biodiversity section (Section 3).

The first sentence of the target is a simple reproduction of the German GES (approaching zero new introductions). Then, the target calls for implementation of preventive measures and timely recording of new species to support the taking of immediate measures. The last sentence refers in general to development and implementation of regulations and conventions.

The target is not SMART. It is not specific referring to ‘preventive measures’, ‘regulations and conventions’, ‘immediate measures’. The associated indicators suggest what these could be: identification of hotspots, selecting and surveying representative ports and aquaculture areas, implementation of the IMO Convention on ballast water . The indicators also imply a risk-based approach. However, the target remains so general that it is not measurable. It is difficult to achieve and not bound by any timeframe.

The target is ambitious as regard the monitoring of new species (recording) and covers the right mix of preventive and immediate measures linked to monitoring. Since the target is very generally formulated it covers all main sources of new introductions. However, these vectors/pathways have not been specifically addressed. Only marine litter is specifically addressed as Germany has also indicated that the target addressing D10 will also contribute to tackling some of the pressures reported under D2, namely transport of NIS through marine litter. This target is analysed in section 10.";The environmental target is considered as inadequate. The target is very general and effectively expresses what is GES and should more appropriately have been reported against Article 9, but lack any focus on reducing pressures and impacts in order to achieve GES.  The indicators are more explicit and shed some light on what would cover the target. However, it is not clear from the target itself. ;"- Only one very general target

Germany (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for Descriptor 3 at the descriptor and criteria levels in the paper report and at the descriptor and indicator levels in the reporting sheets. The definitions are the same for both the Baltic and North Sea. 

Germany has applied all three criteria 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 as well as all the indicators from the 2010 Commission Decision. The threshold value set for indicator 3.1.1 is that all stocks need to be exploited below Fmsy, this is in line with the Commission Decision. For indicator 3.1.2 the threshold has been set at BMSY-trigger or if this is not available SSBpa if it is known for all stocks. This is in line with requirement of the descriptor text as provided in Annex I of the MSFD that all stocks need to be within safe biological limits. For the secondary indicators 3.1.2 and 3.2.2 as well as the indicators for criteria 3.3 thresholds still need to be set, based on knowledge that is currently being developed. 

The thresholds for criteria 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 will be set using ICES advice and are in line with the latest guidance from the Commission.  ";The German GES is considered adequate. The German GES definition has applied all 3 criteria and all indicators from the Commission Decision. The German GES definition requires that the F for all stocks should be below Fmsy which is in line with the Commission Decision. In regard to criteria 3.2.1 all stocks need to be above BMSY-trigger or SSBpa which is in line with the descriptor text in Annex I of the MSFD which requires all stocks to be within safe biological limits. The lack of thresholds for the secondary indicators and indicators for criteria 3.3 is acceptable considering that there is not yet clear guidance on what thresholds should be applied for these indicators. ;"- All stocks should be exploited below Fmsy

Germany (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany reports to a similar level of details for the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions, using the same methodology to make an assessment of the fisheries pressure. The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions.

The German initial assessment is very general and succinct with very general descriptions of fishing activities and some information on specific fish stocks from ICES. In the German assessment it is mentioned for the North Sea that ICES has assessed five species as being in good condition (herring, sandeel, haddock, plaice and pout), one species as moderate (sole) and two species as bad (cod and pollock). No ICES catch recommendations were available for six species. 

In the Baltic, three species are assessed as being exploited above Fmsy (Cod, Herring, Sprat), other stocks were not assessed in respect to Fmsy. The SSB for Cod was assessed as above BMSY-trigger, herring below and for Sprat it was not known. Baltic stocks of flatfish are however described as being generally stable or increasing. ";The initial assessment of Germany is considered partially adequate. The initial assessment is very general and contains only specific data for certain stocks assessed by ICES. The description of fisheries activities is very general and lacks relevant details. ;"- Very general information on fisheries

Germany (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has set one interim target, UZ4, and four separate sub-targets to deal with fisheries, along with 11 associated indicators. The target should be achieved by 2020. Germany has also indicated that targets addressing biodiversity, contaminants and energy will also contribute to tackling some of the pressures reported under D3, however these targets are analysed in the relevant sections.

While the targets cover all three of the Commission Decision criteria, they are not very specific. Stating that all stocks are managed according to MSY principles does not necessarily mean that all stocks will have a SSB that is above BMSY-tripper or SSBpa although it should mean that all stocks will be exploited at Fmsy. It is also interesting to note that associated indicators have been included for fishing mortality but not for the reproductive capacity (SSB, biomass indices). 

Sub-target 2 of target UZ4 deals with age and size structure and mentions all age classes should be included and continue to move towards natural conditions, this however is not sufficient to guarantee that the reproductive capacity of stocks is within safe biological limits. This second condition would be stronger if it was not just mentioned that all age and size classes should be present but also the proportions of the various age classes or a mention that there should be a high or sufficiently high proportion of old, large individuals. 

Sub-target 3 of target UZ4 takes the effects of fisheries into account on the ecosystem but it is more relevant for descriptor D1 and D6. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Germany for Descriptor 3 is assessed as inadequate.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Inadequate; 1):
Germany has defined GES for the biodiversity descriptors at the descriptor level. In the paper report, it has concluded that there is currently no possibility to formulate a GES for biodiversity since there is currently no national or international method which integrates all the individual aspects. 

The German GES definition that has been provided does not apply the structure of the 2010 Commission Decision (criteria and indicators) but rather lists the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Habitats and Birds Directive, the OSPAR Ecological Quality Objectives (EcQOq) and the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). It also refers to other targets for species/species groups under various international conventions such as ASCOBANS in its general definition of GES. The objectives and targets set forth by these pieces of legislation and agreements should be met in order for the Germany waters to be at GES for biodiversity. 

There are however some uncertainties in the phrasing by Germany, for example it is not clear whether all EcoQOs or only specific ones are to be met in order to achieve GES. In regard to targets for species and species groups, ASCOBANS is given as an example of a convention for which the targets should be met; this leaves uncertainty regarding the actual conventions and targets that will be used when assessing the achievement of GES i.e. which convention applies when and for what. Furthermore Germany does not seem to have done a gap-analysis to determine whether these existing mechanisms fully cover the MSFD. As an example, Germany mentions in the accompanying text that the WFD and MSFD overlap in coastal regions but it is unclear how Germany intends to tackle the marine area covered under the MSFD but not by the WFD. Germany does provide in their annexes an overview of how certain aspects of the various pieces of legislation can be used to set indicators and provide thresholds for Descriptor 1 and 4 but does not commit to this analysis stating that these are possible options. Descriptor 6 appears not to be covered either by the GES definition or by the possible indicators included in Annex 2.

Germany does not provide a holistic definition of GES at the ecosystem level. 

In the reporting sheets, Germany provides an extensive list of the pressures and physical/chemical/biological features covered by the GES definition but it is not clear how this specifies further the GES definition as it is stated.  According to Germany’s definition, only listed/protected species are covered by the definition of GES. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The GES definition covering Descriptors 1,4 and 6 as defined by Germany is considered inadequate. The GES does not go beyond existing pieces of legislation and does not assess whether these are sufficient to achieve the objectives of the MSFD. Germany has also concluded that due to a lack of national and international standards it was impossible to define GES for the biodiversity descriptors. This justification is not considered sufficient to explain why Germany has not provided a GES definition covering all elements of biodiversity (e.g. food webs, seafloor integrity).";"- No specific definition for D4

Germany has set one overall target UZ3 on “Seas without damage to marine species or habitats due to impacts from human activities” and four sub-targets for biodiversity which apply to all three biodiversity Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 along, with various associated indicators. 

The sub-targets address ‘no-take’ zones and times, improvements in fishing gear selectivity, protection of migratory pathways of diadromous species, regeneration and restoration of damaged ecosystem components and non-indigenous species (NIS). The sub-target on NIS is assessed under Section 4 on D2. The sub-targets are mostly pressure targets, which is consistent with the general heading of Target UZ3. They do not cover the criteria/indicators of the Commission Decision systematically. They are only specific for a certain pressures (e.g. by-catch) or parameters (e.g. resting areas). They refer to functional groups in the context of foodwebs and migratory species and to protected/listed species but there is no systematic and consistent coverage of all ecosystem components. Habitats are mentioned only through the reference to foodwebs. The targets can be considered to cover partially D1 and D4 but they do not cover D6 on seafloor integrity (apart from the indicator on fishing techniques which could impact the seafloor). 

While the indicators are potentially measurable, they are not further specified through threshold values and baselines, which means that they cannot be used to assess the achievement of the sub-target. Consequently, the sub-targets lack the attributes that would make them SMART (e.g. threshold values and baselines). 

No mention is made of the operational targets/objectives of the various EU/regional/international agreements and mechanisms used to define GES. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The targets as defined by Germany are considered partially adequate. The targets as a set do not fully address the three biodiversity descriptors and lack attributes that make them SMART, although they are potentially measurable.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D4;Consistency ;;"Germany has stated that GES for biodiversity can currently not be defined due to a lack of standards. A GES definition has been provided, which is not structured using the Commission Decision but instead relies on existing legislation and commitments to define the GES for Descriptor 1, 4 and 6. The GES definition is the same for all three biodiversity descriptors but has been adjusted for the North Sea and Baltic sub-region to refer to the correct policy instruments in those regions.  There is no conclusive clarification provided on how these pieces of legislation and commitments cover the MSFD. 

The fact that the initial assessment mentions that existing monitoring does not match the requirements of the MSFD suggests that the German approach likely does not fully cover all the MSFD requirements. Furthermore the targets as provided for in Article 10 do not apply or directly rely on targets from existing pieces of legislation and commitments. There is therefore no consistency in the approach used for setting the GES definition and the targets. In general the biodiversity targets set in Article 10 do not correspond to the GES definition. Overall both the GES definitions and the targets imply a lack of ambition to move beyond existing legislation and commitments. The GES definition and targets also lack clear baselines and thresholds although some are implicit in the legislation and guidelines that are part of the GES definition. ";;;;
Germany (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in the reporting sheets, but only at descriptor level in the paper report. All criteria and indicator laid out for Descriptor 5 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated in the GES definition in the reporting sheets. Germany uses a different definition of GES for D5 for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in order to take into account the relevant guidelines of the applicable regional sea conventions.

Up to 1 nautical mile from shore (coastal waters) Germany uses WFD criteria/indicators for nutrient concentrations, direct and indirect impacts to assess status and beyond that it uses the OSPAR common procedure to assess trophic status. The OSPAR common procedure (OSPAR COMP) is currently under revision, so GES/NON-GES thresholds for some parameters may change; similarly, Germany is awaiting the results of an intercalibration decision, which may affect some thresholds for coastal waters. However, the OSPAR COMP includes a threshold value for nutrient ratios (N:P), based on the Redfield ratio (with a permitted 50% deviation). Chlorophyll levels and water transparency are included in both coastal and offshore waters, although an adaptation of the current coastal methodology is aimed for, at least in offshore waters. The abundance of opportunistic macroalgae is only included in coastal waters; beyond this the indicator is not considered relevant. Changes in floristic composition are considered only in terms of phytoplankton communities (not benthic-pelagic shifts), but threshold values are available for coastal and offshore waters. For perennial macrophytobenthos, an indicator and threshold value is available from WFD monitoring, but as with opportunistic macroalgae the indicator is not considered relevant beyond than 1 nautical mile from shore, however, it is not explained whether or why such communities do not exist there, or occur in only small isolated patches. For dissolved oxygen, threshold values are available for both coastal and offshore waters.

It is not clear whether any disaggregation of WFD indicators/data is required for MSFD assessment purposes. The Trilateral Wadden Sea Cooperation’s (TWC’s) Trilateral Monitoring and Assessment Programme (TMAP) is referred to, but it is the OSPAR approach that is used for offshore waters. The updates to OSPAR COMP should make it suitable for MSFD reporting purposes, providing all relevant criteria are incorporated. ";The GES definition of Germany for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. While the existing OSPAR COMP and WFD indicators do not appear to match fully with MSFD reporting requirements, adaptations to existing methods and thresholds are being made to improve compliance in the future. However, the explanations offered with regard to the inclusion/exclusion of some criteria/indicators (e.g. changes in floristic composition and macrophytobenthos) are too vague to make a full assessment, and quantitative thresholds are not reported, only referred to. For coastal waters some of these WFD thresholds may change as a result of WFD intercalibration exercises, and some quantitative thresholds for offshore waters may still be under development as part of the OSPAR COMP revision. It is not clear what this revision will include. ;"- GES definition encompasses all the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision

Germany (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"For the North Sea, a partial, but not full assessment has been made. Eutrophication impacts are described in outline, and major reductions in nutrient loading since the mid-1980s are reported, but trends and current status (in terms of achieving (or not) GES) are not reported. Germany justifies the lack of pressure trends, i.e. increasing, decreasing or stable nutrient loads, by mentioning that complex modelling is required. Dissolved oxygen status, including hypoxic events, is discussed.

All relevant nutrients are considered, but not organic matter. Nutrient levels, direct and indirect effects of eutrophication are covered, but pressure trends are considered only in terms of long-term reductions (approaching 30 years). Detailed pressure trends which showing changes over a more recent period (e.g. 10 years) are not provided. Major sources/vectors of entry are identified, but only in terms of broad categories, and atmospheric deposition is not considered amongst these – Germany reports agriculture, forestry, urban discharges and shipping as the main causes of eutrophication. 

The contributions of phytoplankton bloom collapse/land-derived organic loading to hypoxic events have not been assessed in the North Sea. Judgements on the level of pressures should have been available from River Basin Management Plans, but are not reported (only on nutrient and organic matter enrichment overall), while judgements on the level of impact have not been possible because of the lack of recognized quantitative thresholds. 

It is indicated however that between 75-100% of the water column and seabed habitats are impacted by eutrophication. It is not clear however how Germany has reached that conclusion. ";The initial assessment of Germany for eutrophication in the North Sea is assessed as partially adequate, because there are some reservations. Only a partial assessment has been carried out and the justifications provided for not having a full assessment are not considered entirely relevant. The trends can/should be based on monitoring data, not modelled data. The statement that detailed meteorological data are required for modelling nutrient loads (but are not available, or the available predictions have huge levels of uncertainty) is only relevant for forecasting. However, for historic trends (over the last 10, 20, etc. years), the argument is not valid, since monitoring data should be available. Likewise, organic load estimates could be derived from historic routine monitoring of discharges, river flows/quality and atmospheric deposition, even if current/historic marine monitoring data are not available. The assessment is both qualitative and quantitative but covers only nutrients, not organic matter, and it does not include all the relevant trends or judgements on pressures or impacts.;"- Partial assessment covering pressures and impacts

Germany (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined one overall target, UZ1, three sub-targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 5 both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report. The targets are the same for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea except for the reference to the RSCs. 

The sub-targets reported are in line with existing OSPAR/HELCOM and WFD objectives for nutrient reduction. These objectives however are unspecific with regard to individual pressures (e.g. point vs. diffuse source-derived emissions into rivers, or industrial or terrestrial vs. marine transport-derived atmospheric NOx emissions), enabling individual countries to identify the most cost-effective means of achieving nutrient load reduction. The sub-targets are measurable, but are qualitative (except the reference to reduction targets for river nutrient load reduction under the WFD in the first sub-target but these are not fully re-stated in the targets). With regard to the second sub-target, the pressure reduction implies the cooperation with and the involvement of other countries, which is referred to in the second part of the target (This should be done in the framework of regional cooperation under OSPAR/HELCOM). 

The qualitative nature of the targets means that they are all achievable and realistic. The indicators for second and third sub-targets are sufficiently specific. However the indicator for the first target is not considered sufficiently specific. While the targets are all pressure- rather than impact-specific, the proposed indicator for the first target is an impact metric. The targets tackle three individual pressures, but those pressures contain various sub-pressures, which are not considered. The targets are consistent in the sense that they all pressure targets, and therefore do not contradict or conflict with each other.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Germany for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The targets are in line with the objectives of GES and are potentially measurable, achievable and realistic, but also merely qualitative and therefore unambitious. All targets address pressures rather than impacts and do not offer greater protection than the existing normatives under WFD and OSPAR/HELCOM. It also remains to be seen whether the nutrient reduction requirements set out in WFD RBMPS are sufficient to achieve GES with regard to eutrophication. The lack of other impact metrics (particularly direct and indirect impacts) means that it is uncertain whether the targets are sufficient to achieve GES.  As per the mention of Germany, the timelines of the WFD and the MSFD differ and therefore it is uncertain whether applying the WFD will ensure achievement of MSFD GES by 2020.;"- All targets are pressure-based
- Potentially measurable, achievable and realistic
- Lack of thresholds
- Not clear whether  they are sufficient for achieving GES";2;Partially adequate
Germany (North East Atlantic);D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of eutrophication and its impacts is consistent with Germany’s definition of GES for both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. 

In the case of the North Sea, MSFD GES is defined in terms of achieving WFD GES in coastal waters and achieving compliance with OSPAR objectives in offshore waters. With regards to the Baltic Sea, GES is defined in terms of achieving existing WFD and HELCOM objectives. For both regions, while the selected WFD normative definitions are aimed at pressure reduction, the overall WFD objective is impact reduction and/or maintenance (as with the MSFD). Relatively little reference is made to made to trophic status improvement (in its broad sense) and MSFD GES for some D5 thresholds have still to be quantified. This is a cause of concern, since the overall MSFD objective (to achieve GES) is still a “moving target.”

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 does not cover all the different pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 5 identified in the initial assessment. It is unclear which different sources of land-derived nutrients are to be targeted within a programme of measures to reduce river nutrient loads; and, likewise, which contributing atmospheric emission sources are to be targeted. Only a single impact is covered by the target-specific indicators (nutrient concentrations at the limnic-marine boundary), and this is considered to be an inappropriate indicator for the target (nutrient loads via rivers to be further reduced). In addition, only the first target is likely to result in substantial pressure reduction, providing the WFD RBMP guidance is followed. The remaining two pressure reduction targets are effectively open-ended and not time-bound, essentially relying on peer pressure rather than legislation to achieve their aims.

Finally, the set of targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 is probably not sufficient to achieve GES. The second and third targets at first appear to be ambitious, and to some extent outside of the MSFD remit since they tackle transboundary inputs, but the qualitative nature of these greatly reduces their likely effectiveness. The first target has the greatest degree of certainty over its achievability, but whether the load reduction is sufficient to achieve GES in either coastal or offshore waters is far from certain. The extent of internal nutrient loading (sediment-water fluxes) from historically elevated nutrient pressures and the contribution of land-derived organic loading to marine hypoxic events remain to be assessed.";;;;
Germany (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Inadequate; 1):

Germany has defined GES for the biodiversity descriptors at the descriptor level. In the paper report, it has concluded that there is currently no possibility to formulate a GES for biodiversity since there is currently no national or international method which integrates all the individual aspects. 

The German GES definition that has been provided does not apply the structure of the 2010 Commission Decision (criteria and indicators) but rather lists the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Habitats and Birds Directive, the OSPAR Ecological Quality Objectives (EcQOq) and the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). It also refers to other targets for species/species groups under various international conventions such as ASCOBANS in its general definition of GES. The objectives and targets set forth by these pieces of legislation and agreements should be met in order for the Germany waters to be at GES for biodiversity. 

There are however some uncertainties in the phrasing by Germany, for example it is not clear whether all EcoQOs or only specific ones are to be met in order to achieve GES. In regard to targets for species and species groups, ASCOBANS is given as an example of a convention for which the targets should be met; this leaves uncertainty regarding the actual conventions and targets that will be used when assessing the achievement of GES i.e. which convention applies when and for what. Furthermore Germany does not seem to have done a gap-analysis to determine whether these existing mechanisms fully cover the MSFD. As an example, Germany mentions in the accompanying text that the WFD and MSFD overlap in coastal regions but it is unclear how Germany intends to tackle the marine area covered under the MSFD but not by the WFD. Germany does provide in their annexes an overview of how certain aspects of the various pieces of legislation can be used to set indicators and provide thresholds for Descriptor 1 and 4 but does not commit to this analysis stating that these are possible options. Descriptor 6 appears not to be covered either by the GES definition or by the possible indicators included in Annex 2.

Germany does not provide a holistic definition of GES at the ecosystem level. 

In the reporting sheets, Germany provides an extensive list of the pressures and physical/chemical/biological features covered by the GES definition but it is not clear how this specifies further the GES definition as it is stated.  According to Germany’s definition, only listed/protected species are covered by the definition of GES. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The GES definition covering Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 as defined by Germany is considered inadequate. The GES does not go beyond existing pieces of legislation and does not assess whether these are sufficient to achieve the objectives of the MSFD. Germany has also concluded that due to a lack of national and international standards it was impossible to define GES for the biodiversity descriptors. This justification is not considered sufficient to explain why Germany has not provided a GES definition covering all elements of biodiversity (e.g. food webs, seafloor integrity).";"- No specific definition for D6
– Germany mentions that D4 is covered by the D1 definition

Germany (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

Germany has carried out an initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage for both the North Sea and in the Baltic Sea (however it should be noted that the assessments on physical damage are only reported in the paper report). Germany acknowledges the need to collect more information concerning sediment dispersal and marine sublittoral habitat types, as well as a more general need for ecosystem models for impact assessment but it does not state any plans for acquiring this information, or carrying out the required assessment of current status (and directions of change – ongoing and/or to desired state).

Explanations of the main causes of physical loss in the area are described, and a quantification of the numbers of relevant structures and spatial extent of impacts are given. Germany lists solid waste disposal and offshore structures as the main causes of physical loss. In relation to shipment of dredged material, it is reported that there is currently no sediment extraction in the German EEZ both in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. For the coastal areas and territorial sea, figures are given for the North Sea (2002-2007) and the Baltic Sea (1999-2009). The main structures are also listed. In the North Sea these include wind turbines, natural gas production, oil production, measuring stations and substations, converters and compression platforms. In relation to the Baltic Sea tourism infrastructure projects and wind farms are mentioned. The main features impacted by physical loss are listed. No trends or conclusive judgements on the level of pressure or its impacts in relation to GES have been reported, as Germany indicates that the data are insufficient and that recognized methods are still missing to do so (although GES is defined by Germany for seabed habitats protected/listed under international agreements).

In relation to physical damage, in the reporting sheets Germany only listed the main causes of pressure - fisheries and sand and gravel mining – and the main features impacted. In the paper report, trawling fisheries are referred to as the main cause of abrasion of the seabed, while the different types of selective extraction of materials (sand, gravel, stone, oil and gas) is related to changes in siltation. The impacts of physical damage are briefly referred to as are some specific projects causing the pressure. There is an attempt to quantify some parameters and a worthy amount of literature is cited. No trends or conclusive judgements on the level of pressure or its impacts have been reported.

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
The initial assessment carried out Germany on the habitats in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea covers practically only seabed habitats. Germany acknowledges that while there is good information on areas near the coast there is only little knowledge about other areas. In addition, Germany recognizes that the existing monitoring does not match the requirements of the MSFD and therefore not all assessment areas could be fully monitored for all features and characteristics, indicating that multi-scale spatial models, which consider various pressures and biotope types, can be a good approach for future assessments.

Germany has reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. For both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, the following predominant habitats were listed: Shallow Sublittoral Coarse Sediment, Shallow Sublittoral Sand, Shallow Sublittoral Mud, Shallow Sublittoral Mixed Sediment, Shelf Sublittoral Coarse Sediment, Shelf Sublittoral Mud and Shelf Sublittoral Mixed Sediment. In addition, for the Baltic Sea Germany mentioned Reduced Salinity Water and Variable Salinity (estuarine) Water habitats. For predominant habitats the assessment includes descriptions of habitat distribution, extent and condition are always provided. For some habitat types, the localisation and quantification of extent and distribution, as well as the main pressures affecting each habitat are also covered. However, no trends are or definitive judgements are provided.

Germany has also reported on special habitats. For the North Sea these come from the OSPAR Convention – seagrass beds, macrophytobenthos, mussel beds, seapens and burrowing megafauna, Sabellaria reefs and species-rich coarse sand, gravel and maerl areas. For the Baltic Sea, the following special habitats were reported: seagrass beds, macrophytobenthos, mussel beds, species-rich coarse sand, gravel and maerl areas, offshore deep-water below the halocline, gravel seabed with Ophelia and maerl. In relation to special habitat the assessment covers the description of habitat distribution, extent and condition with a certain level of quantification as well as distribution range and the main pressures affecting each habitat. In addition, the status in relation to natural conditions is provided (altered for most habitats). These judgements were based on experts assessment and WFD orientation and used as baseline the historical stocks and spreads of some species (mussels).";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures:
The initial assessment by Germany of physical loss and damage is considered partially adequate. The different types and causes of physical loss and damage are well documented and reported. However, the information on impacts is less comprehensive – the habitats impacted are listed but there is no mention to what they are subject to. In addition, there are no judgements on the current status or any information on the plans to gather data that will allow making these judgements in the future. Germany could have placed the pressures in context along the coastline, and possibly also pointed out if there are pressure-free areas (MPAs etc.). Germany.

Features:
The initial assessment by Germany of biological features is considered partially adequate. Not all habitat types and species groups are covered, and there is not enough information on the relevant pressures. In addition, there is no information on ecosystems even if it is likely that some information exists that would have allowed some assessment. Many of the components missing above could be assessed together and thus make a start towards ecosystems assessment. The information reported is mostly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Judgements on status were provided in some cases. Reference is made to existing international conservation agreements and to the Habitats Directive but the justification of reporting under the Habitats Directive timeframe is only relevant for protected/listed species. There is still an important gaps with regard to other species groups. Germany states an ambition to address the knowledge gaps before 2018.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Germany has set one overall target UZ3 on “Seas without damage to marine species or habitats due to impacts from human activities” and four sub-targets for biodiversity which apply to all three biodiversity Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 along, with various associated indicators. 

The sub-targets address ‘no-take’ zones and times, improvements in fishing gear selectivity, protection of migratory pathways of diadromous species, regeneration and restoration of damaged ecosystem components and non-indigenous species (NIS). The sub-target on NIS is assessed under Section 4 on D2. The sub-targets are mostly pressure targets, which is consistent with the general heading of Target UZ3. They do not cover the criteria/indicators of the Commission Decision systematically. They are only specific for a certain pressures (e.g. by-catch) or parameters (e.g. resting areas). They refer to functional groups in the context of foodwebs and migratory species and to protected/listed species but there is no systematic and consistent coverage of all ecosystem components. Habitats are mentioned only through the reference to foodwebs. The targets can be considered to cover partially D1 and D4 but they do not cover D6 on seafloor integrity (apart from the indicator on fishing techniques which could impact the seafloor). 

While the indicators are potentially measurable, they are not further specified through threshold values and baselines, which means that they cannot be used to assess the achievement of the sub-target. Consequently, the sub-targets lack the attributes that would make them SMART (e.g. threshold values and baselines). 

No mention is made of the operational targets/objectives of the various EU/regional/international agreements and mechanisms used to define GES. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The targets as defined by Germany are considered partially adequate. The targets as a set do not fully address the three biodiversity descriptors and lack attributes that make them SMART, although they are potentially measurable. Since the GES definition relies on existing policies and convention commitments it could have been expected that the targets from these mechanisms would have been referred to under Article 10.  ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

- Cover a number of species and functional groups but mostly listed/protected ones
- Cover D1 and D4 but not really D6

";2;Partially adequate
Germany (North East Atlantic);D6;Consistency ;;"Germany has stated that GES for biodiversity can currently not be defined due to a lack of standards. A GES definition has been provided, which is not structured using the Commission Decision but instead relies on existing legislation and commitments to define the GES for Descriptor 1, 4 and 6. The GES definition is the same for all three biodiversity descriptors but has been adjusted for the North Sea and Baltic sub-region to refer to the correct policy instruments in those regions.  There is no conclusive clarification provided on how these pieces of legislation and commitments cover the MSFD. 

The fact that the initial assessment mentions that existing monitoring does not match the requirements of the MSFD suggests that the German approach likely does not fully cover all the MSFD requirements. Furthermore the targets as provided for in Article 10 do not apply or directly rely on targets from existing pieces of legislation and commitments. There is therefore no consistency in the approach used for setting the GES definition and the targets. In general the biodiversity targets set in Article 10 do not correspond to the GES definition. Overall both the GES definitions and the targets imply a lack of ambition to move beyond existing legislation and commitments. The GES definition and targets also lack clear baselines and thresholds although some are implicit in the legislation and guidelines that are part of the GES definition. ";;;;
Germany (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor and criteria levels. The definition is not a mere reproduction of the definition of the MSFD but it is not consistent in the reporting sheets and in the paper report – the GES definition in the reporting sheets is much more detailed than in the paper report but contains what is considered to be accompanying text (which has not been reproduced here – see cross cutting section). Germany’s definitions for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are identical, although it should be noted that the Wadden Sea is object of a specific mention in the accompanying text to the GES definition of the North Sea, and therefore, has been analysed in conjunction. All criteria laid out for Descriptor 10 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated in the GES defintion. 

The definition takes into account time and scale changes (if permanent changes, only local consequences). It also takes into consideration cumulative impacts and identifies potentially impaired ecosystems and populations. The GES definition is consistent with to the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters but does not include any mention to the OSPAR or HELCOM approaches. There are no aggregation rules or reference to specific approaches or tools (e.g. SEA, EIA, and MSP) as support to the assessment of impact.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany indicates that hydrological and hydrographical analyses of its marine waters are carried out by federal and State authorities but recognizes that there is no agreed assessment procedure. It is stated that in order to identify gaps and adopt quantitative indicators and threshold monitoring programmes (2014) and action plans (2015) will be put in place. The initial assessment of permanent hydrographical alterations is therefore mainly qualitative and there is no reference to the proportion of the environment affected or to trends and the current status of the waters. The information reported is very similar for both marine regions – the North Sea and the Baltic Sea – apart from the mention to some specific projects causing the pressure.

Changes in the temperature profile are attributed to the numerous routes of underground power cables and to cooling water discharged from power plants. Changes in the salinity regime are also reported to occur in the transitional and coastal waters. The impact of permanent hydrographical alterations in water column and seabed habitats is described in very general terms, indicating that the overall effects are small if compared with other pressures and occur mainly at local level. It is also reported that the impact on functional groups has still not been adequately studied.

Germany has also reported on marine acidification, however, it is recognized that there is not enough data available and therefore the assessment is not very detailed. Industry, agriculture, forestry and urban discharges are listed as the main causes of pressure, which reportedly affects 25-50% of the water column habitats (there is no assessment of seabed habitats). No status or trend assessment are reported but it is mentioned that the recording of the pH values carried out in the German Bight  (North Sea) in the winters of 1990 to 2010 and between Luebeck and Helsinki (Baltic Sea) since 2003 shows no significant changes in the acidification of marine waters.";The initial assessment of Germany for permanent hydrographical alterations is assessed as partially adequate.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined three targets and several associated parameters to address Descriptor 7 both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report.  The first target is different for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The other two targets are common to both regions. The first target for the North Sea addresses specifically the intertidal zone of the Wadden Sea. The first target for the Baltic Sea addresses cumulative effects of physical interventions (with a list of human activities) and overlaps with the second target, which is common to both regions, as it also addresses impacts on marine ecosystems. Germany has also indicated that targets addressing D3 and D11 will also contribute to tackling some of the pressures reported under D7, however these targets are analysed in those chapters.

Only qualitative targets have been established. They cannot be considered as SMART as only very general orientations are given about the way these targets could be assessed (“measurement, modelling charting”). In addition, no time reference is given. Although the main potential impacts on the ecosystem to be controlled are addressed (“habitats functions”, “decline of population”), no target is provided for specific levels of pressures or human activities in order to actually control them. Germany does not provide indicators but rather lists of parameters that should be assessed. These parameters however are not associated with any threshold values. 

No direct reference is made in the targets to compliance with existing regulatory regimes (e.g. EIAs) or to the WFD normative definitions for coastal waters. In the accompanying text in the paper report, Germany mentions compliance with the WFD, the RSCs and the CBD as well as the necessity for EIAs to take into account local impacts and cumulative effects. Germany mentions that the objective is mainly to ‘maintain a natural state’. It seems to indicate that Germany considers that it is already in a ‘natural state’ and the role of the targets is to maintain such state by targeting physical interventions (again it is not clear whether only new interventions are addressed by the targets). 

No indication is provided about spatial scale in the targets but in the accompanying text to the targets, Germany refers to the findings of the initial assessment that most changes are small and localised and mentions that most interventions take place on the coast.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Germany for D7 is assessed as inadequate. The targets are merely qualitative and therefore they cannot be measured. The main potential impacts are addressed but not the main pressures. As they stand, it cannot be considered that these targets are sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact, or controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved.

In addition, there is no judgement on the current status per reference to GES. 

Although the initial assessment does not have a lot of information on impacts, the environmental targets focus on impacts and not on pressures. The current set of targets is not considered to be specific enough; the list of indicators is in reality a mere list of parameters to which the targets do not clearly relate to. It is considered that only if the targets are quantified can GES be achieved.";;;;
Germany (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor and criteria levels in the paper report (covering concentration and effects of contaminants) and at descriptor and indicator levels in the reporting sheets. The main difference between the definition in the paper report and in the reporting sheets is the inclusion in the latter of specific definitions for indicators 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 on effects of contaminants (in the paper report, this text is actually part of the accompanying text to the GES definition). 

Germany does not provide an exact list of the substances covered by its GES definition but it quotes the Commission Decision, which refers to the substances in Annex X of the WFD and the priority substances of the EQS Directive (including revisions). In addition, Germany mentions substances that are relevant for river basins, sediment-related contaminants listed in Annexes VIII, IX and X of the WFD and the substances, relevant for sediment, which due to their chemical properties are mainly particle-bound. Considering that Germany also refers to OSPAR’s EACs, it would seem logical to include the substances covered by the EACs in the list of contaminants considered by Germany, although it is not clearly expressed by Germany. If this is the case, a number of additional substances, not included in the list of priority substances, will be considered by Germany. These include specific congeners for PCB (CB28, 52, 101, 105, 118, 138, 153, 156 and 180) and for PAHs (phenanthrene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene and chrysene). Although radionuclides are not included in these various lists, Germany notes in the reporting sheet that these are covered by its GES definition. 

Concentration of contaminants
The approach chosen by Germany for the measurement of concentrations of contaminants is a combination of the EQS, OSPAR’s EAC and the ERLs defined by the American Environmental Protection Agency for sediment quality mostly (and the EU foodstuffs Regulation on which will be assessed in D9). In the accompanying text, Germany considers that neither the EQS nor the EAC/ERL approach is sufficient to meet the requirements of the MSFD on its own. In the definition, Germany specifies that contaminants should be measured in their relevant matrix, which implies that alternatively the EQS or the EAC/ERL should be applied, depending on whether measurements should be done in the water or, because of low water solubility, in sediment or biota. Germany does not provide the details of which species will be used for measurements in biota but by reference to the OSPAR Agreement 2009-2 on CEMP Assessment Criteria for the QSR 2010, it can be inferred that mussels, oysters and fish will be used. 

In its definition, Germany refers to the precautionary principle because of the uncertainties that exist in the combined use of the EQS and the EAC/ERL. One such uncertainty relates to the potential conflict between the three substances for which the EQSD can be applied in biota (“prey tissue”); i.e. Hg, HCB, hexachlorobutadiene (cf. EQSD art.3§2.a). Germany does not provide indication of what it will do in this case. 

In terms of threshold values, Germany simply refers to its own legislation which implements the EQS, to the WFD and the EQSD and to the OSPAR Agreement 2009-2. Germany also specifies the standards to be applied to the Wadden Sea from the TMAP. It seems that the same approach (combining the EQS and EAC/ERL) has been used for the Wadden Sea as for the rest of the German marine waters.  In terms of baselines, Germany refers to the OSPAR’s background values (BACs). It should be recalled that, unlike the EQS and EAC, the BACs are not risk-based.

Germany acknowledges that, while the EQS as defined in the EQS Directive can be applied to coastal and transitional waters, there is uncertainty as to their relevance for offshore waters and that development is still needed in order to apply the EQS to offshore waters. In the reporting sheet, Germany states that, even if a number of parameters are already operational (e.g. the EQS/EAC for which there is no conflict/uncertainty), its GES definition as a whole is still to be considered under development and is expected to be operational in 2018, following the completion of the monitoring programme and programme of measures. No indication is provided on the aggregation rules to be used in order to determine whether an area is at GES or not.

Effects of contaminants
With regard to effects of contaminants, Germany refers to the recommendations from OSPAR JAMP/CEMP and ICES in relation to the biological effects of contaminants but only mentions these standards as “possible basis” for the definition of GES. These include OSPAR’s EAC/ERL, which unlike the EQS are developed in an integrated manner taking into account contaminants’ concentrations and their biological effects. The accompanying text also mentions OSPAR’s ecological quality objectives (EcoQOs) related to hazardous substances and oil (imposex in gastropods, mercury and organochlorines in birds’ eggs and the oil-related mortality rate in birds). In addition to biological effects, Germany mentions that the number and extent of oil-contaminated areas could also be taken into account but again only as a “possible basis”. ";The definition of GES for D8 by Germany is considered partially adequate. Germany has defined GES for the two criteria of the Commission Decision (concentrations and effects of contaminants), using at least the minimum requirements (EQS) and complementing with the use of OSPAR’s recommended environmental assessment criteria and environmental quality objectives. There are a number of uncertainties related to the potential conflicts/overlaps/gaps in the use of both EQS and EAC/ERL and Germany mentions the application of the precautionary principle because of these uncertainties.  It should be noted that while OSPAR’s EAC are risk-based (similarly to the EU EQS) and more tailored to marine water assessments than the EQS, the EU requires that OSPAR's EAC provide an equivalent protection to that theoretically provided by the EQSD.  Finally, the introduction of the terms “possible basis” creates uncertainty as to the level of commitment by Germany with regard to its GES definition. ;"- GES defined for the two criteria of the Decision
- Application of the EQS and complementing with EAC
- No explanation of potential conflict between the two methods but mention the precautionary principle
- Addition of term “possible basis” creates uncertainty";2;Partially adequate
Germany (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany reports to a similar level of details for the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions, using the same methodology to make an assessment of the current levels of and impacts from the contamination pressure. The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Germany provides a detailed description of the main sources of contamination by man-made substances. The assessment considers polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs), chlorinated compounds (including PCBs, DDT group, HCHs), brominated (e.g. PBDEs), fluorinated (e.g. PFCs such as PFOS) and polar nitrogen and phosphorus-containing compounds. The main sources of contamination by man-made substances are industrial production (via rivers), atmospheric deposition or point sources (e.g. offshore activities or the disposal of dredged material). The description however is mostly qualitative. Germany does not provide a quantitative estimate of the inputs of contaminants from these various sources and provides qualitative trends for PAHs in the North Sea (stable) and POPs in the Baltic (decreasing) and quantitative trends for lindane in the Baltic (80% decline between 1999 and 2009). In the background report to the initial assessment however, Germany provides a table with quantitative inputs of different POP substances up to 2009. In the Baltic Sea, Germany makes a spatial assessment of concentration levels (e.g. highest concentrations of PAHs are found in the Kiel and Flensburg Fjord) and refers to seasonal trends. 

Germany provides a number of qualitative trends for the levels of concentrations in a number of species (e.g. decreasing trends for all selected substances in mussel samples from the North Frisian coast; rising trends for PCBs in mussels at the Darsser location in the Baltic since 2000). Germany has estimated that 75-100% of the Baltic Sea assessment area and 50-75% of the North Sea assessment area is affected by contamination by man-made substances. No assessment has been made of impacts of contaminants on seabed habitats. However, in the reporting sheet, Germany states that 5-25% of seabed habitats are impacted by contamination in both regions. It is not certain where this assessment comes from. With regard to functional groups, Germany makes an assessment of the effects of organotin compounds (mainly TBT) from antifouling paints for ships and other underwater installations on a number of species (Nordic purple snail, Nucella lapillus, beach snail, Littorina littorea, and mud snail, Hydrobia ulvae, mussels), which have led to a decrease of the affected species in highly polluted regions. Germany also mentions the assessment carried out of the health status of fish, on the basis of the results of OSPAR CEMP and using the Fish Disease Index (FDI) for the North Sea, for a number of target species (dab, Plattfischart, flounder, cod and whiting). The results of the assessment are not provided in the reporting sheet but a graph showing the evolution over time of the FDI (between the BAC and the EAC) is provided in the paper report. Additional information is provided on biological effects on marine species at the top of the food web in the paper report. 

With regard to non-synthetic substances, Germany provides quantitative trends for riverine input of mercury and cadmium into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Overall, inputs have declined (North Sea: 12% decline for mercury and 38% decline for cadmium in comparison to 1990; Baltic Sea: 10% decline in mercury in comparison to 1994). In the paper report, Germany provides graphs showing temporal trends from 1990 to 2008 for riverine inputs of Cd, Hg, Cu, Pb and Zn. Other sources (shipping, oil and gas, industry, urban wastewater, etc.) are considered in more detailed in the background report to the initial assessment, with graphs illustrating decreasing trends for all substances from all sources between 1983 and 2005. Germany assesses that 50-75% of the North Sea waters and 25-50% of sediment is affected by contamination by non-synthetic substances. While contamination is increasing in the water, it is said to be decreasing in sediments. It is not certain how Germany has made this assessment. 

In terms of the current level of contamination in the environment, Germany has not made an aggregated judgement but provides a large number of judgements for different contaminants (man-made and natural) measured in different matrices (all three matrices are covered). This is consistent with the fact that Germany has not yet defined aggregation rules that would allow to determine whether an area is at GES or not. For the moment therefore, Germany only provides indications of where concentrations of certain contaminants in certain matrices are considered acceptable or not (e.g. in the North Sea PAH exposure is not acceptable in 55% of all sampling stations). The only judgement made is for pesticides and biocide in biota, which levels are considered acceptable (i.e. status is good). 

The judgements on the levels of contamination by heavy metals are slightly more aggregated than for man-made substances. Germany judges that the current level of contamination in water is acceptable (i.e. status is good) and not acceptable in sediment and biota (i.e. status is not good) for both marine regions. For the North Sea, the thresholds and baselines used to make the various judgements on the acceptability of concentration levels are those defined for GES (EQS and EAC). For the Baltic Sea, the threshold values and baselines used are also the EQS and OSPAR’s EAC/BAC. Germany states that assessment criteria from HELCOM are not yet available but does not provide an indication of its plans to address this gap. For heavy metals, it is quite unclear how Germany has combined measurements using both the EQS and the EAC to achieve aggregated judgements on the current levels of contamination.

Overall Germany concludes, on the basis of 2010 OSPAR QSR, that there are “many problems” in relation to levels of contamination in the OSPAR Region II (North Sea) and that the current status of the Baltic coastal waters is “moderate” to “bad”. It is not certain what this judgement for the Baltic is based on. Germany also mentions that at the time of the first WFD management plans, which used national standards rather than the EQS (which were not yet in place at that time), almost all coastal waters of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea were found to be in good chemical status. No judgement is made on the level of impacts on ecosystem components (seabed habitats or functional groups). 

Germany does not provide any information on data gaps and for the North Sea only mentions the work currently done in the framework of OSPAR to develop further environmental assessment criteria. 

Radionuclides
Germany has made an assessment of contamination by radionuclides, describing, for the North Sea, the various sources of contamination: land- and air-based (nuclear power plants in operation – Brokdorf, Emsland, Count, Grohnde, Neckarwestheim 2 and Phillipsburg 2 – and being dismantled – Lingen, Mülheim-Kärlich Obrigheim Rheinberg, Stade and Würgassen) and sea-based (discharges of natural radionuclides from gas platform (Pb-210, Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228)). In the background documents of the initial assessment, Germany provides a number of graphs of inputs of radioactive substances from different substances over time (up to 2009). For the Baltic, Germany mentions that the greatest source of anthropogenic inputs of radionuclides comes from Chernobyl accident. Germany assesses that according to current knowledge, discharges from nuclear plants and from the gas platform are so low that the proportion of introduced into the North and Baltic seas by radioactive materials is negligible and concentrations cannot be detected. No assessment is made of impacts specifically from radionuclides on ecosystem components. No judgement is made on the current levels of and impacts from contamination by radionuclides. For the Baltic Sea, Germany refers to the HELCOM thematic assessment on “Radioactivity in the Baltic Sea, 1999-2006”.  

In terms of knowledge gaps, Germany mentions that to date there is a gap in the development of assessment criteria for radionuclides (threshold values and baselines).

Acute pollution events
While limited information is presented in the reporting sheet on contamination by acute pollution events, the paper report contains a short description of the number of oil spills and the regulations in place within MARPOL. It also describes the release of other types of substances into the marine environment. Germany mentions that in recent years, no major accidents have occurred but acknowledges that there are gaps in knowledge/data (without specifying which exactly). In terms of future plans, Germany mentions in the reporting sheets the need for a detailed gap analysis, the development of indicators and the quantification of reference and threshold values following the implementation of the monitoring programme in 2014 and the programme of measures in 2015. ";The initial assessment of contamination of the North Sea and Baltic Sea by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered adequate. Germany provides a detailed description of the sources and contaminants concerned and, despite the lack of quantification of input loads, provides indicative trends. It assesses some of the impacts on ecosystem components but does not cover seabed habitats. It refers to RSC existing assessments (OSPAR QSR and HELCOM assessments). It makes a number of judgements on the levels of contamination in reference to the EQS and OSPAR’s EAC. ;"- Detailed description of sources of contamination and indicative trends of input loads
- Assessment of impacts on functional groups but not seabed habitats
- Judgements on the level of contamination in reference to EQS and EAC (but not aggregated)";3;Adequate
Germany (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Germany has defined five sub-targets related to contamination by hazardous substances under the general heading of Target UZ2 “Seas without contamination by pollutants” for both marine regions. Germany has mentioned that Target UZ5 on “Seas without exposure to litter” is also relevant for D8. While this is duly noted in the context of this analysis, the assessment of Target UZ5 is done in the section on D10. The sub-targets on contamination by hazardous substances cover the criteria and indicators (to a certain extent) of the Commission Decision and are strongly related to the GES for D8 defined by Germany. 

Germany addresses the various sources of contamination (riverine inputs, atmospheric deposition, sea-based contamination) and addresses the specific issue of oil and oil products. The targets themselves are quite general, using terms such as “further reduced” and “avoided”. In a few cases, the indicator(s) associated with the target is associated with a threshold value and a baseline. This is the case for sub-targets 1 and 5, for which it is specified, in the reporting sheets, that the threshold values are those set under national surface water regulations, the WFD, the EQSD and the OSPAR 2009-2 agreement for the North Sea / assessment procedures used by HELCOM for the Baltic Sea (and the TMAP for the Wadden Sea). It is also mentioned that limit values for sediment and biota still need to be developed. It is unclear why the limit values defined for sediment and biota at EU and RSC levels (EQS and EAC/ERL) are not used for these targets. 

These two sub-targets on concentrations of contaminants are not pressure-targets. They are potentially measurable but lack specificity regarding the substances covered and the approach to be prioritised. They are actually rather reformulation of GES than targets to help achieve GES. Sub-target 5 also addresses pollution effects and is associated with an indicator on biological effects of contaminants according to ICES/OSPAR for the North Sea and ICES/HELCOM CORESET for the Baltic. In the reporting sheet, Germany specifies that the standard to be used for this target is the OSPAR assessment criteria for TBT (imposex EcoQO) for the North Sea and the “assessment procedures used by HELCOM” for the Baltic, which is rather unspecific. No mention is made of the other OSPAR EcoQOs related to contaminants. 

Sub-target 2 and 3 also relate to concentrations of contaminants but focus on pressures from sea-based activities (shipping and oil&gas). The first one, focusing on atmospheric contamination, is not specified by an indicator and/or threshold values or an indication of the activities targeted. It is generic and not measurable because not associated with specific reference levels. Sub-target 3 is more specific, referring to oil&gas activities and shipping and to the MARPOL convention for the inputs from shipping. It mentions that the MARPOL convention should be revised but does not propose different threshold values for inputs from ships. None of the indicators associated with sub-targets 2 and 3 are further specified with threshold values or baselines. Germany acknowledges that further work is needed for these sub-targets in order to make them operational. Such work should be done in coordination with neighbouring countries. In addition, sector-specific targets could be defined after the design of the programme of measure in 2015.

For sub-target 4 on the reduction of input of oil and oil products, whether legal, illegal or accidental, no threshold values is defined but Germany refers to the MARPOL convention and the standards agreed in this framework. As for other contaminants, it mentions that MARPOL should be revised to achieve a further decrease of inputs of contaminants but does not provide different threshold values for its target. While an indicator is added on the oiled birds, it is not further specified with a threshold or reference value. OSPAR’s EcoQO on oiled guillemots is not mentioned.  

In the accompanying text to the targets, Germany mentions the links between the objectives of D8 and other descriptors (in particular D9, 1, 3, 4 and 6). It also mentions the link with MPAs and the CBD and the need for regional cooperation to tackle transboundary pollution.  ";The set of targets defined by Germany to cover D8 is considered partially adequate. The targets cover all the elements of the GES definition (and of the Commission Decision) but they are not all specific. The targets that are specific (sub-targets 1 and 5) are rather expressions of GES (using exactly the same threshold and reference values) than actual targets to help achieve GES (e.g. by targeting a pressure). The pressure targets on shipping are more specific because related to MARPOL standards but Germany acknowledges that MARPOL should be revised without proposing different standards for its targets. Considering their lack of specificity, it is not clear whether these targets are sufficient to achieve GES by 2020.;"- Address the various sources of contaminations
- Many pressure targets
- Some quantification of indicators (threshold values) but not systematically
- Reference to MARPOL but lack of ambition";2;Partially adequate
Germany (North East Atlantic);D8;Consistency ;;"The initial assessment of pressures and impacts from contamination is relatively consistent with the definition of GES. However, Germany does not address other biological effects than imposex in the initial assessment whereas more are included in the GES definition. For the Baltic Sea, Germany uses OSPAR standards to make a judgement on current status, mentioning that HELCOM standards are not yet developed, but the GES definition is based on HELCOM standards. 

The setting of environment targets is also consistent with the initial assessment of pressure and impacts considering that the targets are quite general. The targets use the same standards as the GES definition except that MARPOL, mentioned in the targets and the initial assessment, is not mentioned in the GES definition. In addition, as for the initial assessment, other biological effects than imposex (e.g. covered by other OSPAR EcoQOs) are not covered by the environmental targets, leaving uncertainty with regard to whether GES for all biological effects will be achieved by 2020. For the Baltic Sea, the target on biological effects of contaminants refers to HELCOM CORESET which is not mentioned in the GES or the initial assessment. ";;;;
Germany (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Germany has defined GES for D9 at descriptor level in the paper report and the reporting sheets. The GES definition is the same for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Germany does not mention the Commission Decision criterion and indicators. 

The definition refers to EU maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs. In the accompanying text, Germany refers to Regulation 1881/2006 (but does not mention its amendments 835/2011 and 1259/2011). Germany also refers to Directive 2006/113/EC on the quality of shellfish waters and to a national 1991 regulation on pesticide. No mention is made of the substances monitored but it is inferred that these are the substances covered by Regulation 1881/2006. No mention is made of other substances of relevance in fish and other seafood. Germany does not provide any details on the foodstuffs that will be monitored suggesting again that it will use those laid out in the Regulation, without further specification of foodstuffs particularly relevant for Germany. No aggregation rule is defined and no criterion is provided in case concentrations exceed regulatory levels. 

Germany mentions the links between D9 and D8 and in particular that achieving D8 will help achievement of D9 (but not necessarily the other way round as food monitoring and environmental monitoring have different requirements). Germany points out the difficulties to trace the origin of the sampled fish and seafood but does not mention any plans to address this issue. ";The GES definition for D9 for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea is considered partially adequate. The definition refers to the relevant EU Regulation (1881/2006) but does not mention its amendments. It does however refer to Directive 2006/113/EC thereby including microbial pathogens in the scope of the GES definition, which is considered a good practice. No plan is proposed to address the issue of traceability of the fish and seafood samples.

Germany (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Germany reports to a similar level of details for the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions. The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
In the reporting sheets, Germany only provides a very limited description of the fish and seafood market, risks to human health and the need to comply with EU Regulation 1881/2006. In addition, in the paper report, Germany provides a quantitative assessment of current levels of concentrations of a number of substances (dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in cod liver, and methylmercury in cod). More information related to the health status of fish (using the Fish Disease Index) has been reported by Germany and integrated in the assessment under D8 however. 

Germany justifies this limited assessment by stating that data from regular food monitoring is not part of the initial assessment for the MSFD. It does not provide any indication of possible changes to this situation or plans to address data and assessment gaps. 

Germany does not make an aggregated judgement on the current levels of concentrations in relation to regulatory levels. In the reporting sheets, it seems that Germany integrates the EU limit values for foodstuffs in its assessment of levels of non-synthetic substances in biota (fish).  In any case it is rather unclear and there is no detail of the fish species and the substances measured. It is also not clear how these results based on Regulation 1881/2006 (if that is the case) have been combined with other measurements of non-synthetic substances in biota (mussels and fish), based on EQS and EAC thresholds, to achieve a judgement that current levels are not acceptable (i.e. status is not good). 

Radionuclides
No separate assessment has been made of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption by radionuclides.

Microbial pathogens
Germany has made an initial assessment on microbial pathogens in the reporting sheets and in the paper report. Impacts from microbial pathogens have been assessed, for bathing water and shellfish waters. There is no actual judgement on the status is given, but it is stated that the status is ‘according to shellfish water directive’.  The trend of pressure is considered a stable. The main cause for pressure has not been given. ";The initial assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances and by microbial pathogens made by Germany is considered partially adequate. Germany provides limited information on contamination of fish and seafood. It only makes an assessment of current levels of concentrations for a limited number of substances in cod and cod liver and does not make a judgement in relation to Regulation 1881/2006. It does not describe data gaps but justifies its limited reporting by stating that food monitoring is not in the scope of the MSFD. It does not provide plans to address this gap. ;"- Limited information provided on contamination of fish and seafood (but includes assessment of microbial pathogens)

Germany (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"D9 is covered by the target UZ2 “Seas without contamination by pollutants”, which has already been assessed under D8 (which is why all the indicators are not reported again in this section). 

The links between D9 and D8 are described in detail with a mention that achieving the objectives of D8 should help achieve the objectives of D9 considering that D8 standards are stricter. In addition, Germany has specified one indicator on contaminant levels in seafood according to EU limits. Germany specifies in the reporting sheets that the threshold values for this indicator are those set in Regulation 1881/2006, Directive 2006/113/EC and the 1991 national regulation on pesticides. The indicator is very similar to the GES definition. ";The set of targets and indicators on contaminants defined by Germany is considered partially adequate to cover D9. Only one indicator specifically addresses D9 and it is rather an expression of GES than part of an operational target that would help achieve GES (e.g. by focusing on relevant species for human consumption or by using trends rather than compliance to regulatory levels as indicators of change) but it is specific and measurable. ;"- Only one target specific to D9, the others are targets on contamination of the marine environment by hazardous substances (D8)

Germany (North East Atlantic);D9;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the current pressure from contamination on fish and seafood is not consistent with the definition of GES and the setting of targets. It refers only to the Fish Disease Index (FDI), which is not an indicator for human consumption, and to concentration levels of certain substances in cod and cod liver. Neither these substances nor cod are referred to in the GES or the targets. 

The assessment of microbial pathogens and the reference to the Shellfish Water Directive in the initial assessment is consistent with the inclusion of the Shellfish Water Directive as a standard in the GES definition.  

The set of targets and indicator that are said to cover D9 are consistent with the GES definition as they both refer to compliance with EU standards. ";;;;
Greece;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. However the definition at descriptor level incorporates most of the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision. Criterion 1.7 is partially addressed by the first criterion on basic ecosystems.  

The definition consists of two parts. The first is defined at a high level and is very general. It provides a list of five criteria for the achievement of GES. These cover the distribution, abundance and condition of species and the distribution, extent and condition of habitats. To achieve GES, these various criteria must “reflect prevailing conditions” or not be “significantly reduced” or be “likely to exist” in the predicable future. None of these criteria are specific, and no threshold values are defined. 

The first criterion states that there should be no further degradation in biodiversity and that where possible, it should be restored. Prevailing conditions are used as reference conditions only for the second criterion, but the GES definition does reflect the use of ‘reference conditions plus acceptable deviation’ (taking into account the sustainable use of the marine environment). The baseline for the third criterion is not specified, which means that it is not clear what “not significantly reduced” relates to. 

The fourth criterion of the first part of the GES definition relates to protected/listed species and refers to national, regional and international treaties and mechanisms in place for their protection. It does not provide any further detail regarding which agreements are covered by this criterion. 

The last criterion relates to the reduction of pressures on the habitats and species from human activities but again, there is a lack of detail regarding what is meant with “do not cause significant degradation”. It is also not specified which activities are targeted by the GES definition, so presumably all activities causing pressures on species and habitats are covered.

While the first part of the GES definition is general and not specific with regard to the species groups and habitats types that are addressed by GES (and, presumably, addresses all relevant species and habitats for Greek marine waters in the same way), Greece has proposed a second set of criteria to cover Descriptor 1 which, for some of them, are much more specific. In particular, these criteria address two specific species (the Mediterranean monk seal and the loggerhead sea turtle) and three habitat types (Posidonia oceanica, maerl-type sediments and other coralligenous habitats). They also cover benthic macrofauna communities and planktonic communities. Overall, these GES criteria cover marine mammals and reptiles (through on representative species for each group) and both seabed (seagrass, biogenic habitats and benthic macrofaunal communities) and water column (plankton communities) habitats. 

While these criteria are more specific in regard to the features addressed, they still lack details to make them measurable. No baseline or thresholds are mentioned that would enable the specification of what is meant by “significant reduction”. It should be noted that the wording of the first two criteria is different in the paper report, which uses terms such as “conservation of […]” rather than “no significant reduction in”, hence allowing more flexibility in the reporting sheets’ definition. Nevertheless, overall the inconsistency is considered to be relatively minor. The sixth criterion, on benthic macrofauna communities, refers to environmental quality criteria. It is not clear what these are. 

No reference is made to the Favourable Conservation Status of the Habitats Directive or to the Good Ecological Status of the WFD but they may be reflected in the various criteria. No reference is made to other regional or international agreements. ";The GES definition for Descriptor 1 is considered to be partially adequate when both parts of the definition are considered together. While the second part of the definition provides some specification of species and habitats that are presumably quite common, and therefore representative of Greek marine waters, this would not be sufficient on its own. However the first part of the definition, which is more general, means that GES should be covering all elements (i.e. all relevant habitats and species). It also means that all criteria of the Commission Decision are covered. However, neither of the two parts of the GES definition is quantified, which means that it is not possible to assess whether GES is achieved. ;"- Definition in two parts, which would be inadequate if assessed separately but partially adequate when taken together

Greece;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features

Species/functional groups
In the reporting sheets Greece has reported on the following species/functional groups, although not always for all three marine sub-regions: inshore pelagic-feeding birds, seals, baleen whales, toothed whales and turtles. In addition, Greece reported on a few individual species, including some listed species. Greece reports the need to have more detailed research and monitoring in relation to some specific parameters but where the information is available, Greece has reported a qualitative judgement on the current status. Thus, in all the three sub-regions and in relation to species groups, e.g. seals and turtles are considered as not presenting any decrease on both group condition and abundance. The same conclusion is presented for some individual species like, e.g. Caretta caretta and Delphinus delphis. The relevant pressures impacting the group or species are also listed – litter and the selective extraction of fish and shellfish are those more recurrently mentioned. 

In the paper report, the information, which is more developed than in the reporting sheets, focused on cetaceans, sea turtles, seals Monachus monachus, inshore pelagic-feeding birds and fish (although it is indicated that additional information on fish stocks is found in the section of the report on fisheries). The information is mainly qualitative and consisting of numerous references to the existing literature. The main species of each group are listed and the distribution of the group and the main threats are briefly described.

Habitats
Greece has carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the three marine sub-regions. The information is usually general, consisting of numerous references to existing literature. The assessment is mainly qualitative. Greece acknowledges gaps in the knowledge on the level of disturbance and the percentage of habitats impacted, and states that additional information will be gathered in the framework of the monitoring obligations under the Water Framework Directive.

The information reported focuses on benthic habitats as it is indicated that issues related to pelagic ecosystems are connected with eutrophication and therefore addressed in that section of the report. The main predominant habitats – shallow sublittoral sand, mixed and coarse sediment and mud, shelf sublittoral mud, mixed and coarse sediment and sand – are listed and briefly described (in the paper report) and the main pressures identified (including physical loss and damage, nutrient enrichment, introduction of hazardous substances). Posidonia oceanica meadows are reported as a special habitat in the Adriatic Sea and in the Ionian Sea, together with a descriptive judgement on their current status and trend (declining). The paper report besides addressing the Posidonia oceanica meadows provides information also on biogenic of Maerl type. There are no references to the Habitats Directive or to the relevant regional sea convention. 

Ecosystems
Greece has addressed two ecosystems both in the reporting sheet and in the paper report – the pelagic ecosystem and the benthic ecosystem. The information is very limited and includes a brief description of the current status, which is mostly based on the existing literature, and a list of the main pressures affecting the ecosystems (selective extraction of species and nutrient enrichment for the pelagic ecosystem and physical loss and damage and nutrient enrichment for the benthic ecosystem).";The initial assessment by Greece of biological features is considered inadequate. Although most habitat types and species groups are covered, the information is limited, qualitative and mostly based on the existing literature. Few judgements on status were provided but these are never in relation to GES. Reference to existing international conservation agreements and to the Habitats Directive is scarce.;"Features:
- Most habitat types and species groups are covered but the information is limited, qualitative and mostly based on the existing literature 
- A few judgements on status are provided (but not in relation to GES)
- Little reference to existing international conservation agreements and to the Habitats Directive ";1;Inadequate
Greece;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Greece has defined five environmental targets and four associated indicators to address D1. It should be noted that in the reporting sheets, they have only defined one environmental target (the first one). 

The targets defined are very close to the second part of the GES definition, they relate to the same species/habitats. Some of them are state targets, related to the maintenance of the status of a particular feature, others are monitoring/assessment targets (e.g. inventory of area occupied by biogenic Maerl type sediments) and some are a mix of both types (Conservation and mapping of Posidonia oceanica meadows). No baselines or threshold values are associated with the state targets (or with their relevant indicators) which means that they are not measurable. 

They are time bound (at least in the reporting sheet) but without further information and specific details (in particular with regard to the baselines to be used) it is not possible to determine how realistic or achievable they are.

No mention is made of protected/listed species which are expressly mentioned in the first part of the GES definition. No pressure-reduction target is defined which would help achieve the last criterion of the two parts of the GES definition on the impacts from human activities. ";The set of targets and associated indicators defined by Greece for D1 is considered inadequate. It is relatively specific as it relates to specific species and habitats but it is not measurable and lacks details on the baselines to be used. As such, it is uncertain whether it is achievable and realistic. In addition, as it is limited to specific species and habitats, they would not be sufficient to help achieve GES as defined in the first part of the GES definition (which addresses all habitats/species).;"- Targets focus only on specific species and are not sufficient to help achieve GES

Greece;D1;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressures from physical loss and damage and the status of biological features is relatively consistent with the GES definitions for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 as these contain general statements covering all relevant habitats and features. In addition, the species on which Greece has specifically focused in its initial assessment are those that are used as indicator species in the GES definition for D1.

The GES definition of Descriptor 4 contains several conditions to achieve GES while only one target is provided which deals with only one of the conditions, the ratio of biomass in the higher trophic levels of demersal catches. Both the GES conditions and the targets lack baselines, thresholds and other aspects that would make them clearly measurable. 

With regard to Descriptor 6, both the GES definition and the targets lack thresholds and baselines that make them measurable. The targets do not cover all aspects of the GES definition. The one indicator is not sufficient to measure the achievement of both targets and definitely insufficient to measure the achievement of all aspects related to the GES. ";;;;
Greece;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor level both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report, but the definition in the reporting sheets includes additional information which was considered as accompanying text and that is not transcribed here. The definition is applicable to all three Greek marine sub-regions. None of the criteria or indicators laid out for Descriptor 10 in the 2010 Commission Decision is incorporated in the GES definition. 

Greece acknowledges the need for more information on marine litter and indicates that it is only possible to have a qualitative definition of GES and therefore no thresholds or baselines are provided. In addition, some of the terms in the definition are not specific enough, e.g. “dramatic reduction” or “in the long run”, which does not allow to know when GES will be achieved.

In the accompanying text, Greece mentions that it is “practically impossible” to achieve the goal set by 2020 of a “complete reduction” (understood to mean a complete removal) of marine litter from the coastal and marine environment, which is why Greece proposes an interim goal of “significant reduction”. It still does not specify what “significant” entails.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 10 is considered as inadequate. The definition is only qualitative and insufficient detail is provided in order to assess if and when GES is achieved. ;"- None of the criteria of the Commission Decision are integrated in the GES definition

Greece;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Greece has carried out an initial assessment on the level of pressure and the impacts of marine litter in the Greek marine waters. The type and depth of information reported is similar in all marine sub-regions and, therefore, analysed in conjunction. The assessment focuses more on litter found on beaches and the seabed. It is acknowledged that there is insufficient data on litter in the water column and the water surface. Greece also recognises the need to improve research and monitoring on the impact of marine litter on marine organisms but does not report any schedule for this.

The information is both qualitative and quantitative. A considerable amount of literature is cited, and in addition quantitative information is provided, including the amount of litter found and the percentage of litter of different compositions, referring most of the time to data gathered in 2005-2011 by the Hellenic Marine Environment Protection Association. Trends (stable) and judgements (not good) on the current level of pressure caused by marine litter are provided for beaches and the seabed for all the marine sub-regions. Tourism, shipping and fisheries are listed as the main causes of marine litter in Greek waters. The information on impacts is more limited. The impacted water column, seabed habitats and functional groups are listed, but no trends or judgements are provided due to insufficient data. There is no specific information on micro-particles reported.";The initial assessment of Greece for marine litter is assessed as adequate.

Greece;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Greece has defined one target and one associated indicator to address Descriptor 10. The definition is very similar in the reporting sheets and in the paper report, even though in the reporting sheets it is specified that the indicator relates to monitoring.

The target is not measurable and would benefit from further specification. No thresholds, reference values or baselines are provided. Without a quantitative target, it is difficult to judge the level of ambition. The target does not specifically address pressures (sources) of marine litter, despite the statement on the reduction of the amount of litter in the GES definition. 

In the accompanying text, Greece refers to a number of potential measures that could be taken in order to maintain or achieve GES. These include the monitoring of a number of parameters (including microparticles) and the development of criteria for the assessment of GES for marine litter. However, the link between these measures and the environmental targets is not clear. ";The environmental target and associated indicator defined by Greece for D10 is assessed as inadequate. The target is very similar to the GES definition. It is qualitative and not measurable. ;"- Very similar target to GES definition

Likewise, the environmental target and associated indicator defined for Descriptor 10 are general and does not cover all the different pressures and impacts identified in the initial assessment. ;;;;
Greece;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor level in the reporting sheets and descriptor and criteria levels in the paper report. In both cases the definition is applicable to all three Greek marine sub-regions. 

The definition in the paper report is not entirely clear as there seem to be two different (although not contradictory) definitions: the first definition includes two criteria, but this do not match the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision, the second definition is very similar to the definition in the reporting sheets. 

None of the criteria or indicator laid out for Descriptor 11 in the 2010 Commission Decision is clearly incorporated into any of the definitions (the accompanying text in the paper report includes a copy of the criteria and indicator of the 2010 Commission Decision but these are not incorporated in any of the GES definitions).

Greece;D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Greece has not carried out an initial assessment on the level of pressure from underwater noise. The information reported in the reporting sheets and the paper report is of two types:
-	Past surveys and research projects looking at types and sources of underwater sounds. From this, it lists in the reporting sheets the main sources of underwater noise (defence, shipping and research surveys) and the functional groups impacted (baleen and toothed whales). 
-	Information and data gaps and plans mentioning that there are no monitoring data on underwater noise covering relevant spatial and temporal scales and that there is a need for information regarding the spatial and temporal distribution of noise sources as well as the proximity to habitats occupied by sensitive animals.  

While it is considered that Greece has not carried out an assessment of the noise pressure, the justification provided for not doing so is considered sufficient as it is recognized that very little monitoring exists in relation to continuous low frequency sound (criterion 11.2) and that loud impulsive sounds (criterion 11.1) may not be as relevant for Mediterranean waters as they are for North East Atlantic waters (because of fewer seismic surveys).

The target can be seen as a higher level objective that needs to be specified further. The target is not SMART as there is no provision for specific values, specific forms of energy addressed in the target or dates.  In addition, the target and the indicator are also not very coherent. The target could be applied to 11.1.1 (if the register indicates that the number of pulse days exceeds a threshold for adverse impacts), whereas the ‘associated indicator’ is more in line with the requirements under 11.2.1, as this indicator is specifically designed for monitoring noise. On the other hand, nowhere in the 2010 Commission Decision is monitoring required for indicator 11.1.1.

Greece;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has set GES for Descriptor 2 at the descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. Both of these GES definitions are defined almost the same as the GES definition provided in Annex I of the MSFD. The most important difference is that the Annex I definition states that NIS should not adversely alter the ecosystem while the Greek definitions state that NIS should not cause adverse effects on the environment. However, reference to the ecosystem is made in the complementary definition set in the paper report where Greece has also defined the conditions required for an ecosystem to be considered as being at GES. 

The GES definition as provided in the paper report is risk-based. It reflects partly the minimum requirements (no further increase of NIS, i.e. no new introductions of (harmful) NIS, and where possible no further spreading of them), referring to the reduction of risk from vectors and pathways facilitating such introduction and spread. The GES definition does not set baseline or reference conditions. The Greek definition does not clarify what reduction in risk needs to be achieved nor does it specify what adverse effects are considered covered under the GES definition.";The definition of GES is assessed as inadequate. The main GES definition is a close approximation of the descriptor as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. GES is only set at descriptor level. It reflects minimum requirements with a focus on risk of new introduction. The GES definition also lacks defined reference conditions, baselines and specification of the adverse impacts covered by the definition. ;"- Only set at descriptor level and very close approximation to Annex I definition
- No baseline or reference points";1;Inadequate
Greece;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the paper report, Greece has listed the various NIS found in Greek waters, the year first recorded, their origin, pathway of introduction, population status (e.g. established, occasional, unknown) and their taxonomic group. For the Aegean Sea, Greece has listed 193 NIS and, for the Ionian Sea and the Adriatic Sea, 22 NIS.

In total more than 200 NIS have been found in Greek waters of which the majority were recorded in the South-eastern Aegean Sea and Cretan Sea. The main vectors/pathways are identified as the Canal of Suez and shipping. A qualitative assessment of the impacts for the water column, and seabed habitats as well as for functional groups has been done in the reporting sheets. Specific impacts discussed were those caused by Caulerpa racemosa, Mnemiopsis leidyi and by non-indigenous phytoplankton, but in general it has been concluded that there is still a lack of data on NIS. In particular, the paper report underlines the lack of quantitative data on the abundance, habitat or rate of invasion of NIS, leading to a fragmented picture of the trends of the pressure and their quantitative impacts on the ecosystem. 

No judgement has been made on the status in relation to GES but Greece in reporting sheets states that the pressure from NIS is declining (albeit with a low level of confidence), this however seems in conflict with the paper report which indicates an increase of NIS in the Ionian Sea during the past few years.

Greece has also indicated in the reporting sheet threshold values and baselines for indicators. For indicator 2.1.1, the threshold value is ‘No increase in proportion of NIS in the abundance or biomass of the respective community’, for indicator 2.2.1, for water column, ‘No algal blooms due to NIS’ and, in relation to seabed habitat and functional groups, ‘all NIS spp include <5% of biomass or space coverage’. In all cases, the baseline is the current levels of NIS.";The initial assessment is assessed as partially adequate. Greece reported an extensive list of the NIS found in Greek waters and identified their current status and pathway of introduction. The impacts from NIS have only been described in a general fashion. Knowledge gaps are identified and plans to address those are provided in the environmental targets. Finally, some information in the reporting sheets might be contradictory to the one from the paper report, leading to a lack of certainty and clarity as to the conclusions of the initial assessment.  ;"- Inventory of NIS

Greece;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Greece has specified a single surveillance target along with one associated indicator. The target is to carry out a census of invasive alien species and their environmental impacts by 2020. 

The associated indicator however only seems to be a registry of when NIS species are found. This makes this associated indicator unsuitable for determining the environmental impacts of these species on the ecosystem.

The single target provided by Greece does not set a target state and does not aim at reducing the pressure or impact of NIS to levels that will achieve GES or address the main sources of NIS introductions. ";The target is assessed as inadequate. The single target provided by Greece is a surveillance target and is not sufficient to achieve GES. The deadline of the surveillance target is set at 2020 which is not early enough to use the collected data to set targets that are more appropriate for achieving GES by 2020. Lastly the associated indicator does not have a sufficient scope to measure all aspects of the target.;"- One single surveillance target

Greece;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for Descriptor 3 at descriptor level in the paper report and at descriptor and criteria levels in the reporting sheet. However, none of the definitions proposed actually constitute an actual GES definition, with clearly defined parameters that allow assessment of whether GES is achieved. 

Greece has set thresholds for criteria 3.1 and 3.2 at the indicator level, although none were set for criterion 3.3. What is unclear in both the paper report and reporting sheets is whether these thresholds were applied only to evaluate the current state of stocks in relation to GES or whether these are the official GES indicator thresholds. Considering that the text in the paper report states that these are the criteria for the achievement and maintenance of GES it is assumed that the applied thresholds are the official GES evaluation criteria. In the paper report it is stated that the indicators apply for the main commercially exploited demersal and pelagic species while the reporting sheets state that they apply to the main target species or species frequently caught in bottom trawl and purse seine fisheries; therefore it is considered that the Greek GES definition does not apply to all commercially exploited species. 

The thresholds for criterion 3.1 have been set at F/Fmsy =1 and E=0.4 for exploited pelagic species. The Fmsy threshold is in line with the Commission Decision while setting the exploitation rate at 0.4 is an appropriate proxy of Fmsy for small pelagic species but is not appropriate for the larger pelagic species with longer lifespans. 

The threshold for the indicator of criterion 3.2 has been set at B/Bmsy=1. This indicator does not correspond to the primary indicator SSB or secondary indicator biomass indices from the Commission Decision. Setting the indicator threshold at MSY levels is in line with the Commission Decision and goes beyond current guidance from the Commission for stocks to be at least at or above precautionary levels. 

In the reporting sheets it is indicated that the MSY threshold level estimates for Greece are obtained from the analysis of data from the period of 1990 until 2009 while the E threshold level has been set empirically based on literature information. It is not clear whether these thresholds will be used for future GES assessments and how these thresholds correspond to EU and internationally set MSY reference points.  ";The Greek definition is inadequate. In the paper report and from the texts submitted in the reporting sheets it is not completely clear whether Greece has actually defined a GES definition for Descriptor 3. The threshold set for criteria 3.1 of the Commission Decision for stocks to be at F/Fmsy = 1 is in line with the Commission Decision while the threshold 0.4 for the exploitation rate of pelagic species is an appropriate Fmsy proxy for small pelagic species but not for longer lived pelagic species. The Greek GES texts however imply that the 0.4 threshold applies to pelagic species in general which is not appropriate. The threshold for the secondary indicator 3.2 for stocks to be at B/Bmsy does not rely on the Commission Decision indicators but setting the threshold for criteria 3.2 to be at MSY is in line with the Commission Decision. The GES thresholds do not seem to apply to all stocks but only the main targeted or caught species which is not in line with the Commission Decision for all stocks to be exploited at or below Fmsy with a SSB at or above SSBpa. ;"- Not certain whether GES is defined

- Bmsy applied but only for main species targeted or species frequently caught in the bottom trawl fishery";1;Inadequate
Greece;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);The Greek initial assessment has been performed at a relatively high level of detail. Greece has assessed its different fleets, purse seine, bottom trawl and artisanal fishing fleet. The landings, the fishing effort and discards by the fisheries have all been assessed. The impact of the different fisheries on the environment are only shortly described in a qualitative manner and is not specific for Greece except for the statement that Greek types of purse seine fisheries do not impact the sea bottom and benthos. The text only describes general impacts from fisheries such as disturbance of the sea bottom by trawling without giving any assessment of impacts specifically in Greek waters. Only seven stocks have been qualitatively assessed in relation to MSY reference points for the Aegean and Ionian seas: Mullus barbatus, Mullus surmuletus, Merluccius merluccius, Parapenaeus longirostris, Spicara smaris, Engraulis encrasicolus and Sardina pilchardus. All mentioned stocks have been assessed as being at good to moderate status. Greece in the reporting sheets states that the level of pressure from fisheries is considered good and improving but does state that some stocks are overfished. ;The Greek initial assessment is considered adequate since it covers the status of a number of stocks and the level of fisheries pressure for the different types of fisheries. The IA however only covers impacts from fisheries in a general way and it is not specific to Greek marine waters.

Greece;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Greece has defined four targets in the reporting sheets and three in the paper report to cover Descriptor 3. The last target on biomass at higher trophic levels is reported only in the reporting sheets and not the paper report. 

The first two targets are targets to monitor the status of demersal and pelagic stocks in relation to designated thresholds defined by national and EU legislation. The associated indicators for these targets in the reporting sheets state that the main stocks should be within designated thresholds as defined by national and EU legislation. These however are not fully SMART as it is not clear what the main stocks are or which proportion should be within the designated thresholds. 

Furthermore it is not clear how these associated indicators relate to the achievement of the targets which are simply to monitor the status of the stocks. The third target by itself is especially unclear and does not make any sense without the associated indicators. The last target, only in the reporting sheets is a monitoring target that corresponds to Indicator 3.3 of the Commission Decision. ";The targets are inadequate. The Greek targets are generally vague and refer to main stocks without specifying what these are. As a set, the targets are unclear in how they will achieve GES.  ;"- The Greek targets are vague

Greece;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for D4 at descriptor and criteria levels. In the reporting sheets, only the second part of the definition is reported (as for D1). 

The Greek GES definition as provided in the reporting sheets, with more specific conditions for the achievement and maintenance of GES for D4, has been set at the criteria level and seems to correspond most closely to criteria 4.2 and 4.3 of the Commission Decision. The conditions set to achieve GES for D4 only deal with fish and not with other species groups relevant to D4 such as marine mammals, reptiles and birds. The two specific conditions that should be met to achieve GES are very general and do not define important aspects. For example the GES definition does not specify what are considered the upper trophic levels or what are considered large pelagic fish species. 

The first part of the GES definition, which comes only from the paper report, provides a general GES descriptor definition and a requirement for the by-catch of non-target species to be at levels that do not threaten the structure of food webs. The Greek text that most closely resembles the definition for D4 as provided in Annex I of the MSFD deviates in a number of ways. First the Annex I definition states that it applies to all elements of the marine food webs while the Greek GES refers to the main important groups of the food web. The Annex I definition also refers to maintaining species while the Greek GES refers to maintaining the important groups at levels that ensure the long-term viability of the ecosystem. The Greek text therefore changes the focus from species to the ecosystem at a higher level. It can be inferred that if this is the Greek GES definition, that it is less ambitious in its scope than the Annex I Descriptor 4.

No reference is made to any existing standards in the GES definition, although a tenuous reference is made in the accompany text to Greek conservation legislation, which is based on international conventions and EU legislation.";The GES definition for descriptor 4 is considered partially adequate. The GES definition sets two conditions that should be met in order to achieve GES, these conditions are however vague and do not cover all relevant food-web components. However, in combination with the first, more general part of the GES definition, as provided in the paper report, the coverage of Descriptor 4 at the descriptor level becomes sufficient. However, there is still a lack of coverage of all Commission Decision criteria. In addition, because of a lack of thresholds and baselines, the GES definition is not measurable and it is not possible to know when it is achieved. ;"- As for D1, definition in two parts, which would be inadequate if assessed separately but partially adequate when taken together

Greece;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. All criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 5 in the 2010 Commission Decision except for indicator 5.2.3 (abundance of opportunistic macroalgae) are incorporated in the definition. The definition is very similar in the reporting sheets and in the paper report and is applicable to all three Greek marine sub-regions. In the reporting sheet, Greece indicates the value of 5% in the field “proportion of the assessment area that should achieve the GES thresholds”. While this should be understood as meaning that only 5% of the assessment area should be in line with the GES thresholds for the whole area to be considered at GES, on the basis of information included in the paper report, it seems to indicate that according to the initial assessment, only a proportion of 5% of the assessment areas is not currently in GES.

At indicator level, thresholds are provided for nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll concentrations, water transparency and dissolved oxygen concentrations (5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.2 and 5.3.2), thereby including all criteria (5.1, 5.2 and 5.3). The same thresholds appear to apply to both coastal and offshore waters. Nutrient ratios (5.1.1) are not included in the electronic report, though they are referred to in the paper report. However, the initial assessment suggests that this is not considered relevant for Greek waters.

Greece focuses on the traditional eutrophication monitoring parameters of nutrients, chlorophyll, water transparency and dissolved oxygen status as the major reporting criteria, incorporating in addition impacts on macrophytobenthos and phytoplankton community composition, thereby including impacts on both pelagic and benthic communities. Greece also refers to implementation of the Water Framework Directive, Nitrates Directive and Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, but it does not specify how or whether its proposed GES thresholds match with the Water Framework Directive normative definitions, i.e. whether the MSFD GES is at least equivalent to the Water Framework Directive Good Ecological Status. ";The GES definition of Greece for D5 is assessed as adequate. Greece covers all criteria and most indicators and provides sufficient thresholds against which the achievement of GES can be measured in the short term (even if macrophytobenthos and phytoplankton community composition indices and thresholds still have to be developed).

Greece;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Greece has defined two targets and four associated indicators (common to both targets) to address Descriptor 5. The set of targets and indicators is applicable to all three Greek marine sub-regions. While the wording of the targets differs slightly between the paper report and the reporting sheets, the meaning is the same. 

The targets overlap (the first target incorporates the second target), although the second target is more specific with regards to a particular group of pressure sources. They are pressure reduction-based, but rely on impact indicators and therefore it will not be possible to identify whether the improvement(s) derive from a reduction in point or diffuse source loads. The targets are neither quantitative nor time-bound, except for the overall timescale of achieving GES by 2020. 

Greece defined two associated indicators for macroalgae and harmful phytoplankton. However, since thresholds were not presented for these either as part of the targets or in the definition of GES, it will not be possible to measure them. 

Because of the qualitative nature of the targets, they appear to be both achievable and realistic. Since such a large proportion of the Greek waters is currently considered to be in good status, it seems likely that GES will be achieved by 2020. However, whether the targets contribute to the further improvement of marine environmental status by this date is unknown.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Greece for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. Both targets are qualitative and therefore, in principle, they are achievable and realistic, however, they are not time bound (apart from the reference to achieve GES by 2020) and the first one is very generic. The targets are both pressure-based but the indicators are impact-based.  The inclusion of indicators on macroalgal and harmful phytoplankton is positive but the lack of thresholds means that they are not measurable and therefore not helpful for the achievement of the target. ;"- The targets are qualitative and therefore, in principle, they are achievable and realistic 
- Targets are both pressure-based but the indicators are impact-based
- The target aiming at the reduction of nutrient and organic loads from point and diffuse sources is very generic
- No thresholds have been provided";2;Partially adequate
Greece;D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of eutrophication and its impacts is consistent with the Greek definition of GES in terms of nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll, water transparency and dissolved oxygen status. Organic loading is not considered in the initial assessment, but related impacts on dissolved oxygen status are included in the assessment. Thresholds for impacts on phytoplankton community composition and seabed features (macrophytobenthos) are not included in the definition of GES, and such impacts are considered only in theoretical terms in the assessment, presumably allowing time for the later development of indices to assess compliance with the proposed targets. There are a number of pressures which do not appear to have been considered, such as atmospheric deposition and the potential for groundwater inputs (of nitrogen).

The targets are so broad-ranging and generic in terms of pressure reduction that they cover all pressures and impacts identified in the initial assessment. While the indicators are not very specific (e.g. no mention of particular indices or assessment criteria), they should provide a more holistic assessment of trophic status than the thresholds presented under Article 9 reporting, since they include metrics of both pelagic and seabed status. However, the targets do not appear to offer any greater emphasis to reduce marine eutrophication pressures and impacts than that under existing EC legislation, particularly as the targets are so broad in terms of pressure reduction and are qualitative only. While some relatively minor reductions in loads may occur on a national scale, the targets are not focused on those eutrophication hotspots discussed in the initial assessment.

It is not clear whether the targets will be sufficient to achieve GES. On the one hand, the vast majority of the Greek waters appear to be in a state of GES at present with regard to Descriptor 5. On the other hand it will depend on how the localised areas that are currently most impacted will benefit from the reduction targets.";;;;
Greece;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for Descriptor 6 at descriptor and criteria level. The difference between the definition in the paper report and in the reporting sheets is the same as for D1 and D4. It is therefore unclear what is considered to constitute the GES definition. 

The Greek GES definition for Descriptor 6 as provided in the reporting sheets and paper report provide two conditions for GES to be achieved which correspond to indicators 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the Commission Decision. These GES conditions do not contain thresholds, baselines or other aspects that would make them measurable. The text does however refer to an ‘unacceptable level’ which needs to be exceeded and a ‘good ecology quality’ which could be considered as the reference condition.

Biogenic substrates are not specifically mentioned, only benthic communities. However it could be understood that the mention of benthic communities and marine habitats does include biogenic substrates. Specific reference to biogenic habitats is also made in the accompanying text and initial assessment.

The first part of the GES definition, provided only in the paper report is a close approximation of the D6 definition as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. It is considered that the two criteria of the Commission Decision are covered, but not all indicators. Similarly to the specific conditions defined for the achievement of GES in the second part of the definition, these general conditions are equally not measurable because no threshold values or baselines are provided. The first part of the definition includes generic terms such as “sufficient”, “long-term” and “healthy”, which, without further specification, are not measurable.  The lack of baseline means that the requirement to “maintain” benthic ecosystems’ extent cannot be measured as it is unclear what levels should be maintained (presumably the current one but it is not specified). The general definition does not necessarily require an improvement in the condition of benthic ecosystems, but the “maintenance” of their extent and a condition that they are sufficiently productive. 

No reference is made to any existing standards in the GES definition although there is reference to the WFD in the accompanying text but only for seabed features located at a depth greater than 50m. ";The GES definition for Descriptor 6 is considered inadequate since it is only a very close approximation to the Annex I of the MSFD definition. As a result, it lacks thresholds, baselines or other aspects that would make the achievement of GES measurable. Besides, there is no reference to WFD in the definition.;"- As for D1 and D4, definition in two parts, the first defining GES at a general level with the second defining GES only for two specific indicators

Greece;D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

Greece has carried out an initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage for the three Greek marine sub-regions: the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea and the Aegean-Levantine. The information is limited (even more so in the reporting sheets) and consists mostly of references to the relevant literature. Greece acknowledges that it possesses insufficient data regarding physical loss, in particular with regards to the extent of habitats loss, and reports the need to address the relevant gaps in forthcoming monitoring projects. In addition, Greece refers specifically to the lack of data concerning the spatial distribution of the fishing effort, which precludes reaching any conclusions on the physical damages caused by this activity.

The main causes of physical loss are listed in the reporting sheets for all three sub-regions (land claim defence, tourism and cables and pipelines), as are the main features impacted (littoral rock and sediment, shallow coarse and mixed sediment, mud, rock and sand, shelf coarse and mixed sediment and sand). No quantification, trends or judgements on the current status have been reported. In the paper report the main physical processes and human activities that might cause physical loss are listed and very briefly described.

The structure of the information reported on physical damage is similar. The main causes of physical damage are listed in the reporting sheets for all three sub-regions (fisheries, dredging and aquaculture) as are the main features impacted (shallow coarse and mixed sediment, mud and sand, shelf coarse and mixed sediment, mud and sand). As for physical loss, no quantification, trends or judgements on the current status have been reported. In the paper report the main human activities that might cause physical damage and the benthic habitats impacted are listed and very briefly described. In addition, the paper report includes a brief and very general description of the current status of the areas assessed but no definitive conclusion is presented.

Biological features (Inadequate; 1):

Habitats
Greece has carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the three marine sub-regions. The information is usually general, consisting of numerous references to existing literature. The assessment is mainly qualitative. Greece acknowledges gaps in the knowledge on the level of disturbance and the percentage of habitats impacted, and states that additional information will be gathered in the framework of the monitoring obligations under the Water Framework Directive.

The information reported focuses on benthic habitats as it is indicated that issues related to pelagic ecosystems are connected with eutrophication and therefore addressed in that section of the report. The main predominant habitats – shallow sublittoral sand, mixed and coarse sediment and mud, shelf sublittoral mud, mixed and coarse sediment and sand – are listed and briefly described (in the paper report) and the main pressures identified (including physical loss and damage, nutrient enrichment, introduction of hazardous substances). Posidonia oceanica meadows are reported as a special habitat in the Adriatic Sea and in the Ionian Sea, together with a descriptive judgement on their current status and trend (declining). The paper report besides addressing the Posidonia oceanica meadows provides information also on biogenic of Maerl type. There are no references to the Habitats Directive or to the relevant regional sea convention.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Different types and causes of physical loss and damage are documented and reported as are some impacts; nonetheless the information is very limited and mostly based on the existing literature.

Greece;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Greece has provided two targets for D6 and one associated indicator. None of the targets are SMART. One of them is a monitoring/assessment target, related to the mapping of habitats, while the other one is a state target, which relates to only one of the four conditions defined for GES (on the number of opportunistic species in benthic communities). 

The associated indicator clearly relates to the second target but no threshold values or baselines are defined that would make it measurable and would help assess when the target is considered to be achieved. ";The GES is considered inadequate since it lacks thresholds, baselines or other aspects that would make the achievement of GES measurable. In addition, the two targets defined are clearly not sufficient to help achieve GES, the scope of which is much broader than only benthic macrofauna. ;"- Targets and associated indicators are not SMART, no threshold values or baselines specified

Greece;D6;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressures from physical loss and damage and the status of biological features is relatively consistent with the GES definitions for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 as these contain general statements covering all relevant habitats and features. In addition, the species on which Greece has specifically focused in its initial assessment are those that are used as indicator species in the GES definition for D1.

The GES definition of Descriptor 4 contains several conditions to achieve GES while only one target is provided which deals with only one of the conditions, the ratio of biomass in the higher trophic levels of demersal catches. Both the GES conditions and the targets lack baselines, thresholds and other aspects that would make them clearly measurable. 

With regard to Descriptor 6, both the GES definition and the targets lack thresholds and baselines that make them measurable. The targets do not cover all aspects of the GES definition. The one indicator is not sufficient to measure the achievement of both targets and definitely insufficient to measure the achievement of all aspects related to the GES. ";;;;
Greece;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor and criteria levels. The definition is not a mere reproduction of the definition of the MSFD and contains what is considered to be accompanying text (and which is not reproduced here). The definition is common to the three Greek marine sub-regions. There is no reference to the criteria and indicators laid out in 2010 Commission Decision and no justification has been provided.

Only some hydrographical changes are addressed (mainly related to water column) and no criteria related to pressures, ecosystems or functions have been set. There is also no reference to space or time scale or mention of any threshold values or baseline values, although features and pressures addressed by GES are indicated in the reporting sheets. The accompanying text clarifies some elements of the definition e.g. reference to the mean summer, winter or annual water temperatures within the euphotic zone. The Water Framework Directive normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters and UNEP/MAP State of the Mediterranean Marine and Coastal Environment SoMMCER 2013 are not referred to and no information is given regarding achievability by 2020.";The GES definition of Greece for D7 is considered as inadequate.

Greece;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Initial assessments with regard to the level of pressure of permanent hydrographical alterations or to their impacts on water column, seabed habitats and functional groups were carried out for the three marine sub-regions. The information included in the reporting sheets is very similar for all three sub-regions apart from the description of particular pressures or features affected; in the paper report there are separate sections for each sub-region which have additional, but mainly descriptive, information. Therefore the analysis below refers to the initial assessments for all the three sub-regions. 

Despite providing some information on the level of pressure of permanent hydrographical alterations and their impacts on habitats and functional groups, Greece recognizes that there is lack of data which is mainly due to the sporadic nature of the information collated and proposes setting a “national-wide network of stations” in order to gather the relevant information on a more regular basis. The features, habitats and species groups impacted have all been described and industry, agriculture and forestry were identified as being the main causes of the pressure. The information provided is not entirely coherent with the information included in the UNEP/MAP SoMMCER 2013, since only large scale/water column pressures/impacts are addressed and little mention is made to pressures/impacts related to small and near the shore local changes (works, etc.) or sediment processes. Judgements (quantitative and qualitative, and using as baseline the pre-1990s period) have been made but only on the level of hydrological changes and on the impact on water column habitats, which were both considered as good for all regions, but no trends assessment has been carried out. Greece has also reported on marine acidification, providing the results of a series of measurements and listing the main causes of pressure – industry and shipping – but acknowledging at the same time the need for further monitoring and investigation.";The initial assessment of Greece for permanent hydrographical alterations is assessed as partially adequate. The assessment covers only a part of the relevant pressures, impacts and changes, changes related to coastal activities and works are not addressed. Sufficient information on impacts is not provided.

Greece;D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Greece has defined one environmental target and two associated indicators (including several parameters) to address Descriptor 7 both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report, although the wording is slightly different. The target and the associated indicators are applicable to all three Greek marine sub-regions.

The target is close to the definition of Descriptor 7 and is not SMART. It is not specific enough, or measurable as it is described in a very general way (some concepts are not explained e.g. “alterations” or “human activities”). In addition, there is no clear relationship between the target as defined and the list of parameters provided (temperature, salinity, etc.), which can be related neither to pressures (“local human activities”, “permanent alterations”) nor to “environmental impacts”. These parameters cannot be considered indicators, and as a consequence the target cannot be measured through these parameters. The target does not mention large-scale impacts or impacts on habitats and functions.

No direct reference is made in the targets to compliance with existing regulatory regimes (e.g. EIAs) or to the WFD normative definitions for coastal waters.";The environmental target defined by Greece for D7 is assessed as inadequate.

In addition, as the target is not specific enough, it would not lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts. The target and the indicators are not sufficient to achieve GES, which is mainly related to large-scale conditions, while the target focuses on local impacts. ";;;;
Greece;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at the descriptor level in the paper report. GES is defined the same way for all three subregions. In the reporting sheet, Greece has added two definitions at criteria level (8.1 and 8.2), which are not reproduced in the paper report. These two definitions provide a little more specificity to the general definition as they introduce the threshold values to be used (identical for all three subregions) and refer to concentrations in seabed and biota for criterion 8.2. 

In the reporting sheet, the definition at descriptor level is longer than that of the paper report because it includes what has been considered as accompanying text. This text is not reproduced in the present report for presentation purposes (apart from the threshold values) but has been taken into account in the assessment of adequacy. In the accompanying text, Greece explains that the defined GES threshold values are based on a number of national, regional and EU standards, including the WFD and the EQS Directive and OSPAR’s sediment quality guidelines, assessment criteria for heavy metals, PCBs and PAHs in mussels and oysters and fish and ecotoxicological assessment criteria for water. Other national standards are also mentioned. While a comparison of each GES threshold defined by Greece with relevant standards is difficult (because of a lack of information on how Greece has defined these standards), a high-level consistency check reveals that the standards used by Greece are comparable to the EQS and Environmental Assessment Criteria (EAC), although sometimes higher (e.g. GES thresholds for cadmium, mercury and lead in water are higher than the EQS defined in Directive 2008/105/EC). On the contrary, the background concentrations defined by Greece are sometimes lower than the OSPAR’s Background Concentrations (BAC), e.g. for heavy metals in sediment. Grouping together all PAHs and PCBs substances also makes it difficult to compare with agreed levels (e.g. no explanation for the thresholds for PAHs and PCBs in fish and mussels). 

In terms of substances, Greece provides a defined list of substances covered by the GES definition:
•	Synthetic: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine compounds (PCBs, DDTs and Drins) 
•	Non-synthetic: metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Hg), and petroleum hydrocarbons 
•	Radionuclides: 137 Cs

These substances are the same as those measured for the purpose of the initial assessment. They do not cover all priority substances of the EQS Directive but they correspond to some of the substances covered by the OSPAR EAC for sediment and biota (PAHs, PCBs and heavy metals). 

The matrices covered by the GES definition are the three relevant matrices for D8 (water, sediment, biota). The standards used for the measurement in biota (fish and mussels) are mostly those of Regulation 1881/2006 on foodstuffs (also assessed under D9), which are those used by OSPAR as well. While it is recognized that the use of dietary standards is not fully satisfactory in the context of an assessment addressing environmental risk, satisfactory standards agreed at the EU level have not been defined for substances other than the three for which an EQS already exists in biota (Hg, HCB, HCBD). Greece does not use the EQS in biota for mercury however. 

Greece mentions that the baseline used is the pristine state of open sea surface waters. Greece also uses the BAC defined by OSPAR. Greece mentions in its GES definition for criterion 8.1 that background values should be reached “ultimately”. It is not clear what the time schedule of this long-term objective is. It should also be recalled that contrary to the EQS or the EAC, the BAC are not risk-based. 

Criterion 8.2 on effects of contaminants is defined only in reference to concentration of contaminants in sediment and biota. Greece refers to the OSPAR EAC for sediment and for biota (in combination it seems with EU thresholds for foodstuffs). As the EAC are developed in an integrated manner taking into account contaminants’ concentrations and their biological effects, it is relevant to use them to assess biological effects. However the EAC cover only fish and shellfish (mussels/oyster). Restricting criterion 8.2 to concentrations of contaminants in sediment and biota means that biological effects on other species/functional groups are not covered in the GES definition (e.g. seabirds or dog whelks as per the OSPAR EcoQOs). It also means that criterion 8.2 as defined by Greece does not cover indicator 8.2.2 on acute pollution events at all. In the reporting sheet however, Greece mentions that a number of birds, fish and cephalopod functional groups are addressed by the GES definition. For birds and cephalopods, the link is not as direct as for fish but in an indirect way (through the food web), it is relevant to say that these functional groups are covered by the GES definition.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 8 by Greece is considered partially adequate. Greece has defined GES for both criteria of the Commission Decision, however coverage of criterion 8.2 on effects of contaminants is not considered adequate as only concentrations in sediment and biota are measured, other biological effects in species/functional groups are not considered and acute pollution events are not covered at all. With regard to concentrations of contaminants, Greece has defined its GES thresholds in reference to the EQS Directive and OSPAR EAC/BAC and while most are in comparable range, they are not always within agreed levels. In addition, setting specific values for GES rather than referring directly to the EQS means that if the EQS values change by 2020, the Greek values will not follow. Greece does not cover all priority substances of the EQSD but partly covers radionuclides, which is considered a good practice. Using the pristine state of open sea surface waters as a baseline is not necessarily realistic considering that it is unlikely that any European marine waters are in a pristine state anymore. A more realistic baseline would be “concentrations found in areas remote from point sources of pollution”. Finally, using OSPAR’s standards for the Mediterranean is reasonable considering that MEDPOL has not defined criteria. ;"- Coverage of the two criteria of the Commission Decision, but 8.2 is only partly covered: biological effects measured only through concentrations of contaminants and acute pollution events are not addressed
- Fixed thresholds defined in reference to EQS and OSPAR EAC/BAC (reduced possibilities for evolution of thresholds)
- Not all priority substances covered but radionuclides included (+++)
- Using pristine state as baseline may not be realistic";2;Partially adequate
Greece;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
In the reporting sheets and paper report, Greece has provided a very limited description of the different sources of contamination by hazardous substances (e.g. atmospheric deposition, shipping activities, oil extraction, industrial and wastewater treatment wastes, discharge of metal containing waste, industrial production). It does not provide any quantification of input loads or even general trends for man-made substances. For heavy metals, it mentions that atmospheric depositions, and in particular Saharan dust, are significant contributors to inputs of heavy metals in the marine environment and provides for the various assessment areas, input loads of fluxes from Sahara dust. 

Greece proceeds to an assessment of concentrations in water, sediment and biota of synthetic (PAHs, PCBS, DDTs and Drins) and non-synthetic substances (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Hg and petroleum hydrocarbons). In the reporting sheets, Greece only presents the concentrations in biota (mussels and fish) but in the paper report, concentrations in water, biota and sediments are provided for five different assessment areas (North, South and Central Aegean, Ionian Sea-Adriatic and Levantine). Because of data availability, all substances are not systematically measured in all matrices for all five regions and often (wide) ranges are provided (e.g. in the Central Aegean area, PAHs concentrations range from 0.8 to 9370 µg/kg dw) but a mean value is sometimes provided. Greece often refers to various hot spots in each assessment area. In the reporting sheets, Greece reports that, in the Aegean subregion, only 1-5% of the assessment area is affected by pollution from synthetic substances and sometimes less than 1% for heavy metals.

In the paper report, Greece mentions that data for the Ionian Sea-Adriatic area is scarce. For the Levantine area, Greece mentions that, because of lack of data, it cannot provide a quantitative assessment of concentration levels but that in general concentration levels of hazardous substances (synthetic and non-synthetic) are low. 

For synthetic substances, Greece provides a very limited qualitative description of the types of impacts on marine organisms (bioaccumulation). For heavy metals, it just mentions that concentrations on the whole do not adversely affect seabed habitats and functional groups, although some concentrations in some areas are higher than permissible levels (e.g. Zinc in the liver of the species Xiphias gladius in the North Aegean area exceeds permissible levels). No mention is made of specific biological effects (e.g. imposex).  In the reporting sheets, Greece concludes that in all three assessment areas (Ionian, Adriatic and Aegean) the impacts of contaminants on seabed habitats and functional groups are considered to be of limited importance, using as indicators the lack of mention of “mass extinctions or mutations even in the most polluted areas”, without any further specification. In the reporting sheets, Greece provides the list of the seabed habitats and functional groups impacted by the pressure (for all three regions, for seabed habitats: littoral rock and sediment, shallow coarse and mixed sediment, mud, rock and sand; and for functional groups: birds (inshore benthic, herbivore, pelagic and surface, intertidal benthic, offshore pelagic and surface), coastal and shelf cephalopods, fish (coastal, pelagic and pelagic elasmobranchs)).

In terms of judgement, Greece summarizes in the paper report section on GES the results of the assessment by stating that contaminant concentrations have decreased between 1997 and 2012 and that stable trends have recently been observed. It concludes that most of the assessment areas are already at GES and only a proportion of 1-5% of the areas remain to achieve GES. In the reporting sheets, it concludes that concentration levels for both synthetic and non-synthetic substances, in the environment and functional groups, are acceptable in relation to GES (i.e. status is good) in the three assessment areas, using the same threshold values as those reported under GES. It also mentions that trends in status are stable. It reports that impacts on seabed habitats and functional groups are acceptable (i.e. status is good). However it acknowledges that no particular threshold value has been established, which is in line with the fact that no criterion has been defined for impacts on ecosystem components in the GES definition. 

Greece mentions however that there are still hot spots, mainly in coastal areas, where contaminant concentrations are occasionally high, exceeding maximum permissible levels. It is not clear what aggregation rule Greece has used in order to come to the conclusion, in the reporting sheets, that the three subregions are at GES. 

Greece acknowledges information gaps regarding sources of contamination (e.g. riverine inputs) and input loads. It also reports knowledge gaps on impacts on ecosystem components (in particular in top predators) and on the bioavailable fraction of the metals, which constitutes a threat to the marine environment. Finally, it reports data gaps for certain geographical areas (South Aegean, Levantine Sea) and for the open sea. In terms of future plans, it mentions on-going research projects (without more specifications) which should yield results within three years of the start of the monitoring programmes (presumably those of Article 11 of the Directive) in Greek marine waters. 

Radionuclides
Greece has made a relatively detailed assessment of contamination by radionuclides in the five assessment areas. It assesses only one substance, 137Cs, but describes in detail the sources of contamination (atmospheric nuclear weapon tests, Chernobyl accident, discharges from nuclear installations, nuclear testing sites, nuclear submarine accidents, applications in medicine and industry). It provides historical trends based on concentration levels following the Chernobyl accident and concentration levels after 2000, concluding that in two areas (North Aegean and North Ionian), trends have been increasing, while they have been decreasing in the other areas. It also provides current concentration levels in water, sediment and biota in each assessment area (except Levantine for which it has no data). Most of the time it provides (wide) ranges and mean values. It has not done an assessment of impacts from radioactive contamination on ecosystem components. 

In terms of judgement, Greece concludes that current concentration levels of 137Cs in the environment and in functional groups are acceptable (i.e. status is good), using the threshold values of set in the GES definition, and that trends in status are improving. It also concludes that current impacts on ecosystem components are acceptable (i.e. status is good) and trends in status are improving, but with no particular threshold values or data to support this conclusion. The baseline used is the natural radioactivity measured in the marine environment if the Chernobyl accident had not occurred.

Greece mentions that there is insufficient data on the contribution of marine or air-based sources of radioactive pollution to the marine environment and on the impacts of radioactive substances on functional groups. Again, Greece refers to on-going research projects (but with no more details) to address these gaps. 

Acute pollution events
Greece provides a relatively detailed account in the paper report on the various types of acute pollution events and the various sources of oil pollution. It does so at a general level, for the whole of the Greek marine waters, and in more details for each assessment area, describing the number, localisation and extent of the events that have occurred in the period 1997-2011. For three assessment areas out of five, the information is limited and mostly qualitative. 

Greece describes briefly the types of impacts on various marine organisms (algae, shells and molluscs, marine birds, turtles, seals and fish). No quantification of the level of impacts is provided for the various assessment areas however. 

In terms of judgement, Greece concludes that levels of contamination by acute pollution events are acceptable (i.e. status is good) and that trends in status are stable, but it acknowledges that it does not have any threshold values to base this conclusion on (which is in line with the lack of GES criteria on acute pollution events in the Greek GES definition for D8). 

In terms of data gaps and future plans, Greece mentions that local and state authorities (the Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection) should record incidents in greater detail and develop a network of experts who could record the impacts of such events, in order to obtain better data on the particular characteristics of acute pollution events. ";The initial assessment of contamination of the Greek marine waters by hazardous substances and acute pollution events is considered partially adequate. Despite a number of important data gaps and a lack of quantification of input loads, Greece has made a detailed assessment of concentration levels for all substances concerned and made a judgement on these concentrations in relation to GES. The assessment of impacts on functional groups and seabed habitats is very weak however and conclusions in relation to GES are not based on objective threshold values. Finally, Greece acknowledges data gaps regarding the state of the open sea but still concludes that 95% of the assessment area is at GES. Considering that the areas most polluted are more frequently on the coast, more information on the open sea should support this assessment but it is not clear what proportion of the marine waters have actually been measured.  ;"- Detailed assessment of concentration levels for all substances concerned

- Weak assessment of impacts on functional groups and seabed habitats 
- Conclusions on impacts in relation to GES are not based on objective threshold values

Greece;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Greece has set one target and two associated indicators to cover D8. The target and indicators are the same for all three subregions. The target in the reporting sheets and the one in the paper report are slightly different in wording but the meaning and purpose are similar. One minor difference is that the target in the reporting sheet does not mention “impacts” but refers to “pollutant effects”. 

The target defined for D8 is a monitoring target, i.e. a target that requires the MS to monitor contaminant concentrations and effects but not to actually reach specific levels or reduce specific pressures. While the associated indicators refer to concentrations and types of hazardous substances, no threshold values or other types of parameters are associated with these. This would make the target measurable and would allow to determine whether the target is considered to be achieved. 

In addition to this generic target, Greece mentions a number of measures to be taken in order to maintain or achieve GES. These include reduction of inputs of contaminants from various sources or developing good practices to monitor, assess and handle acute pollution events. Greece also mentions the link to Descriptor 9 as well as to a number of EU directives that will assist in the achievement of the target, including the WFD, the Dangerous Substances Directive and the Urban Waste Water Directive. ";The target and associated indicators defined by Greece to cover D8 is considered as inadequate. The target simply requires Greece to monitor contaminant concentrations and effects. It is definitely realistic and achievable but it is not possible to assess whether it is enough to achieve or maintain GES by 2020 since it does not contain any quantitative threshold values. Even if Greece considers that most of its waters are already at GES, such a target is not useful to ensure that GES is maintained until 2020.;"- Only one target on the monitoring of contaminant concentrations and effects
- Not enough to ensure that GES is maintained by 2020";1;Inadequate
Greece;D8;Consistency ;;"Overall, there is a good level of consistency between the assessment of contamination by hazardous substances and the definition of GES. The same substances and the same thresholds have been used for the assessment and the judgement on the current level of contamination. One inconsistency relates to the judgements made by Greece on impacts from contamination on ecosystem component in relation to GES, when no GES criterion has been defined on biological effects. The same applies for the positive judgement on the level of contamination from acute pollution events, for which no GES criterion has been developed by Greece. 

The target and associated indicators are also consistent with the initial assessment considering that they are so vague and generic. They do not address any of the sources of contamination mentioned in the initial assessment but this is in line with the mention by Greece that there is a lack of data on sources. While the initial assessment clearly refers to a number of hot spots where levels are higher than regulatory levels, no target has been defined to address these specific areas.  

Because the set of targets and indicators is so generic, it is not certain whether it will help achieve GES. It does not address the state component of the GES definition (concentration of contaminants) and it does not address impacts (biological effects) or pressures (sources) either. ";;;;
Greece;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Greece has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor level in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, it has added a definition at criterion level, using only part of the Commission Decision criterion 9.1. Greece’s criterion 9.1 only covers levels of contaminants and does not refer to the number and frequency of contaminants which exceed regulatory levels. 

Greece refers to “certain regulatory levels” in its general definition. In addition, in the accompanying text and in the reporting sheet, Greece provides a table with the substances to be measured in two species, red mullets (fish) and mussels, and the threshold values to be complied with. These have been defined in relation to Regulation 1881/2006 and Greece mentions a number of other agreements/standards taken into account to develop the threshold values (including OSPAR’s EAC and national standards). While most standards are at least equivalent to EU and OSPAR standards, it is not clear how the thresholds for PAHs and PCBs have been derived. They are therefore difficult to compare. In addition, a number of substances are not covered in the GES definition for D9 in comparison to Regulation 1881/2006 (dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs).  

It is not specified in the GES definition which fish and mussels species should be used for the measurement of contaminants. In the accompanying text however, Greece refers to Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mediterranean mussel) and Mullus barbatus (red mullet) as bioindicators. It is not actually clear whether these two species would be used by Greece as indicators to assess the achievement of GES. Greece also refers to “top predators”, in which concentration levels have been found to exceed regulatory levels, but does not specify which ones. In the reporting sheets, as for D8, Greece mentions that a number of birds and fish functional groups are addressed by the GES definition. 

Greece specifies that the baseline to be used is the pristine state of open sea surface waters but GES is defined in such a way that determining a baseline is not actually necessary (there is no condition for concentrations to decrease, only to remain below a certain limit value). 

In the accompanying text, Greece mentions that the initial assessment has looked at fish and foodstuff that are “fished or cultured”. This may suggest that the D9 GES definition of Greece covers also aquaculture products. This is not in line with the Commission Decision, which refers to organisms “caught or harvested in the wild”. 

In the accompanying text, and still in reference to the initial assessment, Greece also mentions that the fish and foodstuffs assessed were those “in the waters of the subregions in the Greek jurisdiction”. If it is to be considered that the same parameters used for the 2010 initial assessment should be used for the determination of whether GES has been achieved, the inclusion of a geographical criterion (origin of the fish and seafood monitored) can be considered a good practice. ";The GES definition for D9 by Greece is considered partially adequate. Greece considers that its marine waters are already at GES with regard to D9 but has still provided independent criteria for the measurement of D9 in order to be able to assess in 2020 if GES has been maintained. The Greek D9 GES definition is partly in line with the minimum requirements: compliance with Regulation 1881/2006. The GES thresholds defined by Greece are at least equivalent to those in Regulation 1881/2006. Uncertainty remains for the values defined for PAHs and PCBs however and dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are not covered. As with D8 however, using fixed values for the GES definition, rather than reference to the appropriate EU legislation, means that if the EU standards evolve up to 2020, the Greek GES definition will no longer be in line. There is also uncertainty with regard to the exact species that should be used as indicators to assess achievement of GES. Greece mentions two species used in the initial assessment, but the links between the parameters used for the IA and for the GES definition are not clear. This also relates to the origin of the fish and foodstuff to be monitored as well as the potential inclusion of aquaculture products. Finally, the second part of criterion 9.1 on frequency is not addressed in the GES definition. ;"- Partly in line with the minimum requirements: compliance with Regulation 1881/2006
- Fixed GES thresholds are at least equivalent to those in Regulation 1881/2006, but issue of evolution of EU standards not reflected in Greek GES definition
- Second part of criterion 9.1 on frequency is not addressed";2;Partially adequate
Greece;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances is made in combination with the general assessment of contamination by hazardous substances (see D8 section). The method and approach used is described in this section and will not be repeated here.

Greece makes a number of (positive) judgements on the levels of concentrations in fish and shellfish (what they call “biota”) in relation to the thresholds defined in Regulation 1881/2006 (which correspond partly to their GES definition). As mentioned previously, in the GES section of the paper report, Greece refers to the conclusion from the initial assessment, which is that regulatory levels are rarely exceeded in the Greek marine waters. Top predators are identified as a sensitive species however.

In addition to this assessment, Greece provides a qualitative assessment of contamination by microbial pathogens. It includes graphs of the evolution of the quality of bathing waters over the years and describes the monitoring in place in relation to shellfish waters. The microbiological indicators used for this monitoring include E. coli and Enterococci. No conclusive judgement is made on the level of contamination from microbial pathogens but Greece notes that the trend in bathing waters is stable and that there is limited scope for improvement.";The assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances and microbial pathogens is considered partially adequate. The assessment is made on the basis of the regulatory levels set in Regulation 1881/2006 (although all substances are not covered). No mention is made of the origin of the samples although it is probable that they come from the Greek marine waters as they were assessed as part of the assessment of the water and sediment.  ;"- Assessment of current concentrations of contaminants against Regulation 1881/2006 standards

Greece;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Greece has defined one environmental target and two associated indicators to cover D9. The target/indicators are the same of the three marine subregions. The definitions in the paper report and in the reporting sheets differ slightly. In the paper report, the addition of the word “maintain” acknowledges that the current levels of contamination are acceptable (i.e. below regulatory levels) and that the objective of the target is to keep levels below regulatory levels. 

The target defined by Greece is measurable since it includes compliance with permissible levels. These are not specified either in the paper report or in the reporting sheets (i.e. as threshold values) but it is understood that these refer to the thresholds defined in the GES definition, which are the same as EU foodstuff limit values. It is a state target. Greece has not defined any pressure target for D9.

While the first indicator is in line with the text of the target, the use of second indicator on number of contaminants in fish and other seafood destined for human consumption is less clear. It is neither mentioned in the text of the target, nor in the GES definition and no threshold value has been set. 

The target and indicators are completely unspecific with regard to the substances and species addressed. 

In the accompanying text, Greece refers to the links between D8 and D9. It also mentions that a measure that will help achieve GES is to develop a strategy-protocol of contaminants monitoring, focusing on catch originating from areas facing pollution problems and top predators influenced by bioaccumulation. This potential measure recognises two major issues for D9: the origin of the samples and bioaccumulation in top predators. However it is not part of the environmental target. ";The set of target and indicators defined by Greece to cover D9 is considered partially adequate. It is unspecific with regard to the substances and species addressed but it is measurable (as it contains a direct reference to permissible levels) and realistic, considering that GES is already achieved in the Greek marine waters. ;"- Measurable target and indicators because direct reference to “permissible levels”
- Realistic target since GES already achieved
- Not fully SMART because lack of specification of the contaminants that should be measured and the species to be used for the sampling";2;Partially adequate
Greece;D9;Consistency ;;"The assessment of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption by hazardous substances is consistent with the GES definition in the sense that it covers the same substances and species (if these indicator species are used for the assessment of GES which is not fully clear). It is also not clear whether the assessment of current status has been made solely on the basis of the EU Regulation or whether the GES thresholds defined by Greece have been taken into account. Presumably, these match but there are a number of inconsistencies and gaps, as noted in the GES assessment. 

In the conclusive part of the initial assessment, it is mentioned that regulatory levels have been exceeded in certain top predator species of fish however it is not clear whether these are covered by the GES definition. Also, no target has been set on top predators when it has been recognised as an issue.  ";;;;
Ireland;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland has defined the good environmental status for Descriptor 1 at descriptor level, but not at indicator or criteria levels. Ireland indicates that further development is needed so that the GES definition is expected to be operational by 2018 if adopted. It is not clear what is meant by ‘if adopted’ but this is the wording used by Ireland without further explanations.

GES has been determined at the descriptor level but not at the criterion or indicator level.  Justification is given for not defining GES as the criterion level and what is being done in the future in terms of targets and indicators for each criteria is summarised. There is a justification for not determining GES for each criteria or indicator. For criteria 1.1 – 1.3 the justification explains that habitats and birds reporting will be carried out under the appropriate Directives, hence covering only selected habitats. For these criteria, Ireland indicates that it is also investigating the use of appropriate operational EcoQOs, with regard to their relevance and operability in Irish waters, as well as the potential of the plankton ‘life form’ approach for biodiversity assessment.

For criteria 1.4 – 1.7 no suitable indicators have been developed. Ireland simply indicates that investigations are underway to explore and develop suitable metrics without further details.

The definition of GES is a general text which covers broadly the MSFD Annex 1 text.  It also includes additional text suggesting biodiversity should not only be ‘maintained’ but also ‘restored’ if appropriate. There is also reference to ‘ecosystem structure and function’ and the ’condition of key species and habitats’. In the reporting sheet, Ireland states that its GES definition addresses all main biodiversity components (birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and cephalopods), functional groups and the main zones for water column and seabed habitats. This is also inferred by the first two points of the GES definition which refer to ‘overall biodiversity’. The ecosystem structure is specifically mentioned in the GES definition but without further definition of the term ‘not compromised’.

The definition of GES does not directly refer to the definitions for Favourable Conservation Status under the Habitats Directive and for Good Ecological Status under the Water Framework Directive. However, the mention of ‘habitats and species requiring protection under existing legislation and the requirement that they will be conserved effectively through appropriate mechanisms’, implies that the Habitats and Birds Directives and the Water Framework Directive are included.

No direct reference is made to reference conditions but Ireland mentions ‘prevailing physiographic, geographic and climate conditions’ as baseline for its GES definition. It is not certain whether these should be understood as meaning ‘free from anthropogenic influence’. This means that it is not clear what quality levels any restoration should aim to achieve. There is also no specific mention of what deviation from this is acceptable. ";The definition of GES for D1 is considered inadequate. There is limited and indirect coverage of the criteria of the Commission Decision. The GES definition infers that all biodiversity components are covered at a high level, however its focus lies with key and species and habitats which are not further specified. The formulation of GES remains purely qualitative, without baseline or threshold values, and sometimes vague in its formulations. There is clear ambition to restore biodiversity where appropriate, but this is not linked to any specific baseline or past state. No information is given as to when it is or is not appropriate to restore biodiversity. The definition of GES is very general and only at the descriptor level and as such it would be very difficult to judge whether GES has been achieved.;"- GES defined at descriptor level, Commission Decision criteria covered only indirectly
 - Definition covers only listed/protected species
- Lack of specificity of certain terms which would make the GES definition measurable
- No baselines";1;Inadequate
Ireland;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Ireland has not reported at a functional or species group level but only on individual species and this only includes fish.  For birds, Ireland justifies that the status of bird species will be reported under the Article 12 of the Birds Directive. For mammals, Ireland also mentions that the status of mammal species is reported under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive. For these two species group and for fish, Ireland provides some information on its plans to adapt and aggregate reporting on the Habitats and Birds Directives and to work on the “sensitivities” of fish species to anthropogenic pressures to allow reporting of these species at functional group level for the MSFD. Ireland also refers to OSPAR’s EcoQOs for marine mammals. No justification is provided for the lack of assessment on cephalopods. 

The information reported for a wide range of commercial fish species including demersal, deep sea and pelagic species is concise and usually quantified, with reference to relevant standards (MSY and SSB). The state of the species in relation to natural conditions is reported for the species population size only. The main pressure affecting the species is reported (extraction of species). For most species, Ireland has made a judgement on the current status of the species. In a few cases, it has even made a judgement in relation to GES (in good or bad status) but in a majority of cases the status is descriptive. It is based on Fmsy or on trends. The status of most species is reported as being improving or stable, only for a few species it is reported as declining (Cuckoo ray, Horse mackerel and Lophius piscatorius). 

Habitats
Ireland has reported on habitats using the MSFD classification of predominant habitats. Ireland has reported on all predominant habitat types for the seabed except on abyssal habitats. Ireland justifies that this predominant habitat type is not present in Ireland's Assessment Area according to current literature and mapping data. Ireland has not reported at all on water column habitats. Reduced/variable salinity waters have been identified as being reported under the WFD. In addition, Ireland states there is insufficient information or data on other water column habitats to report them as a habitat type. Finally, Ireland mentions that habitats covered by the Habitats Directive will be reported according to Article 17 of the Directive. 

In addition, Ireland has reported on six individual habitats, two of which are included in the OSPAR list of threatened and/or declining habitats (Carbonate mounds and Zostera beds). In addition, Ireland mentions that its reporting on predominant habitat “shallow sublittoral mixed sediment” also covers Ostrea edulis beds, part of the OSPAR list. The other individual habitats are reported as predominant habitat type defined for the Irish Assessment Area (upper slope sublittoral mud, upper slope rock and biogenic reef, upper slope sublittoral sand, upper slope mixed sediment). Ireland specifies that the upper slope lies between 200 and 750 m; this seems to be located between the shelf zone and the upper bathyal zone.  

Ireland reports a lot of descriptive and primarily qualitative information in particular on the habitats’ conditions (less so on habitats’ distribution and extent). The main pressures are identified for each habitat type, which do include those affecting the physical and chemical and biotic characteristics of each habitat. Although Ireland does not make a conclusive judgement on the status of the habitat types in relation to GES, it does make an assessment of the current status in relation to natural conditions. For almost all habitat types (except shallow sublittoral mixed sediment), the state is reported as being in line with natural conditions. Shallow sublittoral mixed sediment is the only habitat type for which Ireland has further described its current status, acknowledging that it is under threat, basing its assessment on historic records of Ostrea edulis beds distribution in the Irish assessment area.

The assessment of gaps and future plans is minimal, primarily outlining the paucity of information and saying that the information gaps will be considered when establishing a monitoring programme under Article 11. It also refers to the outcomes of various EU research programmes (HERMIONE, HERMES). For shallow sublittoral coarse sediment monitoring under the WFD and Habitats Directive will also contribute new information. 

Ecosystems
No assessment has been made of ecosystems. ";The initial assessment by Ireland of biological features is considered partially adequate. The assessment of habitat types can be considered adequate but the assessment of species and functional groups is limited only to fish species. The justification provided for not covering the other species group is relevant for protected species but not for other species. The information reported is mostly qualitative for habitat types and more specific for fish species. An assessment of status is made only for fish species.;"Features:

- The assessment of species groups covers only fish but the arguments provided are relevant at least for some of the groups missing
- Judgement on current status for some habitats and fish species but only rarely in relation to GES";2;Partially adequate
Ireland;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);Ireland has not defined targets to cover the biodiversity descriptors. Ireland mentions that it is co-operating with OSPAR to develop environmental targets and that the work is on-going. However this is not considered as a sufficient justification for not reporting targets for biodiversity. ;Not reported.;"- Not reported

Ireland;D1;Consistency ;;"The assessment of pressures and biological features is partly consistent with the GES definition, however the lack of reporting on the main species group is inconsistent with the definition of GES for D1 which encompasses all biodiversity elements. 

The assessment of physical loss (1%) and damage (5-25%) has been assessed but is not reflected in the assessment of habitat types where all except one are assessed as being in natural condition.

Ireland has not set targets so it not possible to assess the consistency of the initial assessment with the targets nor whether the targets would be sufficient to achieve GES. ";;;;
Ireland;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor level. The criteria of the Commission Decision (characteristics of litter and impacts of litter) are integrated in the GES definition, albeit in a very general way. None of the indicators are reflected in the definition. 

The GES definition is based on the definition of the Directive. To this, it adds a required reduction over time and makes reference to small plastic particles and micro-particles. A threshold value and baseline have not been set by Ireland because of a lack of data and knowledge on marine litter and the impact it has on the marine environment.  Ireland refers to the OSPAR 2010 QSR.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 10 is considered as partially adequate. The GES definition is set at descriptor level, even if impacts are very generally addressed.  It includes small plastic and micro particles in its scope and a requirement to reduce litter over time.;"- GES definition at descriptor level but impacts are addressed from a general perspective
- Includes small and micro plastics in its scope

Ireland;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Ireland reports substantial information for beach litter and for seabed litter. For beach litter, the OSPAR methodology has been used. For seabed litter, data is collected mainly using trawl surveys under the Irish Groundfish Survey (IGFS) and the ICES International Bottom Trawl Survey (ITBS). Ireland reports data gaps on litter in the water column, on the water surface and on the impact of marine litter on marine organisms both at population and community level. 

With respect to beach litter and seabed litter, the available information was insufficient to assess trends. Further involvement in OSPAR and IGFS is expected to improve data availability. A number of methodologies are mentioned to address the gaps for macroscopic litter and smaller particles, such as fishing for litter, but need to be further refined for the purpose of the MSFD.";The initial assessment carried out by Ireland on marine litter is considered adequate. The information reported is substantial and adequate in light of current state of knowledge. Ireland acknowledges the gaps in its assessments and provides a number of plans to address these. ;"- Substantial information reported for beach and seabed litter

Ireland;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Ireland reports two targets, each associated with one indicator. The targets are identified in accordance to the Commission Decision. The two associated indicators are directly copied from the Decision. Reference is not given to the two other indicators from the Decision, namely indicator 10.1.2 on litter in the water column and indicator 10.1.3 on micro-particles. 

The targets could be measurable if made more specific on what the trends are and how they will be measured. Ireland acknowledges that no quantitative target has yet been defined and mentions that the indicators will be operational in 2014. No baseline is provided either. The existing OSPAR targets are not directly referred to. Yet, Target 1 implicitly refers to the OSPAR beach litter monitoring (however, it is not clear which specific categories/types are covered) and Target 2 to the EcoQO for the ingestion of plastic by Fulmars.

A reduction of small and micro-particles is included in the GES definition. Yet, a target has not been defined and data is not available. The GES definition is too general and it is difficult to assess whether GES can be achieved. In general, the GES definition and targets would benefit from further specification.";;;;
Ireland;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor and criteria levels but not using the indicators as specified in the Commission Decision. The definition is purely qualitative, no threshold values or baselines have been provided.

The GES definition only refers to underwater noise and does not include other forms of energy such as thermal energy, electromagnetic fields and light. The definition refers to adverse effects at the population levels, or specifically to vulnerable / threatened species and key functional groups. This is more ambitious than the Commission Decision definitions which only refer to “significant impacts on marine animals”. In addition, in the reporting sheet, Ireland specifies which functional groups are addressed by the GES definition. The Irish D11 GES definition addresses species at large spatial scale (referring to population levels). 

In the accompanying text to the GES definition, Ireland mentions that further development is needed for this descriptor, which is expected to be operational only by 2018. Ireland mentions the various sources of sound in Irish marine waters (seismic activities, sonars, pile-driving, etc.) and mentions that it is currently compiling a register of impulsive sound. It provides more details of the plans in place to collect additional data on continuous sound and risks to key marine mammal species. The objective of this research work is to develop a ‘risk-based’ noise monitoring programme to inform the development of quantitative targets and indicators. ";The GES definition of Ireland for D11 is assessed as partially adequate. The GES definition has integrated the criteria from Commission Decision and provides an indication of the scale at which this descriptor will be assessed. However, the definition lacks specificity in that the indicators of the Decision have not been used and no threshold values or baselines have been specified.;"- GES defined at descriptor and criteria levels
- Scale at which GES should be assessed is provided

Ireland;D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The initial assessment identifies seismic surveys, sonar pile driving, acoustic deterrent devices and explosives as the main causes of impulsive noises while shipping has been the identified as one of the largest contributors to low frequency ambient noise. The actual level of the pressure has been regionally and temporally high but very varying and covering less than 1% of the Irish waters of the marine region which is in line with the investigations carried out in the UK. For example for the Sound generated from seismic surveys the spatial distribution of seismic exploration between the years 2000 and 2011 has revealed 11 specific areas of interest relating to the oil and gas industry. The GES status has not been judged due to a lack of established methods. 

To improve knowledge on noise in the Irish environment Ireland currently has two main research projects on marine noise which will be used to inform the development of a ‘risk-based’ noise monitoring programme. This will lead to the quantification and better understanding of the environmental impacts of underwater sound in Irish marine waters. The impacts mentioned in the initial assessment and planned measures however seem to focus exclusively on the impacts of noise on cetaceans while the impacts are not necessarily limited to marine mammals. ";The initial assessment of Ireland for the introduction of noise in the marine environment is assessed as adequate. The initial assessment has collated the relevant data and clearly explains which actions are being undertaken to improve knowledge on this pressure.;"- Relevant data collated

Ireland;D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);Ireland has not defined targets for D11. In the reporting sheets, Ireland justifies the lack of targets for D11 with the lack of established baseline and knowledge on the impacts of elevated sound and continuous low frequency sound on the marine environment.

Ireland;D11;Consistency ;;"The initial assessment is not fully consistent with the GES definition as it only covers cetaceans, while the GES definition addresses a number of functional groups from the bird, mammals, fish and cephalopods species groups.

However the lack of targets means that it is not possible to assess the consistency of these with the initial assessment and the GES definition. ";;;;
Ireland;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland set GES for Descriptor 2 only at descriptor level, not at criteria or indicator levels, with a focus on reducing the risk of introduction and spreading rather than on impacts as per the Directive. It addresses the reduction of the risk from pathways and vectors of introducing and spreading non-indigenous species covering in a very indirect way criterion 2.1 of the Commission Decision. The GES definition adds that if there is introduction and spread of NIS, these should be controlled or reduced where possible. 

Ireland notes that ‘further development needed (expected to be operational by 2018 if adopted).  GES assessment methods are not yet defined at a European level. Further development of GES assessment under Descriptor 2 is required, and Ireland adds that ‘discussions are on-going at a European level’, without further specifications.

However, the GES definition is not specific enough to judge whether GES has been achieved. In particular, it does not include any baseline or threshold. ";GES definition is considered as partially adequate. GES is achieved when risk on new introductions are significantly reduced and if introduced measures are taken and address pathways and vectors. It takes a risk-based approach and, consequently, does not aim at ‘no new introductions’ but rather a reduction of the risk. It does not include the current pressure of NIS. There are no baseline or reference conditions. ;"- GES definition does not cover directly the Commission Decision’s criteria
- No baseline or reference points";2;Partially adequate
Ireland;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Ireland reports 79 known NIS, noting that the list is likely to be incomplete. It notes that eight out of the 35 marine species included in the DAISIE list of invasive species are recorded in Ireland (Anguillicola crassus, Amphibalanus improvisus, Bonnemaisonia hamifera, Codium fragile, Coscinodiscus wailesii, Crassostrea gigas, Ficopomatus enigmaticus, and Styela clava). Ireland describes in details the reasons for uncertainty with regard to the NIS present in Irish marine waters. 

The main vectors of introduction have been identified (maritime transport through ballast water and ship fouling, and aquaculture), together with an analysis of limitations, recognising that ‘there is often only speculative and unsupported information available on dispersal pathways for existing NIS in Irish marine waters’.

There is some information on the pressure status but trends are not determined. Features that are impacted are lacking, but proportion of features is assessed only for seabed habitat (less than 1 %). A judgement on the level of impact for different habitats is missing. Ireland indicates its intent and makes specific proposals to consider how best to improve the understanding of the presence, distribution, trends and impacts of NIS in Irish marine waters, when developing the monitoring programmes. It also refers to the report of the MSFD GES Task Group 2 on NIS for assistance in determining criteria and methodological standards to allow ";The assessment is considered to be adequate.

Ireland;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The first target is a pressure/measure target. It is relatively specific as it defines how the risks will be reduced i.e. through species prioritisation and improved management of high risk pathways and vectors. However, it is not measurable as there is no baseline justified by the lack of adequate historical monitoring data. Given the lack of specification, it is not possible to judge if this is achievable and realistic. The timeframe is up to January 2020.

Combined with the vague definitions of GES, there is no quantification, thresholds, reference conditions and baseline. No specification is given as to how to reduce the risk, to which levels and which specific sectors or pathways to address, although the latter can be implied through reference to the initial assessment (maritime transport and aquaculture). 
 
The second target is not very specific. There is no indication as to which key high-risk NIS should be targeted and as to implementation of the plans. Besides, it is not clear whether it relates to introduction or controls. It is realistic and measurable although in a limited way given the lack of specification regarding the content of the action plans. Besides, there is no baseline justified by the lack of adequate historical monitoring data. The timeline is 2020 but only for the development of the action plan itself not for its implementation.

This target is not ambitious enough to reduce the pressure or impact to levels that will achieve GES. The development of action plans is quite easy but is spread over a very long time frame, the implementation and execution of the plans should also be part of the target. It is not specific enough to judge on its level of ambition. The target does not cover specific sources of new introductions.";The targets are assessed as partially adequate. They are not fully SMART, in particular they lack specification and quantification. There are no associated indicators, as the indicators are a mere repetition of the targets themselves. ;"- The targets relate directly to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts but without any specification

Ireland;D2;Consistency ;;"While the assessment has identified particular species and vectors/pathways, the definition of GES and environmental targets remain very general. 

There is a lack consistency between the GES definition and the initial assessment. The GES definition is incomplete at indicator level. However, the initial assessment appears to be quite sufficient, which means it should be possible to define GES in a sufficient way for descriptor level, criteria level and for all indicators.

Ireland;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland has defined GES for Descriptor 3 at descriptor level, however the definition incorporates the criteria of the Commission Decision. 

The first sentence of the GES definition states that the populations (SSB) of stocks needs to be within safe biological limits which can be interpreted as being at SSBpa. This is in line with guidance from the Commission. However, Ireland does not state in its definition that “all” stocks of commercially exploited fish and shellfish species should be within safe biological limits. There is some uncertainty therefore regarding which stocks are covered by the definition. 

The second sentence states that stocks should be exploited at levels which ensure longer term sustainability and sufficient reproductive capacity. This does not necessarily mean Fmsy and can also be interpreted as the exploitation rate being at Fpa, which is not in line with the guidance of the Commission that all stocks should be exploited at or below Fmsy. 

The third sentence incorporates criteria 3.3 but does not set any thresholds or limits.  This is in line with guidance from the Commission, which accepts that there is insufficient data available at this time to define this criterion further. The last sentence that the GES definition will be consistent with the CFP reform could mean that the GES could be sufficient or insufficient depending on the outcome of the reform. ";The GES definition is partially adequate. The GES definition implies that the reproductive capacity (criteria 3.2 of the Commission Decision) of stocks needs to be at least at SSBpa. Criteria 3.3 (population age and size distribution) of the Decision has also been incorporated, which is in line with guidance from the Commission. Regarding criteria 3.1, the GES definition is not sufficiently specified to mean that all stocks will be exploited at or below Fmsy and can therefore not be considered adequate. ;"- All stocks need to be within safe biological limits

Ireland;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Irish initial assessment provides a detailed assessment on the level of pressure from fisheries, the percentage of stocks for which fishing mortality is at or below Fpa or Fmsy (fish: 62%, shellfish: 60%) and the percentage of stocks for which the SSB is at or above Bpa or Bmsy-trigger (fish: 60%, shellfish: 71%). Fishing fleets and developments in fishing pressure have been described in detail.

The extraction pressure on finfish has been judged as not good but improving while the pressure on shellfish stocks has been judged as not good and stable. The status of a large number of specific demersal, pelagic and deep sea stocks has been reported on in detail, including whiting, anglerfish, haddock, blue whiting, plaice, herring, mackerel, hake, sole, albacore, bluefin tuna, orange roughy and more. The stocks were assessed where possible in relation to the Fmsy and BMSY-trigger reference points.  Along with an assessment of current status, trends for the stocks were also assessed, indicating whether they were declining, stable or improving.  For the pressure of fisheries on functional groups and seabed habitats, various studies assessing impacts are quoted in particular regarding the impacts of fisheries on cetaceans. Furthermore Ireland has assessed the extraction of seaweed and maerl but does not provide a judgement on the level of pressure. ";The Irish assessment on fisheries pressure is considered adequate. The assessment provides an assessment on the fishing fleets, level of fishing pressure, fish stocks and covers various impacts that are the result of fisheries pressure. Furthermore Ireland has made a judgement on the status of finfish stocks in its marine waters in relation to GES (not good). ;"- Fishing fleets described

Ireland;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Ireland has defined four targets for descriptor 3 each accompanied by two indicators except for Target 4 which has three associated indicators. Each target has a baseline set. For Targets 1 and 2 the baseline is “stock specific FMSY reference points are used for assessed stocks. Where not available, proxies are applied, which give a robust estimate of a fishing mortality rate associated with high long-term yield. These include Fmax, F0.1, M, and F20-40%SPR. For data limited and non –assessed stocks, proxies are applied which indicate long term sustainability.” 

Fmsy is the accepted threshold and is in line with guidance from the Commission. Regarding the proxies of Fmsy however the Task Group 3 Report states that acceptable proxies are F0.1 or the F where SSB/R is about 34-45% of SSB0, Fmax was considered too high and risky and it was advised to avoid using this indicator. Therefore the use of F0.1 by Ireland is correct but indicator F20-40%SPR should have a higher lower limit while Fmax is considered as not acceptable. 

For Target 3 the baseline has been set as “Biomass levels corresponding to fishing at FMSY in the medium to long term, taking into account natural variability and scientific uncertainty,” while the threshold has been set as at or above SSBmsy. This is inline and even goes beyond the guidance from the commission that stocks must be at least at or above SSBpa. 

Regarding Target 4 the baseline has been described as “to reflect populations fished at or below Fmsy in the medium to long term” and the threshold as “stock specific values reflecting long term sustainability and incorporating natural variability and scientific uncertainty.” At this moment it can be assumed that these baselines and thresholds are not clearly defined due to a lack of data in this area. 

A common issue for the Irish targets is that they are written in a slightly noncommittal way stating that targets aim to restore and maintain populations. Furthermore the targets do not explicitly state which stocks are addressed by the targets since they refer to “harvested species.” The interpretation of what species are considered harvested species could lead to some confusion as certain by-catch species should also be regulated and covered by descriptor 3. ";The Irish targets are partially adequate. Fishing mortality is set at Fmsy, however some of the proxies suggested for Fmsy are not in line with guidance from the Task Group 3 Report. Regarding SSB, the threshold is set at or above SSBmsy which is in line and even exceeds the minimum requirements for Descriptor 3. Target 4 incorporates criterion 3.3 and the associated indicators from the Commission Decision. Although at this moment no measureable thresholds have been set, this is sufficient considering the current knowledge available. In general the targets do not clearly specify which stocks are covered and remain slightly vague regarding the commitment of the targets for stocks to be in accordance with the baselines and thresholds set.;"- Target to exploit species at or below Fmsy but not all proxies in case MSY reference point not known are not appropriate
- Application of threshold SSBmsy exceeds minimum requirements
- Not clear which stocks are covered, therefore commitments of the targets are not necessarily sufficient to achieve GES";2;Partially adequate
Ireland;D3;Consistency ;;"The Irish work on Descriptor 3 is generally consistent; the targets are not in conflict with each other as a set or with the GES definition. The initial assessment provides the relevant information to assess whether the targets are being met. However, since Ireland has as a target for stocks to be exploited at Fmsy and have a SSB at or above SSBmsy, a distinction should be made for stocks which are currently at Fpa and SSBpa and those which are currently at Fmsy and SSBmsy. The Irish assessment furthermore assesses the extraction of maerl and seaweed, however no targets addressing these fisheries are set. This could be considered a gap but the Commission has not yet provided guidance on fisheries of this particular type. ";;;;
Ireland;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland has defined GES for Descriptor 4 at descriptor and partly at criteria level. With regard to the definition at criteria level, although productivity of key species or tropic groups (criterion 4.1) is not explicitly mentioned in the GES definition, it is implicit in the GES definition. The GES definition also covers explicitly the abundance/distribution of key trophic groups/species (criterion 4.3). However, there is no mention of the proportion of selected species at the top of food webs (criterion 4.2). With regard to criterion 4.2, Ireland states that it is presently examining the potential of the Large Fish Index (LFI). This is likely to refer to the work undertaken within the framework of OSPAR, which is developing an associated indicator on Large Fish as an EcoQO. Similarly as for D1, Ireland indicates that further development is needed so that the GES definition is expected to be operational by 2018 if adopted.  

The GES definition refers only to key and vulnerable species without specifying which species groups/habitats they might cover. No species are considered specifically as indicators of change in the food web.

In terms of baseline, the definition refers to ‘prevailing conditions’. It also refers to ‘indicative of sustainable exploitation’, which could be understood as a quality threshold for GES, but does not provide a definition of what is meant with these terms or whether prevailing conditions should be understood as meaning “free from anthropogenic influence”.. Without further specifications, it is difficult to measure and assess achievement of GES. 

In addition to the lack of specificities of the GES definition for Descriptor 4, Ireland has not set environmental targets and indicators. Ireland only mentions that ‘investigations are underway to explore and develop suitable metrics’, without explanations as to why targets have not been developed. ";Taking into account that D4 requires unfamiliar assessment approaches, the GES definition for D4 by Ireland is considered partially adequate. The definition covers two of the Commission criteria albeit in an indirect way. It is not clear which food web components (species, habitats, trophic levels) are to be addressed (as key or vulnerable species). GES is defined at a very high-level without further specification as to what is meant with “prevailing physiographic, geographic and climate conditions” or “sustainable exploitation” used as baselines/reference conditions or GES thresholds. ;"- GES defined at descriptor level and partly and indirectly at criteria level

Ireland;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor level. In addition to the GES definition, Ireland provides threshold values related to OSPAR Common Procedure assessment levels for nutrient concentrations (> 50% above (salinity related and/or region specific) background concentration), and relevant WFD standards. It also specifies baselines, again related to OSPAR Common Procedure (elevated nutrient levels (> 50% above (salinity related and/or region specific) background concentrations) and WFD (deviation from reference condition set for high/good and good/moderate boundary for physico-chemical and biological elements).

Read in conjunction with the threshold values and baselines and the accompanying text to the GES definition, it can be said that the definition covers a number of indicators from the Commission Decision (nutrient concentrations (5.1.1), opportunistic macroalgal abundance (5.2.3), chlorophyll-a (5.2.1), abundance of perennial seaweeds and seagrasses (5.3.1), and dissolved oxygen status (5.3.2)). The criteria which appear not to be included are nutrient ratios (5.1.2) and water transparency (5.2.2). While ‘species shifts in floristic composition’ does not appear to be covered as an indicator (justified by Ireland which states that “no data for species shift in floristic composition and benthic to pelagic shifts are available”), spatial and temporal variability in phytoplankton abundance and community composition (5.2.4) appears to be monitored (by inference). If this is so, presumably the outcome of OSPAR's considerations on the development of a phytoplankton index is awaited. Ireland indicates that GES is not determined by any single parameter but by the holistic assessment of a number of quantitative criteria which reflect, once inter-linked, the main cause/effect relationships of the eutrophication process.

For coastal waters, MSFD GES thresholds are based on deviation from WFD reference conditions set for high/good and good/moderate boundary for both physic-chemical (presumably nutrients and dissolved oxygen, but it is not clear whether organic material concentrations are included) and biological elements (it is also not clear whether there is any disaggregation of these for MSFD assessment purposes). For offshore areas, OSPAR-derived nutrient thresholds (50% above natural conditions) are used. 

The OSPAR COMP procedure is not used in full for offshore waters, and the criterion selected (nutrient concentrations) falls considerably short of the requirements of the WFD. It is unclear whether the national WFD-based approach for coastal waters sufficiently includes direct and indirect impacts with regard to phytoplankton (including chlorophyll levels, changes in floristic composition and water transparency) and macrophytobenthos, or whether disaggregation of some indices is necessary.";"The GES definition of Ireland for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The overall definition of GES, read in conjunction with the accompanying text, covers a number of the Commission Decision criteria. It is unclear whether disaggregation of biological elements from WFD monitoring is required or intended for status assessments in coastal waters; however, the apparent selection of higher threshold values for WFD ‘high’ status coastal waters should provide greater protection for these areas. However, the use of nutrient concentrations as the sole criterion for assessing the trophic status of offshore waters is not considered sufficiently adequate.";"- GES definition encompasses all the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision

Ireland;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The initial assessment carried out by Ireland on eutrophication provides qualitative and quantitative information. All relevant nutrients – nitrogen and phosphorus – and organic matter are covered. The impact assessment focuses primarily on coastal, rather than offshore waters, but also includes considerable insight to transitional waters, which are outside the scope of the MSFD. Agriculture, forestry, industry and urban discharges are indicated and the main causes of eutrophication. 

Changes in water transparency are not included/assessed, and there is a clear dearth of information regarding offshore macrophytobenthos communities, although it is not certain whether such communities exist or not in Irish waters beyond 1nm. No clear link has been established between toxic algal blooms and elevated nutrients due to anthropogenic inputs, and no data for species shifts in floristic composition/benthic to pelagic shifts are available. There are very few problem areas of nutrient enrichment for coastal and offshore waters around Ireland.

Under the OSPAR Common Procedure, chlorophyll levels in all areas fall below the threshold value, but oxygen supersaturation (values> 130%), which can indicate elevated phytoplankton photosynthesis, has been recorded in 14 areas.

Ireland has not made a judgement on the level of pressures or impacts, apart from on the level of phosphorus (considered to be “good”, i.e. acceptable), but a considerable amount of detail is presented. Overall, nitrogen and phosphorus river loads are decreasing (albeit less dramatically for nitrogen), with surface winter nutrient levels in offshore waters elevated for both nutrients in < 1% of the MSFD assessment area. Dissolved oxygen levels appear to be reduced in a small number of coastal waters, but the levels encountered are not sufficient to cause widespread zoobenthos mortality.";The initial assessment of Ireland for eutrophication is assessed as adequate.

Ireland;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Ireland has defined 7 targets and associated indicators in the reporting sheet to address Descriptor 5. All of the targets are measurable and suitably specific. 

The targets are time-bound and the timescale of the achievement of the target is set to January 2021 (rather than December 2020). Indicator 5.2.2 of Commission Decision (water transparency) has no target set, but the Decision states ‘where relevant.’ Presumably Ireland considers transparency not to be an issue, since chlorophyll levels are generally within GES threshold values, for coastal waters at least.

The targets are sufficiently geared towards reducing levels of impacts which are preventing GES from being achieved. If the targets are achieved then those human activities which can prevent GES from being achieved are de facto being controlled to a sufficient extent. 

The environmental targets are considered to be sufficiently ambitious to reduce the impact to levels that will achieve GES since Ireland considers that there are currently few eutrophication problem areas in its coastal and offshore waters, and trend analysis suggests that pressures are either declining or remaining stable.

The targets are consistent, and offer greater protection to WFD coastal waters than offshore waters. On one hand, the fact that the trophic status is not determined by a single parameter but by the holistic assessment of a number of quantitative criteria provides a serious hindrance to the determination of the trophic status as required under the MSFD, but on the other hand the targets should still enable a relatively robust assessment, albeit that impacts on phytoplankton and offshore seabed communities would continue to remain unknown.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Ireland for D5 is assessed as adequate. They are all specific, measureable, realistic and ultimately achievable. Since the targets effectively define GES, their achievement will automatically result in GES being achieved, but this also means that they should have been reported against Article 9. The targets are all specific with regards to impacts of eutrophication, but not to controlling individual pressures. Most targets, apart from Targets 1 and 2, are valid for coastal water bodies only. However, Ireland seems to have adopted a risk-based approach in the setting of its targets. According to the initial assessment, Ireland considers that there are relatively small and few eutrophication problem areas and that these areas are predominantly in transitional waters. Consequently, it has set targets to address issues with its WFD coastal waters, which should by default address any potential problems with its offshore waters. This however relies on the assumption that transboundary inputs (whether from adjacent marine areas or via atmospheric deposition) are relatively minor (which seems to be the case according to the initial assessment).;"- SMART
- Consistent and ambitious
- Well-focused to the reduction of impacts
- Good link with the WFD";3;Adequate
Ireland;D5;Consistency ;;"The pressure-impact analysis is consistent with the D5 GES definition, since GES is defined in terms of meeting WFD- and OSPAR-derived thresholds/objectives, and it is largely WFD and OSPAR monitoring data and results which are used for the pressure-impact analysis. Transboundary inputs (i.e. inputs from adjacent marine areas) are not considered as part of the pressure-impact analysis, although such fluxes could contribute to an increase in nutrient levels, particularly nitrogen in coastal waters. The operation of combined sewer overflows during/following heavy rainfall was also not considered in the pressure-impact analysis, but this could contribute to localised eutrophication-relevant acute pollution events in coastal waters.

The set of targets should be sufficient to achieve GES since it is likely that GES is already being achieved in the vast majority of Irish marine waters.";;;;
Ireland;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The GES definition for Descriptor 6 is set at descriptor level. The definition in itself does not cover directly the Commission Decision criteria and indicators. Criterion 6.1 (physical damage, having regard to substrate characteristics) is not clearly addressed. There is no particular reference to the relevant biogenic substrate and substrate types.  

Criterion 6.2 on the condition of the benthic community is addressed but only in a partial manner. The definition addresses habitats in relation to productivity and extent. The condition of the benthic community itself is covered only for habitats and species designated under national or international agreements as needing protection. 

The definition is rather vague and many terms are not sufficiently specific to enable assessment of whether GES is achieved or not (e.g. “sufficiently productive/extensive”, “healthy and sustainable”). GES is achieved when seafloor integrity is ‘safeguarded’ or ‘maintained’ to be ‘in line with prevailing conditions’.  There is no specific mention of what deviation from this is acceptable, only that seafloor habitats should be ‘sufficiently productive and extensive’. There is no ambition to improve quality, only to maintain it at a specific level.

No mention is made to EU or regional standards (in particular the Water Framework Directive). ";The GES definition for D6 by Ireland is considered inadequate. The definition covers only some of the Commission criteria and in an indirect way. GES is defined at a relatively high-level.

Ireland;D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

Ireland has made a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant types and causes of physical loss in their marine waters. The main activities causing physical loss are well described. They include coastal defence, placement of pilings for offshore energy developments, oil and gas pipelines, dredging, etc. The assessment made by Ireland is generally quantitative, with detailed information of where the activities causing physical loss are located. In order to make this assessment, Ireland has used information reported under different processes and in particular OSPAR and the WFD between 2004 and 2011. It reports that less than 1% of the assessment area is affected by the pressure. The assessment made of the level of pressure from physical damage is equally detailed and quantitative. The main causes and activities responsible for physical damage are well described and include fisheries (in particular trawling), coastal defence and aquaculture. The area affected by physical damages is assessed to constitute 5-25% of the total assessment area. 

The assessment of impacts from physical loss and damage is more limited. It is qualitative and, for physical loss, limited to certain localized areas under pressure from a specific activity (e.g. offshore installations or wind farms). Ireland provides the list of ecosystem components impacted by the pressures, which refers to the major zones for seabed habitats (except abyssal habitats) and fish functional groups (except coastal fish). 

Ireland has not made a conclusive judgement on the level of, and impacts from, physical loss and physical damage. It justifies that by stating that no methodology is currently in place to make these judgements and provides limited information regarding future plans (developing methods to expand baseline data in order to identify, assess and prioritise pressure/sector relationship).

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
Ireland has reported on habitats using the MSFD classification of predominant habitats. Ireland has reported on all predominant habitat types for the seabed except on abyssal habitats. Ireland justifies that this predominant habitat type is not present in Ireland's Assessment Area according to current literature and mapping data. Ireland has not reported at all on water column habitats. Reduced/variable salinity waters have been identified as being reported under the WFD. In addition, Ireland states there is insufficient information or data on other water column habitats to report them as a habitat type. Finally, Ireland mentions that habitats covered by the Habitats Directive will be reported according to Article 17 of the Directive. 

In addition, Ireland has reported on six individual habitats, two of which are included in the OSPAR list of threatened and/or declining habitats (Carbonate mounds and Zostera beds). In addition, Ireland mentions that its reporting on predominant habitat “shallow sublittoral mixed sediment” also covers Ostrea edulis beds, part of the OSPAR list. The other individual habitats are reported as predominant habitat type defined for the Irish Assessment Area (upper slope sublittoral mud, upper slope rock and biogenic reef, upper slope sublittoral sand, upper slope mixed sediment). Ireland specifies that the upper slope lies between 200 and 750 m; this seems to be located between the shelf zone and the upper bathyal zone.  

Ireland reports a lot of descriptive and primarily qualitative information in particular on the habitats’ conditions (less so on habitats’ distribution and extent). The main pressures are identified for each habitat type, which do include those affecting the physical and chemical and biotic characteristics of each habitat. Although Ireland does not make a conclusive judgement on the status of the habitat types in relation to GES, it does make an assessment of the current status in relation to natural conditions. For almost all habitat types (except shallow sublittoral mixed sediment), the state is reported as being in line with natural conditions. Shallow sublittoral mixed sediment is the only habitat type for which Ireland has further described its current status, acknowledging that it is under threat, basing its assessment on historic records of Ostrea edulis beds distribution in the Irish assessment area.

The assessment of gaps and future plans is minimal, primarily outlining the paucity of information and saying that the information gaps will be considered when establishing a monitoring programme under Article 11. It also refers to the outcomes of various EU research programmes (HERMIONE, HERMES). For shallow sublittoral coarse sediment monitoring under the WFD and Habitats Directive will also contribute new information. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment

Pressures:
The initial assessment by Ireland of physical loss and damage is considered partially adequate. While the level of pressure from physical loss and damage is well-described and quantified, the assessment of impacts on ecosystem components is very limited. No judgement is made on the level of and impacts from the pressures, not even qualitative. Gaps and future plans are mentioned but not described in details. The adoption of very large assessment area (all Ireland) and the lack of an assessment in relation to particular predominant habitat types/substrate types may mask more significant losses/damage in relation to particular habitat types.

Features:
The initial assessment by Ireland of biological features is considered partially adequate. The assessment of habitat types can be considered adequate but the assessment of species and functional groups is limited only to fish species. The justification provided for not covering the other species group is relevant for protected species but not for other species. The information reported is mostly qualitative for habitat types and more specific for fish species. An assessment of status is made only for fish species.

Ireland;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor level in the reporting sheets. The two criteria laid out for Descriptor 7 in Commission Decision are effectively incorporated in the GES definition. As GES is defined only at qualitative level no threshold values or baseline/reference conditions are indicated. This means that there is no further specification of the terms nature, “scale”, “significant” or “long-term impacts”. In the Feature Overview reporting sheet, Ireland presents a justification in relation to criterion 7.2. As this criterion is integrated in the GES definition, albeit very generally, it is assumed that this justification relate to the further development of criterion 7.2 and of indicators 7.2.1 and 7.2.2. Ireland only mentions that coordination is needed at EU level for the development of this criterion, referring to OSPAR advice on GES for Descriptor 7.

The features and pressures addressed by the GES definition are specified as those considered under the biodiversity descriptors and are further listed in the reporting sheets.

There is no specific mention of the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters in the definition. However, in the accompanying text to the GES definition, Ireland lists the existing regulatory regimes, which will be used to assess GES, including the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85/337/EEC), the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive (2001/42/EC), the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC: Article 6 assessments) and assessments undertaken for the purposes of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), including where necessary the use of models to assess changes in the condition and extent of areas likely to be affected by the permanent alteration.";The GES definition of Ireland for D7 is assessed as partially adequate.

The environmental target addresses all the pressures identified in the initial assessment, however, it seems it is only applicable to new projects and not to existing activities. 

It is not clear if the target and associated indicator defined for Descriptor 7 is sufficient to achieve GES: it will be sufficient if it is demonstrated that Irish waters are at a GES, but not otherwise (i.e. if the IA further demonstrates that due to some existing pressures GES is currently not achieved) since it seems to address only new projects and activities.";;;;
Ireland;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland has set GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor level in the reporting sheet. However, the definition of GES at descriptor level also includes the two criteria defined for D8 in the Commission Decision: concentration of contaminants and effects of contaminants. The definition at descriptor level is not a copy of the Directive and specifies the GES definition of the Directive further by introducing the elements covered by the Decision criteria. 

In the reporting sheet, Ireland specifies that the threshold values to be used as GES boundaries are the Environmental Quality Standards of the WFD and the Environmental Assessment Criteria as agreed by OSPAR. In addition, Ireland also specifies the baselines to be used – the Background assessment concentrations/criteria as agreed by OSPAR – and mentions that these are not relevant for acute spills.

Ireland does not specify which substances or which “organisms, populations, communities and biological processes” potentially impacted are covered by its GES definition. Reference is made to “the most sensitive species” in the definition of OSPAR EACs referred to by Ireland but no information specifies which ones are relevant for the Irish GES definition. It can be interpreted that all substances addressed by OSPAR’s EACs and WFD’s EQS and all biological effects addressed by OSPAR are covered by the Irish definition. The definition mentions the three matrices in which measurements should be made to assess achievement of GES but there is no further specification regarding the application of which method (OSPAR/WFD) in which matrix and how the different measurement methods should complement each other. The accompanying text to the GES definition only provides a general definition of the EACs and the EQS but without further specification of these elements. 

While indicators 8.1.1 (concentration of contaminants) and 8.2.1 (levels of pollution effects) are partially covered by the definition, indicator 8.2.2. (occurrence, origin and extent of pollution events) is covered by the GES definition only through the impact perspective. ";The definition of GES for D8 by Ireland is considered partially adequate. GES is defined at criteria level and refers to the relevant EU and RSC standards. However there is no detail of the approach that should be used to prioritise conflicting cases. In addition, it should be noted that while OSPAR’s EAC are risk-based (similarly to the EU EQS) and more tailored to marine water assessments than the EQS, the EU requires that OSPAR's EAC provide an equivalent level of protection to that theoretically provided by the EQSD. The GES definition covers two Commission Decision indicators out of three. Acute pollution events can be considered partly covered but only from an impact point of view. There is a lack of specification with regard to substances and biological effects covered by the definition and measurement methods to be used to assess achievement of GES.  ;"- GES definition at descriptor level but incorporates the two criteria of the Commission Decision
- Indicator 8.2.2 (acute pollution events) not fully covered

Ireland;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
The assessment of input loads of hazardous substances from land-based sources into the Irish marine environment is done on the basis of a study on Riverine and Direct (RID) Discharges prepared using OSPAR data from 2010. For sea-based sources, the assessment is based on data from Dredge Spoil Dumping at Sea (DaS) as reported to OSPAR annually under Agreement 2009/3. Finally the assessment of input loads from air-based sources is based on OSPAR’s modelling data for Region III, which includes Ireland and the UK. 

The assessment presents results for cadmium, mercury, lead, copper, PAHs and zinc for non-synthetic substances and PCBs (exact PCBs are specified by Ireland), DDE-pp’, HCB, lindane, a-HCH, BDE-47, dioxins and TBT for synthetic substances. The assessment done by Ireland on contamination of their marine waters by hazardous substances is in general well-detailed, quantitative and specific. Ireland provides a detailed account of the various sources of contamination and the main activities responsible (industry and shipping) and provides quantitative data and qualitative and quantitative trends on input loads from land-, sea- and air-based sources. It should be noted however that no assessment is made of input loads of synthetic substances from land-based sources (riverine inputs) justified by Ireland by the lack of data to support a trend assessment. 

With regard to the level of contamination in the environment, Ireland provides an assessment of the level in water, using WFD assessment methods, and the level in sediment, using OSPAR’s CEMP assessment. The assessment for synthetic substances is rather limited. Ireland mentions that given the low levels of these substances in inshore waters, concentrations of these substances in water are not considered to be of concern for Ireland's marine waters and considers that less than 1% of the assessment area is subject to raised levels of contaminants. For non-synthetic substances, the assessment of the level of pressure in the environment is limited to mercury. The assessment of the level of contamination in functional groups is qualitative and limited to synthetic substances (bioaccumulation).

The assessment of impacts on ecosystem components is made using OSPAR’s CEMP procedure and OSPAR’s EACs for biological effects.  The assessment of impacts for habitats and functional groups is not reported separately in the reporting sheet. 

Clear reference is made to all relevant standards (WFD, OSPAR) and the assessment covers various geographic areas. It is quantitative in that it compares current levels of impact with relevant standards. For non-synthetic substances, the assessment of impacts essentially focuses on shellfish and, using the results of the OSPAR CEMP 2011 assessment, Ireland mentions that for lead, mercury and cadmium few significant trends were noticed. For synthetic substances, Ireland assessed concentrations of various substances (PCBs, pesticides, etc.) in shellfish but in terms of biological effects acknowledged that the only effect it could assess is that of TBT on the reproductive capacity of gastropods. 

In terms of judgement of current status, Ireland has made conclusive judgements in relation to GES for the levels of impacts on functional groups and fish and seafood (in good status with an improving trend for both). However, the description of the status mentions that “it is currently not possible to establish clear contaminant-related cause/effect relationships. These data are not fully assessed as yet and so are not reported in this assessment.” As no threshold values or baselines are reported, it is not clear what the judgement on current levels is based on.

Radionuclides
The assessment of contamination by radionuclides starts with the recognition that there is little contamination from land-based, sea-based and air-based Irish sources. The only substances coming from land-based sources are technetium-99m and iodine-131 (mostly from the medical sector) and from sea-based sources Ra-226, Ra-228 and Pb-210 (from oil and gas installations). Contamination by radionuclides comes mainly from foreign sources. These include discharges from nuclear installations, fallout from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. The substances concerned are Cs-137 and Tc-99. Various geographic areas are assessed. The assessment is mostly qualitative. Ireland makes a very limited assessment of impacts.

In terms of judgement, Ireland states that while the levels of artificial radioactivity in the Irish environment remain detectable, they are low and do not pose a significant risk to human health. It also acknowledges that there are no criteria for what should constitute GES and no maximum regulatory levels for radionuclides in the marine environment. It also refers to OSPAR’s 2010 QSR and the conclusions that the dose rates to marine biota are below the level at which effects at the ecosystem level are likely to occur according to current scientific understanding. The main activities causing the pressure are identified and well-described. Ireland does make a judgement that the current levels of impacts on functional groups and fish and seafood are acceptable, i.e. that status is “good” in relation to GES and that this is improving. However, it is not clear how it reached this conclusion. 

Acute pollution events
Ireland starts its assessment of acute pollution events by stating that there is no definition of what constitutes a significant pollution event. Therefore Ireland has provisionally designed a set of criteria to categorise significant events and has concluded that there have been 5 events from 2006 and 2011. Ireland describes in quantitative details these incidents and the geographical areas where they happened, showing that the distribution is predominantly confined to inshore areas. Assessment of impacts is very limited, confined to ad hoc reporting of oiled birds. 

Ireland does not make a judgement on the level of, and impact from, contamination by acute pollution in relation to GES because of the lack of data and established methods. In terms of plans to address gaps, Ireland only mentions that data obtained from aerial surveillance capability would have been of assistance in evaluating more incidents.";The initial assessment of contamination of Irish marine waters by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered adequate. Ireland provides a detailed account of the sources of pollution, quantified information on input loads, quantitative or qualitative trends. It refers to relevant EU and OSPAR standards. The assessment of impacts and biological effects is more limited. Ireland makes judgements on current levels of impacts from contamination by hazardous substances but it is not clear what it basis its judgement on. ;"- Detailed account of the sources of pollution
- Quantitative assessment of input loads and concentrations in the environment
- More limited assessment of impacts
- Judgements on current levels of contamination by hazardous substances but uncertainty what the judgement is based on";3;Adequate
Ireland;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Ireland has defined a set of three targets, each associated with an indicator, to cover Descriptor 8. The three targets cover all aspects of Descriptor 8 (concentration and effects of contaminants and acute pollution event) except contamination by radionuclides, which is expected at this stage.

Ireland specifies threshold values and baselines for the indicators associated with its first two targets. For Target 1 on the concentration of contaminants, the threshold values used are OSPAR’s EACs and the WFD’s EQS. Target 1 set by Ireland includes a second condition that concentrations of contaminants should not be increasing for the assessment area. In such case, it is important to define the baseline against such increase (or lack thereof) should be measured. Ireland specifies that the baseline to be used for Target 1 is OSPAR’s BACs however no baselines are specified for substances only covered by the EQS. 

Target 2 relates to the effects of contaminants. It starts as a general target, referring to biological effects defined by OSPAR, but the second part of the target reduces its scope to reproductive effects of TBT in marine gastropods. A threshold value is specified for the indicator (OSPAR’s EAC for this specific biological effect) as well as the relevant baseline (OSPAR’s BAC). 

Finally, Target 3 relates to acute pollution events. It is the only target which relates to the control of human activities. It is not as specific as the first two targets as it does not define any threshold values that would allow to measure achievement of the target. However, this target is the operational target defined within OSPAR for acute pollution and its use should therefore ensure a high level of coherence with other OSPAR countries, which will use it. Despite the specification of a relative general baseline (pre-spill conditions in so far as known), the lack of threshold value or quantitative trend in the definition makes the target and associated indicators not measurable. The lack of indicator goes in the same direction. Ireland specifies that such indicator is in development and should be operational by 2018. 

Ireland specifies in the reporting sheets that its targets and indicators are compatible with the WFD chemical classification system and with OSPAR Hazardous Substances Strategy.";The set of targets defined by Ireland to cover Descriptor 8 is considered as partially adequate. The set of targets and indicators is considered SMART. It is measurable and quantified except for one target on acute pollution. It refers to the relevant EU and OSPAR standards and is time-bound. The addition of a second condition in Target 1 is not in line with the GES definition but should ensure that GES is achieved as it is more ambitious than the GES definition itself. The scope of Target 2 is restricted to one biological effect (imposex) and is therefore not enough to achieve GES considering that no such restriction is included in the GES definition. Only Target 3 relates to the control of human activities but it lacks specificity to be fully operational. ;"- Set of targets and indicators considered SMART
- Reference to relevant standards
- Target on biological effects restricted to one effect (imposex)
- One target related to control of human activities but lacks specificity to be operational";2;Partially adequate
Ireland;D8;Consistency ;;"The assessment of pressures and impacts is consistent with the GES definition for D8 considering the lack of specificity of the GES definition and the comprehensiveness of the initial assessment. 

There is an inconsistency between Target 1 and the GES definition as Target 1 requires that concentrations do not increase (understood: even if they remain below regulatory levels). This is more ambitious than the GES however and should therefore not hinder achievement of GES. The inconsistency lies in the fact that the GES definition does not include such provision. 

A second inconsistency relates to the fact that Target 2 restricts biological effects to reproductive impairments because of TBT effects. GES does not mention any such restriction and therefore Target 2 will not be sufficient to achieve GES in relation to biological effects. 

Finally, the addition of Target 3, while probably in line with the approaches adopted by neighbouring countries, is inconsistent with the GES definition as the latter does not include characteristics related to the occurrence and extent of acute pollution events. 
";;;;
Ireland;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Ireland has set GES for Descriptor 9 only at descriptor level in the reporting sheet. The criterion defined in the Commission Decision is only partly integrated in the GES definition as the definition does not refer to the number of contaminants, which exceed the regulatory levels or the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded. 

A footnote is added to the GES definition, which specifies that finfish from aquaculture, diadromous fish and other wild species or stocks that migrated beyond the assessment area are excluded from this definition. As “other wild species” is not further detailed in the GES definition or accompanying text, it can presumably exclude many other fish and shellfish species from the scope of the GES definition.  

The definition of GES makes a clear reference to EU regulation 1881/2006 (as amended, which implies Regulations 835/2011 and 1259/2011) and the threshold values are defined as “relevant maximum limits set in EU Regulation 1881/2006 (as amended)”. The definition refers to fish and other seafood “caught or harvested”, which does not cover aquaculture activities. This is however in line with the Commission Decision which refers to species “caught or harvested in the wild”. Ireland has not further specified which substances are addressed by the GES definition but as it makes a clear reference to Regulation 1881/2006, it can be extrapolated that all substances included in the Regulation are covered by the GES definition. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 9 is considered as inadequate. GES is defined only at the descriptor level, the second part of the Decision criterion (number and frequency) is not at all addressed and its non-inclusion is not justified. The GES definition directly refers to the relevant EU legislation and is as such specific and measurable. However, the addition of a footnote excluding a number of migrating stocks from the scope of the GES definition should be regarded as a major gap, in particular because the exclusion is not strict and leaves an open door to additional species than those named. ;"- GES definition at descriptor level
- Only partial coverage of criterion 9.1 (no mention of frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded)
- Reference to relevant standards (Regulation 1881/2006)
- Exclusion of migratory species from the scope of the GES is seen as major gap";1;Inadequate
Ireland;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Ireland has not reported in the reporting sheet on the impacts of contamination by hazardous substances on fish and seafood. However in its general assessment on impacts from non-synthetic substances on functional groups, Ireland makes an assessment of impacts on shellfish in reference to Directive 2006/113/EC (shellfish waters) and an assessment of impacts on fish and seafood in reference to Regulation 1881/2006. In particular, using OSPAR CEMP data, Ireland has assessed that only 2 sites out of 38 exceeded the EC maximum limits for lead in shellfish and in bivalve molluscs. 

On the basis of this assessment, Ireland also makes a positive judgement on the current level of impacts in relation to GES and provides a trend in status (improving). However, it also states that it is currently not possible to establish clear contaminant-related cause/effect relationships, which makes it difficult to understand on which basis Ireland makes its status judgement. Such judgement is also made for synthetic substances and radionuclides and it is even less clear what the basis for these are. For radionuclides, Ireland even mentions that there are currently no agreed criteria to determine impacts of radioactivity on functional groups.

Microbial pathogens
Ireland has reported on microbial pathogens. The assessment covers bathing and shellfish waters. Impacts from microbial pathogens and the main causes for pressure (urban wastewater treatment and agricultural runoff) are identified. There is a presentation of the level of pressures on bathing water, and a judgement (high quality of bathing waters). The trend is considered as stable. With regard to shellfish waters, Ireland considers that in the absence of mandatory levels set by the Shellfish Waters Directive, it is difficult to judge the pressure status. It notes that microbial pathogens are currently considered to be a significant pressure in bivalve shellfish waters. There is no judgement on the trend. Plans to address knowledge gaps are only an indication of possible ways to obtain a more reliable and comprehensible assessment, but there is no firm commitment. 

Finally, Ireland provides extensive explanations on assessment limitations and data/knowledge gaps. In particular, Ireland notes that the assessment is only representative of microbial pathogens in near-shore waters and that it would be important to also understand the contribution of offshore marine-based activities.";The initial assessment of the contamination by hazardous substances of fish and other seafood (including by microbial pathogens) is considered inadequate. Ireland provides very limited information on the current level of impacts on fish and other seafood (only lead and only for shellfish and bivalves). It makes a judgement that current levels are at GES for non-synthetic and synthetic substances and radionuclides, in reference to Regulation 1881/2006, but considering the lack of information on this in the assessment, it is not clear what the basis for these judgements are.;"- Very limited information, only for one substance and two species
- Judgement on current levels in relation to GES (and Regulation 1881/2006) but unclear what the basis of the judgement is
- Assessment of contamination by microbial pathogens but mostly for bathing waters and limited for shellfish waters";1;Inadequate
Ireland;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Ireland has defined one target and two associated indicators to address Descriptor 9. The target and second indicator make clear reference to compliance with Regulation 1881/2006 (as amended) however the threshold value is not as clearly defined as the GES definition as it refers to a “high rate of compliance” with the regulatory levels without further specifying what is considered a high rate of compliance. 

It is assumed that the substances covered by the target and indicators are those addressed in Regulation 1881/2006. The same exclusion applies to the target as to the GES definition and it is sufficiently vaguely worded that it could allow for the exclusion of a number of additional species. A threshold value is only specified for the indicators and it refers to relevant maximum limits set in EU Regulation 1881/2006 (as amended). 

The set of target and indicators is not SMART. It is time-bound, potentially realistic and achievable (in particular considering the exclusion of a number of species from its scope). However, it is not measurable since it is not specified what “high rate of compliance” entails. It is interesting to note that the timescale for achievement of the target is set to December 2012. This would therefore mean that Ireland considers this target already achieved. In such case, the interest of setting such a target is relatively limited as the target should ensure that GES is achieved or maintained if current status is already good. 

The target does not cover indicator 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded, which is in line with the GES definition.   ";The set of target and indicator defined by Ireland to cover Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. While the target/indicators are potentially measurable through their reference to regulatory levels, the lack of specificity of what “high rate of compliance” entails means that it is not possible to actually assess the achievement of the target. ;"- Potentially measurable targets through reference to regulatory levels
- Lack of specificity as to what is meant with “high rate of compliance”";2;Partially adequate
Ireland;D9;Consistency ;;"The assessment of impacts of hazardous substances on fish and other seafood is not consistent with the definition of GES for D9. The assessment is extremely limited, restricted to lead in shellfish and bivalve molluscs, while the GES definition, because it is defined at such a general level, potentially includes all substances addressed by Regulation 1881/2006. However, it should be acknowledged that the lack of assessment on other species than shellfish and molluscs is partially consistent with the fact that Ireland excludes many fish species from its GES definition.

There is consistency between the GES definition and the targets as the same regulatory framework is used for both and the same exclusion apply to certain fish species (the exclusion is equally vague in GES definition and in the targets). However it is doubtful that the target will be sufficient to achieve GES as it refers to a “high rate of compliance” while the GES definition requires all substances to be compliant with regulatory levels.  

Ireland considers that its current levels of impacts on fish and seafood are already at GES, i.e. compliant with Regulation 1881/2006 levels (although how it reached that conclusion is not clear from the assessment). As such, the target defined should ensure maintenance of GES (or improvement to an even better status). However, the target is less ambitious than GES (only “high rate of compliance”) and therefore is not enough to maintain current status. The timescale for the achievement of the target, December 2012, is even more confusing. Clarification may be needed on this point. ";;;;
Italy;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Italy has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at criteria level in the reporting sheets and in the paper report. The definitions of GES in the reporting sheets and in the paper report are not always entirely consistent. Since it is not always clear in the reporting sheets to which sub-region/marine units the GES definitions apply this analysis is based on the paper report. The definition of criterion 1.7 is not included under the definition for D1 in the paper report but under the definition for D4. All criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 1 in the 2010 Commission Decision except for criteria 1.1 and 1.4 are incorporated in the definition. Some of the criteria of the definition of GES are applicable to all three Italian marine sub-regions: the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea, and the Western Mediterranean Sea. Other criteria vary slightly depending on the sub-region to which they apply.

Italy has defined GES for criterion 1.2 (population size) for a range of species: large erect bivalves (Pinna nobilis), seabirds in accordance with the Birds Directive and the AWEA (which means that only listed birds are covered and not all seabirds in general), loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), three species of cetaceans and three species of coastal fish which have been selected as indicators for GES assessment. For seabirds, the threshold value is given as three scores out of six, referring to additional guidelines. No thresholds have been set for sea turtles, probably due to lack of available information. A number of figures are given for fish, which presumably are taken from an established monitoring programme. Fish are restricted to three species, and may (or may not) be limited to coastal areas (it is unclear what is used for farther offshore waters). 

For criterion 1.3 (population condition), appropriate mention is made of genetic variability, and some additional species are mentioned (e.g. tuna, hake and sole). Thus, for species level and criteria 1.2 and 1.3, fish, reptiles, mammals and birds are covered; not cephalopods. It remains to be assessed whether the range of species considered is sufficient to indicate GES on the whole.  

For criterion 1.5 (habitat extent), Italy defined GES to cover Maerl and Rhodolite habitats and also the seagrass Posedonia. Reference point is not given, but the text refers to current conditions or increasing, which is equivalent to 'no further decline'. Current habitat extent is given as the baseline for GES. However, other habitats are missing, such as seafloor sediment types.

The definition of GES for criterion 1.6 refers to the use of multi-metric indices, which are assumingly applicable to seafloor habitats. Reference conditions seem to be set using some form of protected area. Plankton is covered as are elasmobranchs (which belong under 1.3) and (although this is not clear) biologically engineered habitats (such as coral reefs, etc.). Current condition is given as a baseline but it is not clear whether these are already at GES or whether improvements are necessary. Water column habitat types are not described. 

The definition of GES for criterion 1.7, (only reported in the reporting sheets) for ecosystems is left at a general level (but the concept of acceptable deviation from pristine conditions is covered). 

Appropriate references are made to the Habitats and Birds directives and the Water Framework Directive, as well as to the Barcelona Convention.";The GES definition of Descriptor 1 for Italy is partially adequate. The GES definition is not just a repeat of the descriptor text. Due attention is given to the Commission Decision criteria, although some criteria and/or biodiversity components are not addressed and habitat types, functional groups or pressures are not listed. Baseline states seem to be largely based on current conditions but an explanation of where current conditions are in relation to the target state is lacking, as is an evaluation as to what extent current states are degraded or in need of restitution.

Italy;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
In the reporting sheets, Italy has reported only on the following species/functional groups: coastal fish, demersal fish, deep-sea fish, demersal elasmobranchs, and deep-sea elasmobranchs. In the paper report, Italy has reported also on marine mammals. In addition, Italy reported on as series of specific individual species from different species/functional groups, although not on birds, for which it notes that data are still not available. Several areas of assessment within each of the Italian marine sub-regions were used to report on species/functional groups.

The information on most of the groups reported includes a brief description of group condition and relative abundance, their status in relation to the natural status and the main causes of pressure. Judgements on the current status and trends are provided (e.g. the overall status of demersal elasmobranchs in the Western Mediterranean is good and showing an improving trend), as are the criteria, indicators, and baselines (temporal trend obtained by regressing the average values of the Shannon-Wiener diversity index against the period 1994-2011) used for the assessment. The information on individual species usually includes a brief description of the species distribution, population size and population condition. Their status in relation to the natural status and the main causes of pressure are also provided. Trends and conclusive judgements are, however, only provided for some of these species due to the lack of data. The number of species on which Italy has provided information in relation to all the three sub-regions is very large and therefore these individual species are not listed here.

Habitats
Italy has carried out an initial assessment on habitats. The assessment is both qualitative and quantitative, covering both seabed and water column habitats. Italy indicates, however, that the information available is not sufficient to assess the current status of the majority of the habitats reported. The need to carry out more appropriate scientific monitoring is noted, especially with the objective of developing habitat maps and registering the footprint of the main pressures. 

Italy used several areas of assessment within each of the Italian marine sub-regions (two for the Adriatic Sea, two for the Ionian Sea and Central Mediterranean and seven for the West Mediterranean) and reported all their habitats under the category “special and other habitats”. Italy has reported on Maerl beds, Coralligenous beds, Cymodocea beds, Posidonia beds and a series of other seabed and water column habitats types under a national classification, including, Sabbie Fini Ben Calibrate, Detritico Costero, Fanghi batiali, Detritico Infangato and Fanghi Terrigeni Costieri. The list of habitats reported is not comprehensive as, e.g., sandbanks (covered in water), coastal lagoons, salt marshes/meadows, salt steppes and sea cliffs, all of which have been listed by Italy as being of community interest in the Italian interpretation Manual of the habitats (92/43/EEC Directive), biondi et al. 2010, do not seem to have been covered in Italy’s initial assessment. For each of the habitats addressed the information reported in the reporting sheets includes a brief description of the habitat distribution, extension and condition, and the main causes of pressure. For some of these habitats the status of the habitat in relation to the natural status, the proportion of habitat that is altered is also provided. Trends and conclusive judgements on the current status and the criteria (1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6) and indicators used for the assessment are only provided for a small number of the habitats reported. There is no explicit reference to the Habitats Directive or to the habitats listed under the relevant international conventions. 

Ecosystems
In the reporting sheets, Italy has reported on ecosystems at sub-regional level. The information, however, consists exclusively on the identification of knowledge gaps for each of the topics to cover (i.e. ecosystem structure, ecosystem productivity, etc.) and the plans to address them.";The initial assessment by Italy of biological features is considered partially adequate. The information on habitats is qualitative and quantitative and covers both seabed and water column habitat types. In relation to functional/species groups, only fish and mammals are reported on, although most species groups (apart from birds) are represented at individual species level. Trends and judgements on status are provided only in some cases. Italy has not reported on ecosystems but provided a fair amount of detail on the existing knowledge gaps and plans to address them.;"Features:

Italy;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Italy has provided six targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 1which are applicable to all three Italian marine sub-regions. It should be noted that the text is quoted as reported by the Member State although it is obvious that some of it should be considered as accompanying text rather than part of the targets as such. 

In relation to Descriptor 1, the targets are the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report with the exception of the last target (which in the reporting sheets reads: “Urban waste water entering collecting systems shall before discharge be subject to secondary treatment a) for all discharges from agglomerations of more than 2.000 p.e. discharging to freshwater and b) for all agglomerations of more than 10.000 p.e. discharging to coastal waters, in accordance with Article 4 of the Council Directive of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment.”).

The first target focuses on the management and control of fishing practices, for the protection of coastal fish populations. Threshold values are given – “20% increase of meetings and training activity” (but it is not clear what the current practice is) and “meetings with 50% of the existing fishery associations”. Community legislation is mentioned, but it is not clear whether it is/will be implemented. This target could be expected to move from meetings to remedial measures, but this is not specified. It also needs to be stated what the status of the populations are, and what is the aim that this target should achieve in terms of the species distribution, population extent and condition.

The second target focuses on the loggerhead turtle, and has the aim of decreasing accidental mortalities by regulating fishing practices. The target has several components which aim to acquire increased knowledge and to implement regulatory practices (it is not clear whether these practices are already in place). No targets or threshold values are otherwise given. The target is stated as being based on the completion of indicator 1.1.2 (which is not addressed for GES but is included in the initial assessment).

The third, fourth and fifth targets focus, respectively, on reducing mortality of elasmobranchs, reducing mortality of cetaceans, and benthic communities (not clear which species are threatened though, probably the erect Pinna bivalves mentioned in the definition of GES) and illegal harvesting. Community legislation is mentioned, but it is not clear whether it is/will be implemented. Thresholds are given for elasmobranchs and benthic communities, but again relate either to meetings or inspections. As with the first target, it needs to be stated what the status of the populations are, and what is the aim that these target should achieve in terms of the species distribution, population extent and condition.

The sixth target was also reported under Descriptor 5 although slightly differently and is only indirectly related to biodiversity as untreated sewage can negatively impact the seabed, although this specific impact is not addressed by the target. The aim of 90% reported in the paper report seems achievable (although it is not clear when this target must be achieved).

No target relates to seabed or water column habitats. ";The Italian targets for D1 are assessed as inadequate. The targets do not address all components of biodiversity. They focus on some of the species/functional groups covered by the GES definition, but not all. They do not address habitats at all. There are clear targets for improving awareness but a quantitative goal for reducing pressures is not given. In addition, where reference values are given, they refer to current state, but there is no assessment of whether current state is at GES. The targets which relate to increasing the frequency of meetings or inspections are measurable, but they need to be expanded to state measurable goals for the biodiversity. The targets refer to the relevant Community legislation but it is not clear whether it is/will be implemented.;"- Targets that are specific and measurable relate to inspection and training activities 
- Targets focused on reducing the pressure from human activities are not measurable (no threshold values)
- The targets only focus on a limited number of species/functional groups related to those included in the GES definition
- No target on habitats";1;Inadequate
Italy;D1;Consistency ;;"In general, there is a lack of consistency in the definitions of GES and the targets between the paper report and the reporting sheet which complicates the assessment given the lack of certainty on what should be considered as GES and the targets for biodiversity. In general the GES definitions and targets from the paper report were used unless there was an overriding reason to use the reporting sheets. 

In general it can be said that the GES definitions and the initial assessment are very specific in regard to species and habitats of which most are not explicitly referred to in the targets. There is also no specific target for birds while they are part of the GES definition for descriptor 1. This could be due to the fact that Italy has chosen to use operational targets rather than state targets. The operational targets in most cases seem suggestive rather than actual set targets. It could be interpreted that Italy considers the GES definitions to act as state targets. 

For Descriptor 6 specifically there is a lack of coordination between the GES and targets. The GES definition requires that no abrasion of biogenic habitats occurs, the main target relating to abrasion however aims to protect 10% of the seabed from abrasion as the result of fisheries. It is not entirely clear whether this target applies only for non-biogenic habitats and areas which might contain unknown biogenic habitats or the entire area of seabed although the former seems likely. In case of the former situation there is actually no target to protect biogenic habitats from abrasion. The targets for descriptor 6 are therefore not comprehensive for a full coverage of the descriptor. ";;;;
Italy;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Italy has defined GES in the paper report and in the reporting sheet at descriptor and criteria level. The definitions in the reporting sheet are the same as in the paper report. 

The first statement is a GES definition at descriptor level. The others refer to the indicators and criteria of the 2010 COM decision and contain the justification why a more detailed GES definition could not have been defined (lack of information). For the definition of GES, a distinction is not made between the sub-regions of the Italian waters. 

On-going work to assess the impact of marine litter on biota is presented as part of the GES definition. This includes a guideline on litter and biota and the work on a protocol to monitor ingested plastic by loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta through the analysis of stomach content and faecal pellets. Threshold values have not been set as a consequence of the lack of data and will be set after the monitoring programmes have been installed. A reference to OSPAR is given (EcoQO on Fulmars), but not to UNEP/MAP.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 10 is considered as inadequate. The definition is only qualitative and insufficient detail is provided in order to assess if and when GES is achieved.

Italy;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"For all sub-regions, Italy reports that data availability on marine litter is not sufficient to describe the initial status.  Nevertheless, the available data is presented and where possible, an assessment is done.

Adriatic Sea
For the initial assessment, the Adriatic Sea is split in the “North Adriatic” and “South Adriatic” subdivision. For the North Adriatic Sea, data from trawl surveys (seabed litter) are reported. Beach litter is collected in several clean-up campaigns by NGO’s. For the South Adriatic Sea, no data is reported. Data on seabed litter is collected, but not analysed yet. Limited information is reported on the impact of marine litter on marine life. References to scientific publications are given on the ingestion of marine litter by the loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Adriatic Sea. Work is ongoing to develop a protocol to assess ingested litter by Caretta caretta.

Data gaps are listed and literature from other seas is presented, including on the ingestion of plastics by fish, the crustacean Nephrops norvegicus (scampi), the analysis of the plastic derivates in stomachs and the use of biomarkers. For the analysis of the impact of marine litter on marine life, Italy argues that more than one methodology is needed. 

Western Mediterranean
For the initial assessment, the Western Mediterranean is split in the “North-Central Tyrrhenian and Sardinia” and the “South Tyrrhenian Sea”. For the North-Central Tyrrhenian and Sardinia, the main reported information is on seabed litter from trawl surveys.  Data on waste abundance and a composition analysis is reported. Shipping (commercial, fishing, ferry and recreational) are the main sources of waste. Micro-plastics are measured through a standard plankton net in the Cetacean sanctuary “Pelagos”. Beach litter is collected in several clean-up campaigns by NGO’s, though as the amount of marine litter collected, without specification of the type of litter. For the South Tyrrhenian Sea, no data is reported. Data on seabed litter is collected, but not analysed yet.  The data gaps and recommendation on the analysis of the impact of marine litter on marine life in the Adriatic Sea are repeated for the Western Mediterranean

Ionian Sea
The reported information is not specifically targeting the Ionian Sea. ";The reporting for the Western Mediterranean and Adriatic Sea are partially adequate. The available data is concisely presented, as well as first list of data gaps and example publications from other seas. For the Ionian Sea, no specific data is reported. ;"- Available data presented concisely

Italy;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Italy has identified four targets in the reporting sheets and in the paper report. The formulation between the reporting sheet and paper report is sometimes different, but the content is the same. In the paper report, also associated indicators are reported. 

All targets are measurable, but threshold values have not been defined and can only be expected after monitoring programmes have been set up. The first two targets relate to clean-up actions, respectively on the shoreline and on the seabed. The last two indicators monitor the end-of-pipe impact (floating micro-particles and the plastics ingested by sea turtles). 

The sources/pressures of marine litter are not addressed in the targets. Even though the target on micro-particles is intrinsically measurable, it might be difficult in practice and would require a long multi-annual time series.";The targets reported by Italy for Descriptor D10 are partially adequate.

Italy;D10;Consistency ;;A general lack of data is reported, except for seabed litter in the North Adriatic and North-Central Tyrrhenian Sea. Targets cover the need for more waste collection in the marine environment, as included in the GES definition, but not the requirement of to “decrease the contributions”. Targets are linked to clean-up and end-of-the-pipe impacts. The achievement of the targets will lead to a marine environment with less plastic, but does not reduce the inflows. Good practice is the effort related to the development of an assessment methodology and related targets to assess the impact of marine litter on sea turtles.;;;;
Italy;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Italy has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at the descriptor/criteria. The definitions are set at criteria level but they rather read as definitions at descriptor level. 

Each definition focuses on one of the two types of underwater noise targeted in the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision, i.e. loud, low and mid-frequency impulsive sound and low-frequency continuous (or ambient) noise.  Further specification is not given, e.g. threshold values to define what is meant with “at levels that do not adversely affect the marine biota”. 

No reference is made to the criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision. ";The GES definition of Italy for D11 is assessed as inadequate. The Italian definition is similar to GES definition of the 2010 Commission Decision, though without further specification.;"- GES definition is very similar to the definition of the 2010 Commission Decision

Italy aims to achieve GES for Descriptor 11 by means of regulating the anthropogenic activities that introduce underwater sound. The recommendation of the Technical Sub Group (TSG) Noise to setup a noise registry for loud, medium and low frequency impulsive sounds (indicator 11.1.1) is mentioned, but without engagement to setup a noise registry. The text is also confusing with respect to the combination of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), typically project specific at small scale and the noise registry, to developed at large scale. ";Not reported.;- Not reported;0;Not reported
Italy;D11;Consistency ;;The reported information on Descriptor 11 is limited. An initial assessment has not been done. GES is defined at Descriptor level, but without further specification. Targets have not been set. ;;;;
Italy;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The definition of GES for Descriptor 2 is the same for all sub-regions. GES is defined only at criteria level. GES is basically about no new introduction or further spreading of NIS in relation to a baseline still to be set. This baseline (threshold value) will be based on ad-hoc monitoring surveys. Hence, the baseline is considered to be the one observed at the end of the initial monitoring surveys in 2018. 

Detailed description of future monitoring to address data gaps are provided, namely:
•	investigations will be carried out on benthic macrofauna and macroflora (possibly fish fauna), of infralittoral hard substrate (or mobile). 
•	the sampling technique is the standard one (withdrawal by scratching, bucket or box corer depending on substrate) and taxonomic analysis in laboratories for the species. For some specific cases, such as invasive species of megabenthos, there could be other techniques of investigation.
•	in each subregion at least two marine areas with a high probability of introduction will be identified (adjacent to port areas and / or sites for aquaculture), and at least two marine areas of control (e.g. MPA, Natura 2000 sites)
•	in any area identified at least two monitoring sites are planned 
•	the frequency of monitoring depends on the taxonomic group, mostly annual or semi-annual
•	As for the assessment of impacts within the definition of BPI, manipulation activities of individual species might be required, to be implemented only twice (once/year over 2 years)

Italy proposes to develop the indicator values mentioned in the GES definition by 2018 through ad hoc monitoring, considering the current data gaps. The survey should be carried out in areas with a high probability of introduction and in areas of ecological interests. It is proposed to make operational only indicators 2.1.1 and 2.2.2, as indicator 2.2.1 is deemed not practical as it requires an extremely high sampling efforts compared to the outcome indication of the impacts and there is no evidence of impacts related to this within the three sub-Mediterranean regions. Italy further refers to the process of ratification by Italy of the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM) (IMO, 2004), while for aquaculture, it mentions Regulation EC 708/2007.";The GES definition for D2 is assessed as partially adequate. The descriptor is set at criteria level. GES is formulated as a status with no increase of yet to be determined indicator values. Therefore, it is not clear if the minimum requirements (no further increase of NIS which have an adverse effect on the ecosystem, i.e. no new introductions of NIS, and where possible no further spreading of them) are reflected before 2018 when the indicator values are determined. ;"- Descriptor set at criteria level
- As GES expressed as a status of no increase yet to be determined indicator values, it is no clear if minimum requirements are reflected before these values are set";2;Partially adequate
Italy;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the reporting sheet ‘inventory of NIS’, Italy has provided a list of 94 NIS for the Adriatic Sea, 96 for Ionian Sea/Central Mediterranean and 117 for the Western Mediterranean, indicating for all of them the predominant habitat or functional group to which the species belongs or is associated, as well as the means of arrival for the majority. However, it should be noted that these figures do not correspond to those in the reporting sheets on pressure, where Italy indicates in 47 NIS for the Adriatic Sea out of which 24 are considered to be invasive; 104 NIS for the Ionian Sea/Central Mediterranean out of which 52 are considered to be invasive and 119 NIS in the Western Mediterranean out of which 58 are considered to be invasive. The paper report includes for each sub-region a map showing the localisation where NIS have been recorded.

In all three sub-regions, the main vectors/pathways of introduction are shipping and aquaculture, and Italy considers that the cumulative number of NIS is growing. No assessment has been done on the level of impact of the pressure on the water column, sea bed or functional groups. The judgement on pressures and impacts is only descriptive and rather limited to specific species. 

The reporting sheet mentions the lack of data on abundance and impacts, as well as on the main introduction vectors and notes that the gaps may be addressed through i) activation of monitoring networks aiming at evaluating the real settlement of non-indigenous species, in particular the invasive ones, and their impact, through a standardized methodology; ii) activation of monitoring systems in marine protected areas where human impact is absent or limited; iii) surveillance actions in areas with high probability of introduction such as harbours and aquaculture sites and control actions on ballast water and fouling, and aquarium trade. Finally, it also indicates that contribution of non-voluntary introductions to NIS pressure should be better understood by a better comprehension of risks linked to aquaculture.";The initial assessment is considered as partially adequate. It appears relatively complete in the light of what can be expected for Descriptor 2. Italy has provided a list of invasive NIS and information on the level of pressure, but no judgement of the status in relation to GES. There is no assessment of impacts. Italy notes knowledge and data gaps and presents proposals to address those. However, these are non-committal.;"- List of invasive species
- Information on the level of pressure
- No judgement of the status in relation to GES
- Knowledge/data gaps identified and proposals to address those but no clear commitment";2;Partially adequate
Italy;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Italy has set one environmental target for Descriptor 2, with one associated indicator. The target is identical for all three sub-regions.

The target itself is geared towards establishing a risk identification tool rather than addressing the risk of introduction and spreading. While early identification of invasive NIS is a key first step in preventing their introduction and spreading, it is far to be sufficient in itself to ensure that no introduction occurs and further spreading is prevented. Italy recognises that this is an interim target which will be further developed by 2018.

The target is relatively specific explaining which areas are at high risk. It is measurable in relation to the associated indicator - territorial coverage of the system, with a threshold value of 50% of the sites at high risk of introduction of NIS due to human activities. However, it may be not fully achievable and realistic given that it requires extensive monitoring, extensive preliminary activities and that, as noted in the paper report, the financial resources necessary to the achievement of the target, have not been identified yet. It is foreseen that there will be identified once the monitoring plans are defined. ";The environmental target is considered as inadequate. It is not fully SMART, in particular it may not be achievable. It is only one interim target which does not address pressures as such but is rather about surveillance and is not sufficiently ambitious to reach GES. ;"- Only one interim target
- Not fully SMART, in particular as may be not achievable
- Relates to surveillance only
- Not ambitious enough to reach GES";1;Inadequate
Italy;D2;Consistency ;;While the assessment has identified particular species and vectors/pathways, the definition of GES remains very general and subject to further development. The target also lacks specification and is only a surveillance target, also subject to further development. ;;;;
Italy;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Italian GES definition for Descriptor 3 has been defined at the criteria and indicator level. All three criteria of the Commission Decision are covered, as well as indicators 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.3.1, while indicator 3.3.3 is also included but only in the paper report. 

It is mentioned that each indicator has a preliminary threshold set at 100% of the stocks but it is mentioned in the accompany text that these thresholds might need to be revised taking into account the CFP reform, the lack of current reference points for Fpa, the uncertainty regarding existing stock assessments, the multispecies nature of Mediterranean fisheries as well as the multi-trophic interaction among species and environmental drivers. Furthermore it is noted that in the context of the Ionian Sea, the Central Mediterranean sub region (GSA16) and the Adriatic Sea sub-region (GSA17 and 18) there are stocks shared between EU and non EU countries which require international cooperation in order to achieve sustainable exploitation.
 
In the definition for criterion 3.1, the section corresponding to indicator 3.1.1 of the Commission Decision has been defined as being achieved when Fcurr is equal to F0.1 or in the case of small pelagics E=0.4 for all commercial species assuming that the preliminary threshold becomes permanent. The Task Group Report on D3 has concluded that F0.1 is an acceptable proxy for Fmsy. The Task Group Report also concludes that E=0.5 could often be a an acceptable proxy for Fmsy, the Italian proxy E=0.4 however results in a lower fishing mortality than at 0.5 and is therefore even a bit more cautious and can be considered in line with the Commission Decision. The second part of the definition for criterion 3.1 corresponds to the secondary indicator 3.1.2 of the Commission Decision and requires that catch biomass indices remain stable or decrease, which is in line with the Commission Decision. 

With regard to criterion 3.2 both the primary and the secondary indicators have been applied. Assuming that the preliminary threshold of 100% becomes permanent, the primary indicator corresponding to indicator 3.2.1 of the Commission Decision requires that all stocks are at or above SSBmsy or its proxies “such as SSBmsy-trigger, SSBF0.1, SSBpa, etc.”, which is in line with the Commission Decision. This however cannot be fully verified as it is unsure which other reference points might be included due to the “etc.” remark. The secondary indicator corresponding to indicator 3.2.2 of the Commission Decision applies biomass indices and requires them to be stable or have significant positive trends. Setting as a threshold the absence of a degradation trend for indicator 3.2.2 is considered by the Task Group Report as the best option until appropriate reference points are identified and therefore the Italian definition for indicator 3.2.2 is considered acceptable. The reliance on this indicator however does not ensure that stocks are at least at PA levels for all stocks. In relation to criterion 3.2 it should be noted that in the paper report, it is mentioned that the current status of the development of stock assessments at the national level does not allow for the determination of SSB (indicator 3.2.1) reference values (PA, MSY) that could be used for the evaluation of GES, except for stocks of highly migratory pelagic species that are assessed internationally by ICCAT.
 
For criterion 3.3, Italy has applied indicator 3.3.1 of the Commission Decision in both the paper report and reporting sheets and indicator 3.3.3 of the Commission Decision only in the paper report. The indicators have been set so that they need to show stable or significant positive trends, this goes beyond guidance from the commission which has not provided advice regarding the thresholds for the indicators associated with criterion 3.3. 

Since the descriptor as provided in Annex 1 of the MSFD has not been used and the definitions for criterion 3.2 do not mention that all stocks need to be within safe biological limits, Italy’s GES definition does not require all stocks to be within safe biological limits. ";The Italian GES definition is partially adequate. The Italian GES is defined at criteria level, incorporating various indicators from the Commission Decision, but is not defined at Descriptor level. Both criteria 3.1 and 3.2 have been defined in line with the Commission Decision but to be fully compliant the preliminary threshold of 100% for all commercial stocks should be adopted permanently. For criterion 3.3 indicators 3.3.1 in the reporting sheet and paper report and indicator 3.3.3 only in the paper report have been applied. These have been applied with a threshold requiring that the indicator should remain stable or show significant positive trends for all stocks which can be considered a best practice. ;"- GES is defined at criteria level for all three criteria
- Criteria 3.1 and 3.2 in line with Commission Decision 
- Threshold to exploit 100% of stocks at F0.1 or E=0.4 still preliminary and therefore assumed as not permanently adopted";2;Partially adequate
Italy;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Italy has provided a number of stock assessments in relation to F0.1 for GSA 9 in the Ligurian and Northern Tyrrhenian Seas, GSA 10 in the South and Central Tyrrhenian Sea, GSA 11 in the Sardinia Sea, GSA 17 and 18 in the Adriatic Sea and GSA 16, 15, 15-16, 12-13-14-15-16 and 19 in the Ionian Sea. In GSA 9 all stocks except for one shellfish stock are overexploited, in GSA 17 all stocks but one fish stock are over exploited and for the remainder all stocks are overexploited in relation to reference point F0.1 or Emsy. Therefore only 2 out of 32 stocks are assessed as not overexploited. However a result from the trend analysis of trawl surveys shows increasing trends for both the functional group of demersal fish and demersal elasmobranchs in all GSA regions except for 17. 

The assessment of fisheries pressure for the different GSA regions for various fleet metiers suggests a decreasing fishing pressure although not for all regions or fleets. From the report it was not clear what the codes used to identify the metiers corresponded which prevented a full understanding of the assessment presented. Finally Italy has provided an assessment of GES in relation to the indicators defined in the Commission Decision for fish and shellfish by GSA region, none of the regions achieve the GES. The assessment has not covered impacts on the seafloor and functional groups due to a lack of established methods.";The initial assessment of fisheries in Italy is considered partially adequate. The assessment provides a relevant overview of stocks in relation to relevant reference points (F0.1, E0.4). Additionally the assessment provides an assessment of the trends of fishing pressure and finally has made an assessment of GES in relation to the indicators provided in the commission decision. The assessment has however not covered impacts on the seafloor or on functional groups. ;"- Stocks assessed in relation to relevant reference points (F0.1, E0.4)

Italy;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Italy has reported four targets for Descriptor 3 in its reporting sheets as well as in its paper report. The targets used in the present report are those from the reporting sheets, as they are the most recent version submitted to the Commission.  The targets are aimed at introducing new regulations and management measures or following the prescriptions that will result from the CFP reform in order to reduce specific pressures. It is not clear how these targets will achieve GES as defined for Article 9, and the targets do not include state objectives (e.g. stocks at SSBmsy) or indicators. 

Target T1 states that Italy will apply the recommendations that arise from the CFP reform as well as prescriptions from ICCAT for over exploited stocks, as an interim operational target. This target is not specifically aimed at achieving the objectives of the MSFD

Target T2 deals with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUUF). The target prescribes both a reduction of the pressure from IUUF as well as the increased knowledge on the topic by 2018. It is unclear what level of reduction of IUUF should be achieved which means that the target is not SMART. 

Target T3 is aimed at creating a regulation for recreational fishing and making a first assessment of its impacts. The target explains what the regulation should take into account but it is not indicated whether the regulations might result in a pressure reduction on fish stocks.  The target can lead to improved fisheries management but there is currently no indication on how it might contribute to achieving GES by 2020. 

TargetT4 aims to set up minimum landing sizes for certain elasmobranch species. This can contribute to a better management of elasmobranch species depending on the actual minimum landing sizes to be implemented and the range of species considered. It is noted that this regulation could contribute to the medium to long term recovery of stocks of selachii. This is therefore unlikely to be achieved by 2020 especially taking into account the slow reproductive strategies of selachii.";The set of targets by Italy is considered inadequate. The targets are aimed at improving general aspects of fisheries management and reducing the fishery pressure on overfished stocks by following the prescriptions that will result from the CFP reform and those provided by ICCAT. The targets do not contain state indicators (e.g. SSBmsy) and none of the targets explicitly aim to ensure that stocks are at least within safe biological limits and not overfished by 2020.;"- Targets set to introduce new regulations, collect knowledge and follow CFP and ICCAT advice
- No state targets
- Unclear whether the targets are sufficient to achieve GES as defined by Italy
- None of the targets aim for stocks to be within safe biological limits";1;Inadequate
Italy;D3;Consistency ;;"Italy, when formulating its GES definition for D3 and carrying out the initial assessment, has used the reference points F0.1 and E/Z=0.4 as proxies for Fmsy and Emsy. The first target as provided in Article 10 also refers to the reference points Fmsy and Emsy but it is clear that Italy will rely on the CFP reform and recommendations of ICCAT to reduce overfishing. 

The targets do not contain state indicators and do not specifically require that any of the stocks are overfished and that they are within safe biological limits. Therefore while the targets as proposed can result in better management of the Italian fisheries it is not certain that they will achieve GES as defined under Article 9 by 2020. It is also unclear what Italy would do if the prescriptions coming from the CFP reform and ICCAT are insufficient to achieve GES as defined for Article 9 of the MSFD.";;;;
Italy;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Similar to Descriptor 1, the assessment is based on the text in the paper report for the same reasons described above. It should however be noted that in the paper report GES for Descriptor 4 has been defined at the indicator level while the GES in the reporting sheets has been reported at the criteria level. The definitions provided in the reporting sheets for the criteria are however identical to those set at indicator level in the paper report. 

The Italian definition for indicator 1.7.1 is an approximation of the Descriptor 4 definition as found in Annex I of the MSFD but deviates in certain areas. The MSFD definition applies to “all elements of the marine foodweb” while the Italian definition applies to the “major ecosystem components” (which is explained by the fact that it is defined for the ecosystem structure (1.7) as well as for D4). In line with the definition of Descriptor 4 in the Annex I of the MSFD, Italy states that the covered components should occur at normal abundances and diversity. However, it does not include the reference to the retention of the “full reproductive capacity.” 

In relation to the criteria, only criteria 4.2 and 4.3 are defined, this means that the concept of productivity has not been used. Italy states that indicator 4.1.1 has not been applied since the species of mammals and birds proposed by the task group for this indicator are specific to the North Sea and are therefore not applicable in the Mediterranean context. However this does not seem an appropriate reason to exclude this indicator as the Commission Decision is not specific in regard to the species to be used and there are key predator species including marine mammals and birds in the Mediterranean that are relevant.

Criterion 4.2 is expressed at the level of the indicator 4.2.1 and will require that the weight of the catch of large fish is a specific proportion of the weight of the catch. This proportion is to be set in 2018. Indicator 4.2.1 is therefore not fully complete at present. The definition for indicator 4.3.1 in the paper report does not make sense as it would mean that GES is achieved when there is no change in the negative state of the key functional groups. The GES definition in the reporting sheet however requires that trends in the abundance or other metrics should not show a significant negative alteration of the status. This would mean that GES is achieved when the current situation is maintained. It is however not clear whether GES is currently achieved and considering that practically all reported stocks for Descriptor 3 are over exploited, it is unlikely that GES can be considered achieved for bony fish and piscivorous fish. The provisional groups to be used for the GES assessment require further clarification in order to become operational, therefore criterion 4.3 should be considered incomplete at this stage. ";The definition of GES for D4 is considered inadequate. Some of the indicators are not completed. The justification given for excluding indicator 4.1.1 is not appropriate. Criterion 4.1 and thereby the concept of productivity has not been included in the GES definition. Criterion 4.3 requires that the current situation remains stable which indicates a low level of ambition and considering the status of fish stocks in Italian waters does not seem appropriate as a definition of GES. ;"- GES defined at indicator level but not all indicators for D4 are covered

Italy;D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Italy has defined one target to cover Descriptor 4. The target for Descriptor 4 is only reported in the paper report. In the reporting sheets, the only target identified as addressing Descriptor 4 is the target related to the Caretta caretta, which has been also reported under Descriptor 1 and is analysed above. 

This target relates directly to the targets reported under Descriptors 1, 3, 5 and 6 (to be identified by 2018), which indicates that Italy assumes that the achievements of these targets will lead to the achievement of GES for Descriptor 4. 

The second sentence of the text is ambiguous. It refers to ‘clearly critical geographic areas’, which are still to be determined, and states that targets should focus on mitigation/removal of the cause of human disturbance which is an overall rule and not specific. The report does not specify to what relates the 100% threshold.";The Italian target for D4 is considered as inadequate as it only recalls the necessity to achieve the targets defined for other Descriptors in order to achieve GES for D4.;- Target only recalls the necessity to achieve targets under other descriptors – no specific target for D4;1;Inadequate
Italy;D4;Consistency ;;"In general, there is a lack of consistency in the definitions of GES and the targets between the paper report and the reporting sheet which complicates the assessment given the lack of certainty on what should be considered as GES and the targets for biodiversity. In general the GES definitions and targets from the paper report were used unless there was an overriding reason to use the reporting sheets. 

In general it can be said that the GES definitions and the initial assessment are very specific in regard to species and habitats of which most are not explicitly referred to in the targets. There is also no specific target for birds while they are part of the GES definition for descriptor 1. This could be due to the fact that Italy has chosen to use operational targets rather than state targets. The operational targets in most cases seem suggestive rather than actual set targets. It could be interpreted that Italy considers the GES definitions to act as state targets. 

For Descriptor 6 specifically there is a lack of coordination between the GES and targets. The GES definition requires that no abrasion of biogenic habitats occurs, the main target relating to abrasion however aims to protect 10% of the seabed from abrasion as the result of fisheries. It is not entirely clear whether this target applies only for non-biogenic habitats and areas which might contain unknown biogenic habitats or the entire area of seabed although the former seems likely. In case of the former situation there is actually no target to protect biogenic habitats from abrasion. The targets for descriptor 6 are therefore not comprehensive for a full coverage of the descriptor. ";;;;
Italy;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Italy has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at criteria and indicator levels, but only in the paper report (no GES for Descriptor 5 has been defined in the reporting sheets). The definition of GES is applicable to all three Italian marine sub-regions: the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea, and the Western Mediterranean Sea. While GES is defined, the definition refers to threshold values which will not be developed until 2018. The justification for this is that further monitoring and analysis of available data are required, particularly since some of the thresholds being developed require 6 years of monitoring data.

All criteria laid out for Descriptor 5 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated. Indicators 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.2.1, 5.2.4 and 5.3.2 are to be used, while indicators 5.2.2 (water transparency), 5.2.3 (abundance of opportunistic macroalgae) and 5.3.1 (abundance of perennial macrophytobenthos) are not, but no justification is provided for that. Transparency is important in determining the euphotic depth, and thus relates to the depth of colonisation of phytobenthos. The definition of GES therefore includes the three high level trophic status criteria (nutrient concentrations, direct and indirect impacts), but requires no monitoring or protection of macrophytobenthos communities.

For MSFD GES to be achieved, the Water Framework Directive coastal water bodies must be at least of 'good quality' for the Water Framework Directive biological quality element 'phytoplankton' (but not ‘phytobenthos’). Furthermore, as the threshold levels of only two of three high level indicators need to be achieved for D5 GES to be achieved under the MSFD, it is possible that discrepancies may arise between waterbodies classified under the MSFD and the Water Framework Directive. It is not clear whether supporting the Water Framework Directive ‘physico-chemical’ or ‘phytobenthos’ quality elements will contribute to GES determination under the Water Framework Directive, but if so they are not used for MSFD purposes.

The Italian approach essentially follows the OSPAR Common Procedure for assessing the trophic status of marine waters, even though their waters are not within the North East Atlantic. Under the Common Procedure no monitoring/assessment of eutrophication impacts on macrophytobenthos is required.";The GES definition of Italy for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition of GES contains reference to all D5 criteria from the 2010 Commission Decision, but no thresholds are provided. While the use of one normative of the Water Framework Directive has been applied as a reference condition for coastal waters, it is still possible that the Water Framework Directive and MSFD classifications may not align correctly for all coastal waters. The GES definition is not sufficiently robust enough to take account of eutrophication impacts on macrophytobenthos communities.;"- The definition of GES refers to all D5 criteria from the 2010 Commission Decision

Italy;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Adriatic and Ionian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea
An initial assessment (relating to five assessment areas) – qualitative and quantitative - has been undertaken, relating primarily to pressures, rather than impacts. The only impacts considered are: 1) nutrient concentrations in the marine environment, but beyond 3 km from land these concentrations are modelled not monitored, requiring validation in the coming years; and 2) chlorophyll concentration data derived from remote sensing imagery. The main causes of the pressure have been identified, but impacts on the seabed or pelagic ecosystems have not been assessed.

All relevant nutrients are included as are simply-modelled estimates of point source loading of organic inputs, but diffuse source-derived organic loads are not considered. Water transparency and impacts on the macrophytobenthos community have not been covered. Data provided on nutrient levels further than 3 km from shore are all modelled, not monitored, but an effort has been made to incorporate all relevant geographical areas. Atmospheric deposition is considered only in terms of that originating from local cities, not from further afield. No judgements are provided on the level of pressure. Because GES thresholds have not yet been established, it is not possible to determine whether eutrophication impacts are considered acceptable or not, but organic loads data are still required for the Western Ionian Sea and Sicily Channel. Organic enrichment of the Northern/Central Adriatic is considered to be improving, while in the Southern Adriatic, the situation is worsening. There is no clear reference to the reports submitted under the Water Framework Directive or to monitoring undertaken under UNEP MAP/MARPOL.

Western Mediterranean Sea
An initial assessment (relating to four assessment areas) has been undertaken, albeit one which is limited by data availability. Pressure data are relatively complete (albeit with a shortfall in riverine BOD loads; also, atmospheric deposition is only considered in terms of that arising from local cities, not from further afield). Impacts on nutrient levels are reported, but details of direct or indirect impacts are unclear. The level of information available, particularly in terms of ecological impacts is inadequate. However, an attempt appears to have been made to include all relevant geographical areas. The assessment includes an estimate of organic material loads, but only those originating from UWWT plants and Italy acknowledges that improved quantification of organic loads discharged into the sea should be further explored. No overall judgements are made on the levels of pressures or impacts, but reference is made to localised eutrophic areas in an otherwise oligotrophic sub-region, with industrial, tourism-related or urban pressures identified as the principal causative agents. There is no clear reference to the reports submitted under the Water Framework Directive or to monitoring undertaken under UNEP MAP/MARPOL.";The initial assessment of Italy for eutrophication is assessed as partially adequate. The assessment covers most pressures but it is rather limited in relation to impacts. The main causes of pressure are reported on and a fair attempt to provide quantification is made.

Italy;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Italy has defined two targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 5, but one of the targets is only applicable to the Adriatic Sea sub-region. The targets are the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report although the text is slightly different and indicators are only reported in the paper report (therefore, the version transcribed in this analysis is from the paper report). The targets are measurable, appear to be realistic/achievable and suitably specific indicators are provided. The targets tackle only a single source of nutrients/organic matter, diffuse sources (including atmospheric deposition) and transboundary fluxes are not considered. 

While TG 34 seems sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of pressure, it is not clear if the same occurs with TG 35. Achievement of TG34 would result in a decrease in nutrient loading from UWWT plants to the marine environment, providing the population equivalents served by those plants do not increase to a large extent. However, the construction of sewerage systems and treatment works with secondary level treatment will only remove some 30-35% of nutrients from the wastewater collected. If this wastewater had previously been treated via septic tanks, a greater proportion of the nutrients would probably have been removed before the treated wastewater reached/was discharged to surface waters. However, if the wastewater had previously been treated at a wastewater plant employing only a primary level process (settlement), an additional 10-15% of influent nutrients would be removed. The upgrading of an UWWT plant from primary level treatment only to also include secondary level treatment would increase BOD removal (from the wastewater) from about 33% to >90%. 

It is not possible to assess if the targets are sufficiently ambitious to reduce the pressure or impact to levels that will achieve GES since little information was provided on eutrophication impacts and GES has still to be defined in quantitative terms.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Italy for D5 is assessed as inadequate. The targets provided are specific, measurable, and probably, achievable and realistic. However, they focus only on one single source of pressures – impacts are not addressed at all, and therefore it is not possible to know if GES will be achieved. The targets are directly linked to the UWWT Directive but, apart from that, there is no direct link to the Water Framework Directive.;"- The targets are specific, measurable, and probably, achievable and realistic but focus only on one single source of pressures

Italy;D5;Consistency ;;"Italy has provided a narrower definition of GES for D5 than that presented in 2010 Commission Decision, so the impacts to be considered are fewer. However, the pressures to be addressed remain the same and the need for improved quantification of those pressures is acknowledged by Italy.

Although the requirement for pressure reduction cannot be quantified at this stage, the targets tackle only urban sources, and they are existing targets, not targets developed for MSFD purposes. The Water Framework Directive RBMP targets are not referred to; neither are Nitrates Directive requirements, nor current plans for the control of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. No reference is made to the protection of marine Natura 2000 sites, if any of these are considered to be suffering from eutrophication. In short, the targets appear to bear little consideration to the overall MSFD target with regard to eutrophication. 

It is likely to be a moderate reduction in pressure from a single source (UWWT plants), but whether this would lead to a reduction in impacts cannot be assessed, based on the information provided. It is not possible to assess if the targets are sufficiently ambitious to reduce the pressure or impact to levels that will achieve GES since little information was provided on eutrophication impacts and GES has still to be defined in quantitative terms.";;;;
Italy;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Descriptor 6 has been defined for indicator 6.1.2 of the Commission decision, criterion 6.1 is therefore covered but criterion 6.2 is not covered by the Italian GES definition for D6. Focusing the GES definition on sealing and abrasion by fishing gear on biogenic substrates is appropriate for criterion 6.1. 

The substrates mentioned are relevant although the assessment cannot guarantee that this covers all relevant biogenic substrates. Furthermore since the GES definition is specific to abrasion by fishing gear other impacts related to abrasion, such as anchor damage, are not covered by the GES definition. Sealing and abrasion by fishing gear on biogenic habitats should be totally absent and thereby provides a clear threshold. 

For non-biogenic habitats the pressure of abrasion originating from fishing gears should not be higher than a still to be determined % of the seafloor surface. This aspect of the GES definition is therefore still incomplete. For non-biogenic habitats sealing will not be considered when assessing GES.

Lastly Italy in the accompanying text states that GES will be achieved by 2024 instead of 2020.";The definition of GES for D6 is considered partially adequate as it does not cover criterion 6.2 and only indicator 6.1.2 for criterion 6.1.

Italy;D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

Italy has carried out a limited initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage. The information is scarce, focused exclusively on pressures and mainly qualitative. The structure and level of the information reported for each of the Italian sub-regions – the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sean and Central Mediterranean, and the West Mediterranean – is very similar and, therefore, will be analysed in conjunction. 

In relation to physical loss, Italy acknowledges the existence of knowledge gaps associated mainly with the lack of geospatial data related to substrate types but notes that there are plans to produce a map of the Mediterranean seabed (referring inclusively to the acquisition of specific monitoring equipment). Italy reports that physical loss occurs exclusively because of sealing, which is mostly restricted to the coastal zones. Italy lists the construction and maintenance of ports, land claim defence and cables and pipelines as the main causes of physical loss and provides the proportion of the area affected by this pressure (less than 1% in all assessment areas). However, no trends or conclusive judgements are reported due to lack of data. Italy proposes to use “a trend status indicator” per reference to the current physical loss to assess status and note that it will only be possible from 2018 onwards.

The data available on physical damage is also limited. In addition to the lack of knowledge on the substrates distribution, already referred to above, in relation to physical loss, Italy acknowledges the lack of data on habitats distribution and for some of the main pressure types (in particular, data related to coastal fisheries). There are some data available for some specific areas but that date is not sufficient to determinate the current status. In any case, the data is sufficient for Italy to identify abrasion related to fishing as the main pressure leading to physical damage; changes in siltation, caused mainly by man-made structures (fisheries, the construction and maintenance of ports and land claim defence) are also referred to as another important pressure. 

The proportion of the area affected by physical damage is provided and varies between 1-5% in the Sicilian Sea and 25-50% in the North Adriatic Sea. No trends are reported but a descriptive assessment of status is provided for the level of pressure in the environment and the impacts on seabed habitats – in all cases it is considered that the status is “not sustainable” because the biogenic substrates were affected by abrasion.

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
Italy has carried out an initial assessment on habitats. The assessment is both qualitative and quantitative, covering both seabed and water column habitats. Italy indicates, however, that the information available is not sufficient to assess the current status of the majority of the habitats reported. The need to carry out more appropriate scientific monitoring is noted, especially with the objective of developing habitat maps and registering the footprint of the main pressures. 

Italy used several areas of assessment within each of the Italian marine sub-regions (two for the Adriatic Sea, two for the Ionian Sea and Central Mediterranean and seven for the West Mediterranean) and reported all their habitats under the category “special and other habitats”. Italy has reported on Maerl beds, Coralligenous beds, Cymodocea beds, Posidonia beds and a series of other seabed and water column habitats types under a national classification, including, Sabbie Fini Ben Calibrate, Detritico Costero, Fanghi batiali, Detritico Infangato and Fanghi Terrigeni Costieri. The list of habitats reported is not comprehensive as, e.g., sandbanks (covered in water), coastal lagoons, salt marshes/meadows, salt steppes and sea cliffs, all of which have been listed by Italy as being of community interest in the Italian interpretation Manual of the habitats (92/43/EEC Directive), biondi et al. 2010, do not seem to have been covered in Italy’s initial assessment. For each of the habitats addressed the information reported in the reporting sheets includes a brief description of the habitat distribution, extension and condition, and the main causes of pressure. For some of these habitats the status of the habitat in relation to the natural status, the proportion of habitat that is altered is also provided. Trends and conclusive judgements on the current status and the criteria (1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6) and indicators used for the assessment are only provided for a small number of the habitats reported. There is no explicit reference to the Habitats Directive or to the habitats listed under the relevant international conventions.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Italy;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Italy has defined three targets for to cover Descriptor 6. The targets for Descriptor 6 are not consistent between the reporting sheets and the paper report (in the reporting sheet the third target covers only the Adriatic Sea, while in the paper report it applies to all sub-regions). 

All three targets provided for Descriptor 6 are interim operational targets and the timescale for achievement should be 2012, which seems to be a mistake, unless the targets are already achieved, in which case they are not very useful for 2020. 

The first target has a focus on increasing controls, presumably to gain knowledge on current practices and status (this should be verified by data on the condition of the benthic habitats – i.e. D6.2, which is not covered by GES), but it is not measurable since no thresholds are provided. 

The second target has a specific aim of having a 10% area which is protected, and is measurable. However, the target could have been more specific in stating how this 10% should be selected (e.g. through MPA designation). It is also not clear what the current condition is and whether some remediation is needed. 

The third target relates to providing and adopting appropriate practices in relation to sealing relating to biogenic substrates.  The target is SMART. It is a good complementary target but lacks ambition as such.";The Italian targets are judged as inadequate. The targets do not address all components of biodiversity. The three targets defined lack ambition, two targets only relate to increasing and improving inspections and the third target lacks specificity on how the area to be protected should be designed.

";1;Inadequate
Italy;D6;Consistency ;;"In general, there is a lack of consistency in the definitions of GES and the targets between the paper report and the reporting sheet which complicates the assessment given the lack of certainty on what should be considered as GES and the targets for biodiversity. In general the GES definitions and targets from the paper report were used unless there was an overriding reason to use the reporting sheets. 

In general it can be said that the GES definitions and the initial assessment are very specific in regard to species and habitats of which most are not explicitly referred to in the targets. There is also no specific target for birds while they are part of the GES definition for descriptor 1. This could be due to the fact that Italy has chosen to use operational targets rather than state targets. The operational targets in most cases seem suggestive rather than actual set targets. It could be interpreted that Italy considers the GES definitions to act as state targets. 

For Descriptor 6 specifically there is a lack of coordination between the GES and targets. The GES definition requires that no abrasion of biogenic habitats occurs, the main target relating to abrasion however aims to protect 10% of the seabed from abrasion as the result of fisheries. It is not entirely clear whether this target applies only for non-biogenic habitats and areas which might contain unknown biogenic habitats or the entire area of seabed although the former seems likely. In case of the former situation there is actually no target to protect biogenic habitats from abrasion. The targets for descriptor 6 are therefore not comprehensive for a full coverage of the descriptor. ";;;;

The structure and level of the assessment, which was carried out at sub-region level, is very similar to all the three Italian marine sub-regions and for this reason they are analysed in conjunction.  Italy indicates that the assessments are based on the reports delivered under the Water Framework Directive and focused on changes in the temperature regime (elevated temperatures) and the conditions of salinity (saline intrusions or alteration). Italy acknowledges, however, that it is not in possession of the data or methodologies to assess the impacts of hydrographical changes on habitats or functional groups or to identify the activities causing changes in the temperature regime.

Italy;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Italy has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at criteria level. In addition, Italy quotes the text of Annex I of the Directive for D8 and the Commission Decision indicators 8.1.1 and 8.2.1. While criterion 8.1 is fully covered by the Italian definition, criterion 8.2 is only partially covered as acute pollution events are not included in the scope of the definition. Italy justifies this by stating that there has been no pollution event between 2006 and 2011 (as well as in the previous period). GES is defined at the level of the subregion (and not at the national level) however the conditions to achieve GES are the same for the three subregions. 

Concentration of contaminants

With regard to criterion 8.1 (and indicator 8.1.1), Italy provides a detailed definition, which is based on compliance with the EQS Directive. Italy refers to a “contaminant group” but does not specify which ones these are. These are presumably those they list for the GES definition. In the accompanying text, it refers to the Initial Assessment for these groups of substances. It is presumed that all contaminants addressed by the EQS Directive and relevant for the Italian marine waters are covered by the Italian definition. The first condition to achieve GES is that contaminant concentrations, indexed and integrated by groups of contaminants, should be lower than the EQS, extended to the open sea. In the accompanying text, Italy mentions that the integration by groups of contaminants means looking at concentration levels (indices) of each substance, including a weighting coefficient according to risk / priority based on Decision 2455/2001/EC (list of priority substances) and then taking the average of the indices of the contaminants that make up a specific group. Italy explains that this integration mechanism, which is a first aggregation rule, is designed to give a margin of tolerance and elasticity to the application of the EQS Directive and to the “all in, all out” principle, in particular taking into account that little is known about the open sea on this topic. However, the weighting procedure is not defined. The objective of 70% of the assessment area has an integrated index below the EQ may not be sufficient. 

In the reporting sheets, Italy reports that the threshold value should be lower than 0 (presumably meaning lower than the reference conditions, i.e. the EQS) with respect to both the integrated index and to each index substances. In the “baseline” field, Italy confirms that the reference condition is represented by the EQS but mentions that it may be possible to define area-specific reference conditions, but does not provide further details. Reference to the EQS and the Water Framework Directive would imply that only concentrations in water and biota are covered since no EQS is defined for sediment concentrations. However, in the accompanying text Italy refers to concentrations in sediment. Since it refers to EQS reported in “national / international regulations”, it is not clear whether Italy also considers national standards that may have been defined for the sediment matrix or whether it also covers other standards, e.g. the OSPAR EAC. 

In addition, Italy has defined as an aggregation rule that 70% of the useful surface for all waters of an assessment area (AA) (for which there is data) should be in compliance with this first condition (i.e. the EQS) and that GES is achieved for the whole subregion when all assessment areas comply with this second aggregation rule.  It is not clear what is meant by ‘useful surface’.

Italy also includes radionuclides in its GES definition. The GES definition addresses radioactive substances 137Cs and 210Po. The GES condition for these radionuclides is that their concentrations in water and sediment are below the levels producing an incremental dose rate to reference organisms equal or higher than the Predicted No Effect Dose Rate. It also specifies that trends in concentrations of radionuclides in the relevant matrices should be within acceptable limits and declining. Italy specifies further that the threshold value is that defined in the ERICA EU project (specified as 100 bq/m3 in the paper report). In the reporting sheets, Italy specifies that the baseline should be the background levels of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides, which is unclear. In the paper report, it mentions that the baseline should be the concentrations of Cs-137 and Po-210 below the limit for which there may cause negative effects on the ecosystem, however this seems to be rather the threshold value than the baseline. It is therefore not clear what the baseline should be to assess that trends in concentrations are declining, as is specified in the GES definition. No aggregation rule at subregional level has been defined for radionuclides. 

Effects of contaminants

With regard to criterion 8.2, Italy refers to bioaccumulation and biological effects (biomarkers) but does not specify which biological effects or which organisms/ecosystem components are covered by the GES definition. As for the groups of substances in 8.1, it may be that the biomarkers are specified in the Initial assessment report. The condition for the achievement of GES is that variation of these compared to their respective controls and thresholds are not significant. It is not clear what “not significant” entails. In the GES definition, Italy specifies that control organisms should come from areas that are in GES with regard to concentration levels. The GES boundary is defined in terms of statistical significance for bioaccumulation (p<0. 05 by t-test for homogeneous variances) and for biomarker. In addition, for biomarker (p) should not exceed the specific thresholds for biological relevance. The use of statistical test for bioaccumulation needs further explanation and is not clear from the text.

As for contaminants’ concentrations, Italy defines an aggregation rule that GES is achieved for an assessment area when at least 50% of the waters (for which there is data) complies with the conditions mentioned above.

Italy has also specified GES for effects of radionuclides. The condition to achieve GES is that the marine ecosystem should be protected from effects on its structure and function from chronic exposure to radionuclides. In terms of threshold value, this means that the incremental dose rate deriving from human activities to reference organisms (from external and internal irradiation) is below or equal to the Predicted No Effect Dose Rate (PNEDR), i.e. 10 µG/h. The baseline comes from the EU ERICA project definition for a generic ecosystem. ";The GES definition for Descriptor 8 by Italy is considered partially adequate. It is rather detailed and specific but a number of specific information is missing (i.e. substances, species or biological effects covered by the GES definition) and it covers only partially criterion 8.2 as acute pollution events are not covered in the GES definition. The justification that no event has occurred in the past years is not considered sufficient as acute pollution events are unpredictable. Italy provides a number of detailed information regarding threshold values and baselines to use to measure the achievement of GES and meets the minimum requirements (compliance with EQS Directive). It also provides aggregation rules to be able to assess when GES is achieved at the level of the subregion. However these are quite low, meaning that GES can be achieved even if a large part of the marine waters do not comply with the GES boundaries. It covers radionuclides, which is considered a good practice. ;"- Only partial coverage of criterion 8.2 (no coverage of acute pollution events)
- Detailed and specific but information missing (i.e. substances, species or biological effects covered by the GES definition)

Italy;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
In the reporting sheets, Italy reports very limited and mostly qualitative information on contamination by hazardous substances. It does not mention the specific substances covered but refers to PAHs for synthetic substances and metals. In terms of sources of contamination, it mentions that land-based pollution comes mostly from licensed plants and riverine inputs while sea-based contamination comes from offshore platforms and air-based pollution from atmospheric deposition for man-made and non-synthetic substances. For synthetic substances, it provides quantitative information on input loads from land-based sources (tonnes/year for 2007 to 2011) in all three subregions. For heavy metals, it also provides this information for air-based sources (in tonnes/m2/yr). In the Adriatic subregion, it mentions that both types of substances (PAHs and heavy metals) show an increasing temporal trend (but no mention of the timescale), probably due to the increasing number of licensed plant. For the other two subregions, the trend is visible for metals but not for PAHs. 

Italy has not reported on the concentration levels in the environment. For heavy metals only it has reported on the level of the pressure in functional groups. It does so by stating, for various functional groups (i.e. demersal elasmobranch, coastal fish and costal, shelf and pelagic cephalopod), the share of the functional group affected by the pressure over a certain period of time (2006 to 2011). The results vary from 0.48 for coastal fish in the Adriatic Sea to 15% for coastal fish in the Mediterranean Central area. 

Italy has not reported on effects of contaminants on ecosystem components. It has not provided a judgement on the current level of the pressure in relation to GES. 

Radionuclides
Italy does not report on the sources of contamination by radionuclides (it only mentions phosphogypsum disposal and the aluminium industry in the Western Mediterranean area as potential sources). It provides a quantification of input loads from 2006 to 2011 for land-based and air-based sources (but without specifying the sources of contamination), expressed in GBq/y.

For concentration levels in the environment, it only refers to measurements for 137Cs in biota for the Central and Western Mediterranean subregions, mention the Mediterranean mussel as one of the species assessed. It reports that levels are generally very low, in any case lower than the limits fixed for food consumption. Italy does not specify what it refers to. While these could be The EU relevant Euratom legislation (944/87/Euratom, 3954/87/Euratom, 2218/89/Euratom), Italy has not quoted these.

Italy does not provide information on effects on ecosystem components nor a judgement on the current level of, and impact from, the pressure. 

Acute pollution events
Italy does not report on acute pollution events, which is in line with its lack of definition on this aspect. ";The initial assessment of contamination of the Italian marine waters by hazardous substances and radionuclides is considered inadequate. Very little information is provided and it is only focused on input loads. Almost no information is provided on concentration levels and no information is provided at all on biological effects on ecosystem components. There is no judgement in relation to GES or any reference to the EQS Directive. ;"- Very limited information provided and only focused on input loads

Italy;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"
In the reporting sheets, Italy has defined two environmental targets to cover D8 and no associated indicators. In the paper report, it is not clear what constitutes the environmental target and what is only a copy from the Directive/Commission Decision. In addition, in the paper report, Italy adds a “qualitative description of the target”, which summarizes the GES definition. 

In any case, it seems that the targets defined by Italy to help towards the achievement of GES are actually expressions of GES. In this sense, they will not be assessed again, as the assessment made under Article 9 is valid for this section too. The targets, along with their qualitative description, are specific and measurable and they seem to be achievable and realistic since the aggregation rules defined by Italy for the GES definition are quite low in ambition. However, the timescale for the achievement of the target is 2012, which is unrealistic and is therefore considered to be an error in the reporting. 

In the paper report, Italy mentions that the targets are less strict than the GES definition (“higher degree of tolerance of number of parameters exceeding the limit values”) and suggest that the targets would therefore constitute a first step towards achieving GES. Since no appropriate timeline is provided, it is difficult to know whether this is adequate. In addition, the qualitative descriptions of the targets seem to be exactly the same as the GES definitions and the aggregation rules seem to be the same too. ";The set of targets defined by Italy to address D8 is considered inadequate. The targets are SMART when taking in conjunction with their qualitative description in the paper report but they are repeat of the GES definition (despite what Italy says in the accompanying text) meaning that it is unclear how they can help towards achievement of GES. They do not address specific pressures or substances.;"- SMART targets but rather expressions of GES than targets to help achieve GES
- No pressure-related target
- Inappropriate timeline for achievement of target";1;Inadequate
Italy;D8;Consistency ;;"Considering the poor level of details provided in the initial assessment, it is not consistent with the GES definition, which is rather specific. In addition, the GES definition refers to “groups of substances” defined in the 2012 initial assessment report and these are not reported in the reporting sheets. Finally, the initial assessment does not refer to the EQS Directive, which form the basis of the GES definition. 

The level of consistency between the GES and the targets is very high since the targets are a simple repeat of the GES definition. ";;;;
Italy;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Italy has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at criteria level. The definition for criterion 9.1 covers indicator 9.1.1. No definition has been provided for indicator 9.1.2 but Italy states that it is covered by the definition for indicator 9.1.1. In the accompanying text, in the paper report, as part of the assessment method, Italy mentions that a deviation of 26% from the average value is acceptable (compared to the typical 20% deviation from average values), which it says constitute the frequency of exceedance. However, this is not understood to be the same as frequency of exceedance of regulatory levels, which should be expressed over a fixed time period. The explanations provided by Italy to explain where the 26% value comes from are not clear.

The definition for indicator 9.1.1 reflects the minimum requirements in that it refers to compliance with the relevant regulatory levels (EU Regulation 1881/2006 and further amendments) and it mentions that this assessment should be done on fish and fishery products originating from Italian marine waters. It defines an aggregation rule that for the subregion to be at GES, 95% of the samples should be compliant with the regulatory levels. 

Italy does not specify the species of fish and other seafood covered by the GES definition. ";The definition of GES for D9 by Italy is considered partially adequate. Italy has defined GES in relation to the relevant regulatory levels and has specified that the samples should originate from its marine waters, which is considered a good practice. However, it has not specified GES for indicator 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded, or at least it has not specified it appropriately (by an expression of number of times over a period of time, rather than possible deviation). ;"- GES defined in relation to relevant regulatory levels
- Specification that samples should come from its waters (+++)
- No adequate coverage of indicator 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded";2;Partially adequate
Italy;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Italy has not made an assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances in the reporting sheets or in the paper report.

Microbial pathogens

Italy has reported on microbial pathogens. The assessment covers bathing waters and shellfish waters, although Italy recognises that the information is incomplete with regard to shellfish waters and described the work needed to address these gaps.

The main sources of pressure are identified as land based activities/industries, in particular wastewater treatment, but also agricultural run-off forestry and emissions and industrial discharges. For all three sub-regions, the level of pressure on shellfish waters is assessed as stable and on bathing waters as improving, referring to the Shellfish and the Bathing Water Directives. The level of impacts on shellfish is characterised as stable for Adriatic and Western Mediterranean – unknown for Ionian Sea/Central Mediterranean. Italy has made an effort to formulate threshold values under Indicator 9.1.2 relating to microbial pathogens. 

While the assessment of contamination of shellfish waters by microbial pathogens is considered as adequate, and the formulation of threshold values as a good practice, the lack of assessment on contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption means that it is not possible to make an assessment of adequacy of Italy’s initial assessment in relation to D9.";Not reported.;- Assessment of contamination by microbial pathogens and formulation of threshold values (+++);0;Not reported

Latvia;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Latvia has defined GES for Descriptors 1 for criteria 1.2 and 1.6. The definition for Descriptor 6 (and more particularly criterion 6.2) corresponds to the first definition for criterion 1.6 and is therefore assessed together with D1. 

All of the definitions are specific to Descriptor 5 Eutrophication and are better dealt with under D5. Only the indicator using the BQI index has a more particular relevance to biodiversity (i.e. benthic habitats and communities). The definition on the biomass of phytoplankton could be considered relevant for water column habitats. There is no holistic definition encompassing all biodiversity elements.  

The thresholds set for the BQI range from 4 to 4.5 depending on the assessment area (see target section for more details), which correspond to a high ecological quality of benthic habitats. The indicators as they are defined can be considered to cover some aspects of the water column and benthic habitat conditions but are more appropriately covered under Descriptor 5.

Latvia;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Latvia has used a mixed approach, reporting on species groups, functional groups and a number of individual species. In the reporting sheets Latvia reported on birds, pelagic fish, demersal fish, zooplanktons, zoobentos, phytoplankton and phytobentos; in the paper report, the information is more detailed and mammals (seals) are also covered. Latvia acknowledges a series of knowledge gaps, namely on the distribution and composition of birds species and on non-commercial fish species, indicating, additionally, that species listed under the Birds and Habitats Directives will be reported on in 2013 in accordance to the reporting requirements of these Directives. 

The information included in the reporting sheets is very limited (or almost non-existent in the case of pelagic fish and demersal fish) and mainly qualitative. It usually includes very brief descriptions on group condition and abundance as well as an indication of the main pressures affecting the species group; in some cases a judgement on the current status is also provided. At individual species level, Latvia reported on the following fish species: Sprat, Eastern Baltic Cod, Herring of the Central Baltic Sea, Herring of the Gulf of Riga and Flounder. For each of these species, Latvia has provided (qualitative and, in some cases, quantitative) information on the species distribution and population size as well as on the main pressures. No trends or conclusive judgements have been provided. ICES is systematically mentioned, but there are no explicit references to HELCOM.

Habitats
Latvia carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the Baltic Sea. The assessment is mostly qualitative and covers a few seabed habitats and water column habitats; in the paper report more information is quantified. 

Eleven habitat types were considered relevant, but only the following six were reported on (three seabed habitats and three water column habitats): shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shallow sublittoral sand, shelf sublittoral mud, marine water: coastal, variable salinity (estuarine) water and marine water: shelf. No scientific justification for not addressing the missing habitats has been provided. However, in relation to the habitats reported Latvia indicates that the lack of assessment on some of the impacts and pressures is due to insufficient scientific information.

For each of the habitats reported, the information includes a brief description of the habitat condition, the state of the habitat compared to the natural state, the proportion of the habitat impacted and the main pressures affecting the habitat. No trends are provided but a conclusive judgement on the current status of the habitat condition is provided in some cases, together with the indicator used for the assessment. Reference is made to the Habitats Directive.

Ecosystems
Although Latvia has reported on two ecosystems in the reporting sheets – the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga –, the information concerns only the main causes of pressure affecting them.";The initial assessment by Latvia of biological features is considered partially adequate. The information is not very detailed and it does not cover all the relevant habitat types and species groups. Judgements on status were only provided in some cases.

The indicators only relate to one part of the GES definition for Descriptor 1 and cover only the quality of benthic habitats. They do not cover all the elements mentioned in the target, which is very general. The target and indicators as defined by Latvia for the biodiversity descriptors are not sufficient to achieve GES by 2020.

Latvia;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"In the reporting sheet, GES is defined at the indicator level for indicator 2.1.1 of the Commission Decision. GES is reached when there no new introduction of NIS, especially invasive. The threshold is hence zero. However, the baseline used to assess GES is not defined although it can be considered as being the current state. GES should be reached for the whole of Latvian marine waters.

The GES definition meets only partly the minimum requirements. It addresses the introduction of new NIS but not further spreading of introduced species. 

In the paper report, the definition is almost similar. However, it targets NIS in general rather than those which have an adverse effect on the ecosystem. Latvia defines an indicator for measuring progress towards GES, but without baseline, this indicator cannot be implemented. ";The GES definition for D2 is considered as partially adequate.

Latvia;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);Latvia has defined GES at indicator level. The indicators correspond to indicators 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of the Commission Decision.

In a background technical document it is suggested that the assessment for Descriptor 3 should be made using all species that make up more than 1% of the catch and Salmon. Therefore Latvia seems to suggest that GES should apply or be assessed for cod, sprat herring, flounder and salmon. ;The GES definition for Latvia is considered partially adequate. Latvia has applied the primary indicators as provided in the Commission Decision for criteria 3.1 and 3.2 and set the thresholds at Fmsy and SSBpa or SSBmsy which is in line with guidance from the Commission, however to be fully compliant these thresholds should apply to all stocks.

All indicators are state/impact based; there are no indicators with regards to pressure reduction. The indicators are specific and measurable but not always achievable and realistic. Both phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll-a indicator thresholds are included, but no explanation is provided, since they are effectively surrogates of each other, albeit that biomass is more closely related to autochthonous organic loading and chlorophyll is more closely related to water transparency. The threshold for winter dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations appear to be exceeded by a large margin in the majority of coastal waters, suggesting that the achievement of these by 2020 is not realistic. Targets regarding impacts on phytobenthos, shifts in floristic composition and dissolved oxygen/organic enrichment are absent.

The indicators are also not sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact. Targets for nutrient and organic emissions from land (perhaps including atmospheric deposition) are not included, neither are targets for organic and/or dissolved oxygen concentrations in the sea itself. It is also not clear why there are two indicators and thresholds presented for phytoplankton density but there are no targets presented for water transparency. In addition, the proposed thresholds appear too vague to have much effect on the growth of opportunistic macroalgae, since they are not pressure-(cause-) directed. 

It is unlikely that the target and indicators provided will allow achieving GES by 2020, especially since pressure-reduction targets are not included. It is possible that the proposed Secchi depth threshold could be complied with, but without further background information on recent historical phytoplankton levels, it is not possible to assess how difficult it would be to meet the phytoplankton biomass/chlorophyll-a thresholds.

The target and indicators reported are not consistent. Changes in the threshold ratios of chlorophyll-a : phytoplankton biomass in different areas of marine water may be explained by differences in the major phytoplankton taxa growing there (chlorophyll-a accounts for 1-2% of the dry weight of most phytoplankton taxa). However, a potential problem arises if the GES threshold for chlorophyll-a is surpassed, but not the threshold for phytoplankton biomass (or vice versa), since they are different facets of the same thing.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Latvia for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The target is a copy of the MSFD GES definition for Descriptor 5 and the indicators and thresholds correspond to the indicators reported as part of GES. Pressures are not addressed at all by the targets. While the achievement of the target/indicators will ensure achieving GES (since they are the same), it seems that Latvia has not made full use of the target as a tool to help achieve GES.;"- The target is a copy of the MSFD GES definition and the indicators and thresholds correspond to those reported as part of GES

Latvia;D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressure and its impacts is partially consistent with the Latvian definition of GES. Macroalgae community status is effectively ignored and although floristic changes are effectively described in terms of benthic to pelagic shifts, the targets and indicators do not effectively enable monitoring of future recovery. Dissolved oxygen status is monitored to some extent at least, since anoxic events are discussed, but dissolved oxygen status is not included as an indicator.

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 does not cover all the different pressures and impacts identified in the initial assessment. The targets and indicators are associated exclusively with phytoplankton biomass and the effects of this on light penetration. Other suitable indicators (e.g. nutrient and organic loads and concentrations) are monitored and should have been framed into MSFD targets, but have not been. Wider ecosystem-based biodiversity, abundance and community health-related indicators are not declared. 

It is possible that the target and associated indicators will lead to a reduction of impacts but not necessarily to a level that would allow achieving GES. ";;;;
Latvia;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Inadequate; 1):

All of the definitions are specific to Descriptor 5 Eutrophication and are better dealt with under D5. Only the indicator using the BQI index has a more particular relevance to biodiversity (i.e. benthic habitats and communities). The definition on the biomass of phytoplankton could be considered relevant for water column habitats. There is no holistic definition encompassing all biodiversity elements.  

The thresholds set for the BQI range from 4 to 4.5 depending on the assessment area (see target section for more details), which correspond to a high ecological quality of benthic habitats. The indicators as they are defined can be considered to cover some aspects of the water column and benthic habitat conditions but are more appropriately covered under Descriptor 5. Furthermore these definitions do not cover most biodiversity components";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Latvia;D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Inadequate, 1):

Latvia has carried out a very limited initial assessment in relation to physical loss and no assessment at all on physical damage for the Baltic Sea. Latvia justifies this due to lack of scientific information and developed and validated methods, indicating that the existing gaps will be addressed in the context of an action programme, but no further details are provided. 

In relation to physical loss, in the reporting sheets Latvia has only indicated the main cause of pressure (solid waste disposal), the main features impacted (turbidity, shallow rock and shallow sand) and the judgement on the current level of impact (good). In the paper report, Latvia provides quantified information, indicating for instance that there are 17 dumping sites of dredged sediments in Latvian territorial sea, 7 in the Baltic Sea and 10 in the Gulf of Riga and that they occupy only 0.11% of the territorial sea. It is also indicated that most sediment is deposited near the large ports of Ventspils, Liepaja and Riga. 

There is no reference to the WFD or HELCOM reports.

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
Latvia carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the Baltic Sea. The assessment is mostly qualitative and covers a few seabed habitats and water column habitats; in the paper report more information is quantified. 

Eleven habitat types were considered relevant, but only the following six were reported on (three seabed habitats and three water column habitats): shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shallow sublittoral sand, shelf sublittoral mud, marine water: coastal, variable salinity (estuarine) water and marine water: shelf. No scientific justification for not addressing the missing habitats has been provided. However, in relation to the habitats reported Latvia indicates that the lack of assessment on some of the impacts and pressures is due to insufficient scientific information.

For each of the habitats reported, the information includes a brief description of the habitat condition, the state of the habitat compared to the natural state, the proportion of the habitat impacted and the main pressures affecting the habitat. No trends are provided but a conclusive judgement on the current status of the habitat condition is provided in some cases, together with the indicator used for the assessment. Reference is made to the Habitats Directive.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Latvia;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Latvia has defined one target for Descriptor 6 in the reporting sheet but has not defined any corresponding indicators in the paper report. The text of the target in the reporting sheet is a verbatim copy of the definition of Descriptor 6 in Annex I of the MSFD. 

The indicators presented under Descriptor 1 are also relevant for Descriptor 6 as they relate to criterion 6.2 on the condition of the benthic community. In particular the use of the BQI index is relevant for indicator 6.2.2. However, even if the indicators reported under Descriptor 1 are taken into account under the target of Descriptor 6, they are identical to the GES indicators and therefore do not constitute appropriate tools to help achieve GES. 

The target as reported in the reporting sheet for D6 is not SMART. It does not address any specific pressures to the seafloor or any particular benthic species, it is not measurable and it is not timebound. ";The Latvian target for Descriptor 6 is considered inadequate.

But that applies only the benthic habitats since it is the only component for which Latvia has defined a target. The rest of the GES definition is not covered by the target indicators. The main text of the target is not consistent with the GES definition since it covers habitats and species in general and is not focused on benthic habitats, as GES is.

There is not consistency between the initial assessment and the GES or the targets definitions.

Latvia;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Latvia has provided a quantitative assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, based on available data. In the paper report, the assessment is supported by a large number of graphs and tables, most of which originate from HELCOM and therefore applies to the whole Baltic Sea and not just the Latvian coast. HELCOM data is extensively used by Latvia to make its assessment. Results from a LIFE project on “Marine Protected Areas in the Baltic Sea within the territory of the east coast of the Gulf of Riga” are also used for contamination of fish and shellfish by heavy metals. 

For synthetic substances, Latvia reports, in the reporting sheet, on air-based sources of contamination, mostly from commercial combustion processes and from the energy industry. It does not report on land-based or sea-based sources of contamination. It assesses dioxins and furans and provides input loads. It provides a quantitative assessment of the concentrations of a number of substances (including lindane, HCH, endosulfan, PFOA, PFOS) in water and other (or the same) substances (such as TBT, PCBs, PBDE, HCBD, PFOS and PFOA) in fish (herring, flounder). Latvia does not describe biological impacts on ecosystem components from contamination by man-made substances. 

The assessment of heavy metals contamination is more detailed than for synthetic substances. All land-, sea- and air-based sources of contamination are addressed. Riverine inputs are described in details, past qualitative trends and input loads are provided for lead, mercury, cadmium and copper. For sea-based sources, Latvia actually reports on oil spills (see next sections). For air-based sources, Latvia provides quantitative trends and input loads of the heavy metals. It also describes the sources of emission in detail, providing the share of each activity responsible for emitting heavy metals (industrial processes mainly). Latvia assesses that 75-100% of its marine waters are affected by pollution by heavy metals but explains that concentrations are decreasing. It also provides an assessment of the level of contaminants in certain fish (in particular the perch). In the paper report, a quantitative assessment is provided on concentrations of heavy metals in sediment made in the areas surrounding the largest harbours. Many tables are also included on the concentration levels of heavy metals in fish muscle in different assessment areas/monitoring stations. 

No assessment of biological impacts on ecosystem components is made in the reporting sheet or the paper report. Latvia does not assess the current levels of concentration and does not make an assessment of current status in relation to GES. This is in line with the fact that it has not defined GES. 

Radionuclides
Latvia has made only a very limited assessment of contamination of biota and sediment by radionuclides in the paper report. It provides concentration levels for 137Cs and 90Sr and historic trends (1995-2006). It mentions that radioactive levels in fish in the Gulf of Riga in 2003 were almost twice as high as pre-Chernobyl levels.

Acute pollution events
Latvia does not report separately on acute pollution events but it does provide a short description of oil spills over the period 2000-2008, giving their total number (127), their origin (vessels, port activities) and their volume (from 0.1 to 1 m3). It also mentions that the occurrence of oil spills has drastically decreased between 2005 and 2008. No assessment of impacts on marine animals is made. ";The assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events from Latvia is considered partially adequate. The information is brief in the reporting sheet but much more extensive in the paper report and it is mostly quantified. It is based for a large part on HELCOM data and on results from LIFE projects. No assessment of biological impacts is made however. No assessment is made of current status in relation to GES but that is explained by the fact that GES has not been defined for D8.

Latvia;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Latvia has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor level. The description covers part of criterion 9.1 as it covers concentration of contaminants (9.1.1), but it does not cover frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded (9.1.2). Latvia acknowledges that it has not defined a specific GES for this indicator.

In its GES definition, Latvia provides the list of substances to be measured to assess GES, the species groups (fish and molluscs) in which they should be measured (but not the specific species) and the values that should not be exceeded. These values correspond to the EQS Directive for certain substances and Regulations 466/2001 and 1375/2001 for others. The EQS Directive is used as reference for the three substances for which an EQS has been set in biota (Hg, HCB and HCBD). For the other substances, Regulation 466/2001 is used as reference. It should be noted that Regulations 466/2001 and 2375/2001 are not valid anymore as they have been repealed by Regulation 1881/2006 and therefore their use as reference levels is not appropriate. However, the values for the substances selected by Latvia are the same as those in Regulation 1881/2006.

The list of substances covers almost all substances included in Regulation 1881/2006 except benzo(a)pyrene.";The GES definition for Descriptor 9 by Latvia is considered partially adequate. Latvia has defined GES for D9 only for one part of criterion 9.1, concentration of contaminants. It provides a list of the substances to be assessed and in which species they should be measured (but does not give the name of the specific species to be used as samples) as well as the values to be used as GES boundaries. However, Latvia does not refer to Regulation 1881/2006 as reference levels. It mentions the EQS Directive for the three substances for which an EQS has been defined in biota and outdated Regulations 466/2001 and 1375/2001 for the other substances.

Latvia;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the reporting sheet, Latvia has not made an assessment of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption. In the paper report, the assessment is combined with the assessment of contamination of the environment in general (see D8 section) and is quite extensive in terms of the concentration levels in fish muscle and shellfish of heavy metals and certain synthetic substances. The substances covered in the GES definition have generally been assessed by Latvia. In the report on the assessment of current status in relation to target values (report Part D), Latvia explains that the level of mercury and cadmium have exceeded the regulatory levels in three assessment areas (South-eastern exposed sandy coast of the Baltic Sea; Moderately open rocky coast of the Gulf of Riga; Transitional waters of the Gulf of Riga), where data is available. However, Latvia specifies that measurements were made in fish liver, where accumulation is higher compared to muscles, and therefore still considers these areas to be compliant. Measurements in fish muscle would be necessary to make a meaningful assessment in relation to regulatory levels. 

In this report, Latvia presents a table showing the measurements made in seven different assessment areas and for the six substances used as indicators for GES. Not all substances were measured in all assessment areas however. It uses a colour code to illustrate the areas where the concentration levels are higher than regulatory levels. The three areas mentioned in the paragraph above are clearly marked as non-compliant for mercury and cadmium. Everything else appears to be compliant, i.e. at GES. The regulatory levels used are the same as those used in the GES definition. In the reporting sheet, Latvia reports one conclusive judgement in relation to GES for contamination of fish and seafood by heavy metals (it is the only judgement made for contamination by hazardous substances in general). Latvia assesses current status as good. It is not clear which aggregation rule Latvia has used to come to that conclusion on the basis of the table presented in the paper report. 

Microbial pathogens
Latvia did not report on microbial pathogens. ";The assessment made by Latvia of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption is considered partially adequate. It is recognized that a good effort has been made by Latvia to provide an assessment of current status, by assessment area and by substance, against GES thresholds. However, the description of the pressure is not clearly distinguished from the general assessment of contamination by hazardous substances of the environment, which makes it difficult to assess which species have been considered. It also means that the assessment is not made in the perspective of human health protection but from a protection of the marine environment perspective, which is different from the objective of D9.;"- Effort made to provide assessment of current status, by assessment area and by substance, against GES thresholds

Latvia;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Latvia has defined one qualitative target for D9 and a number of target values, which correspond to the GES threshold values.

The target is a mere reproduction of the GES definition for D9 in Annex I MSFD. The values are those of EU regulatory levels: the EQS Directive for the first three substances and Regulation 1881/2006 for the other substances. 

The assessment made in the GES section about these regulatory levels applies here as well. Latvia has not defined pressure-related targets (e.g. input-reduction targets). ";The set of target and indicators presented by Latvia for D9 is considered partially adequate. The values are the same as the GES threshold values, which means that achievement of the target will ensure that GES is achieved. However, it also means that the target and indicators have not been used as tools to help achieve GES (e.g. by reducing a certain pressure). Pressure-targets for D9 can be similar to those for D8 (reduction of pollutant inputs from land-, sea- and air-based sources) but no targets have been defined for D8 in the case of Latvia. ;"- Targets and indicators are rather expression of GES than targets to help achieve GES

Latvia;D9;Consistency ;;There is a high level of consistency between the GES definition, the initial assessment and the environmental targets since the same threshold values are used for the three elements.

Lithuania;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Lithuania has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at indicator level in the reporting sheet. In the paper report, there is no definition of GES but only a reference to the MSFD Annex I definition.

The indicators defined by Lithuania do not cover all criteria of the Commission Decision for D1. Criteria 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 on habitats’ distribution, extent and condition are not at all addressed by Lithuania’s GES indicators. No explanation is provided for this gap. 

Species are addressed only through seabirds (criteria 1.2.1a to 1.3.1b) and fish (1.6.1 and 1.7.1). No indicator is included to cover mammals. The seabird indicators 1.2.1a to 1.2.1g focus on a number of specific bird species and include precise threshold values and baselines are provided. In the accompanying text, Lithuania specifies that GES is that the abundance of these listed species does not deviate more than 20% from the average species abundances recorded in 2002-2011. 

Indicator 1.3.1a has been defined by Lithuania because oil is responsible for 25% of seabirds’ deaths. GES is defined as less than 10% of oil-contaminated seabirds. However, Lithuania indicates that the indicator is still under development and is expected to be operational only in 2018. 

Indicator 1.3.1b has been defined because birds’ by-catch in fishing gear has been found to have killed 10-15% of wintering seabirds. GES is defined has the rate of unnatural deaths of seabirds caused by fishing gear. Lithuania provides a threshold value of 3.7 but it is unclear what this represents. As for indicator 1.3.1a, the indicator is still under development. 

Indicators 1.6.1 and 1.7.1 cover the fish community (but no specific species is singled out). Lithuania has defined a GES boundary for the diversity index (between 1.3 and 1.5 catch per unit effort (CPUE)) and for the trophic index (from 3.32 to 3.42 CPUE). Lithuania has also defined reference periods (1998-2008) on which its threshold values are based. The accompanying text is not clear whether these two indicators apply to specific species. It seems to be based on HELCOM’s approach to assess trends in trophic levels but the threshold values of such indices should be species-dependent. In any case, it seems that indicator 1.7.1 would also be an appropriate indicator for Descriptor 4.

Finally, the ecosystem level is not really addressed, except through the first general definition of GES at descriptor level, as Lithuania has only defined a GES indicator for the fish trophic levels in relation to the ecosystem. There are no references to other habitats, functional groups or ecosystem components.

In terms of baselines, Lithuania uses historical time series (from 1988 to 2011 depending on the indicators). Therefore reference conditions are not used in the sense of “prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic (natural) conditions” that are free from anthropogenic influences and seem to refer rather to a degraded state. Only in the general GES definition at descriptor level are prevailing conditions mentioned but it is not certain whether this is part of the official GES definition. 

It should be noted that in the reporting sheet, Lithuania indicates that these GES definitions apply only to coastal and transitional waters (and not to offshore waters). 

No reference is made to existing international, European or regional legislation, agreements or standards.

In the paper report, Lithuania suggests that, under a business-as-usual scenario, GES would not be reached by 2020 for population abundance of wintering birds, seabird by-catch in fishing gear and proportion of beached birds with oil on their plumage but that it would be reached/maintained for the two fish community indices. ";The definition of GES for D1 is considered inadequate. Attention has not been equally given to all the criteria of the Commission Decision and the GES definition seems to apply only to coastal and transitional waters. The approach focusses almost exclusively on marine bird species. Mammals and habitats are not even considered in the GES definition without any explanation provided for this gap. However, it is noted that the attention given to bird abundance is encouraging with specific species indicator provided and concrete GES boundaries. These boundaries could benefit from additional details expanding on baseline definition and placing the given threshold values into context. This would make it easier to fairly assess whether the given figure of 20% is too generous or not. With regard to the fish indices (criteria 1.6.1 and 1.7.1), there is a lack of specification of the stocks/species to which they should apply, which means that it is unclear how the indicators will be measured to assess if GES is achieved.  ;"- GES defined at indicator level

Species/functional groups
In the reporting sheets Lithuania has reported on functional groups, but not on species groups or individual species (although some individual species are mentioned, these are not reported separately). The following functional groups were reported: inshore surface-feeding birds, inshore pelagic-feeding birds, inshore benthic-feeding birds, offshore pelagic-feeding birds, coastal fish, pelagic fish and demersal fish. 

The information included in the reporting sheets is and mainly qualitative, although some parameters are quantified. For each functional group it includes very brief descriptions on group condition and abundance as well as the current state in relation to the natural state and an indication of the main pressures affecting the species group; in some cases the proportion of the group affected, trend and judgement son the current status are also provided. 

Lithuania acknowledges a series of knowledge gaps and describes in a general way the plans to address these. In the reporting sheet, Lithuania acknowledges not reporting on marine mammals and justified by saying that there is insufficient data to report on this species group. 

There are no explicit references to HELCOM or to other relevant international conventions in the reporting sheets. No mention is made of the Habitats and Birds Directive (HBD) and of listed/protected species. Lithuania does not mention whether these species will be reported under the HBD rather than under the MSFD. 

Habitats
Lithuania carried out a limited initial assessment on the habitats in the Baltic Sea in the reporting sheets. The assessment is mostly qualitative but covers both seabed and water column habitats (through a lengthy description in the paper report of the various planktonic and benthic communities). Four habitats have been reported, all under the “special and other habitats” category: Exposed to waves moraine ridges with Mytilus edulis trossulus and Balanus improvisus; Exposed to waves moraine bottom with Mytilus edulis trossulus and Balanus improvisus; Exposed to waves moraine bottom with Furcellaria lumbricalis; Exposed to waves sandy bottom with Macoma baltica. 

For each of the habitats reported, the information includes a very brief description of the habitat distribution, extent and condition, as well as the state of the habitat compared to the natural state, and the main pressures affecting the habitat. The proportion of the habitat impacted, trends and conclusive judgements on the current status are also provided in some cases. Lithuania acknowledges a series of knowledge gaps and describes in a general way the plans to address these.

No explicit reference is made to the Habitats Directive in the reporting sheets, but in the paper report some habitats are referred to as in need of protection under this Directive. However, Lithuania does not mention whether these habitats will be reported under the Habitats Directive rather than under the MSFD. 

Ecosystems
Lithuania has reported on two ecosystems in the reporting sheets – large fish (by length), functionally important target groups and (or) species abundance trends – although almost no information is provided.

In the paper report, Lithuania has made an assessment of current status in relation to GES. For Descriptor 1, it assesses that current status is:
-	Good in relation to the fish community diversity index and the average fish trophic levels 
-	Unstable for the abundance of wintering seabird populations
-	Unsatisfactory for seabird caught in fishing gears and oil-contaminated seabirds

For Descriptor 4, it assesses that the current status is:
-	Good in relation to the fish community abundance index
-	Unstable for the copepods and zooplankton biomass
-	Unsatisfactory for the fish community size index ";The initial assessment by Lithuania of biological features is considered partially adequate. The information is not very detailed and it does not cover all the relevant habitat types and species groups. However an effort is made by Lithuania to provide a judgement on the current status in relation to GES. ;"Features:

Lithuania;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Lithuania has defined one environmental target and a series of associated indicators to cover the three biodiversity descriptors. The overall target, which applies to all Lithuanian marine waters, is a general statement which reads more as a GES definition for D1 than as a target. It is holistic and covers all ecosystem components that are have been reported by Lithuania in its initial assessment (seabed habitats, fish, birds and lower levels marine organisms).

The indicators associated with the target are the same as the GES indicators for D1, D4 and D6 (with identical threshold values and baselines). Their analysis will not be repeated here as it was done in the section on GES. The indicators are all SMART.

The fact that Lithuania has not defined pressure-reduction targets is also relatively consistent with its conclusion that the level of pressure from physical loss and damage is acceptable and that current (and future) status is good for all fish community indices (except abundance). However, it notes that current (and future) status of seabird populations is not so good and therefore could have addressed the pressures on these populations in its targets. ";;;;

In the paper report, limited information is provided. Lithuania mentions the lack of reliable data but refers to a few (dated) studies that have been carried out as well as a 2007 HELCOM marine litter project, which makes an overview of the marine litter problem in the Baltic Sea. The project lists the different types of waste found on the coastline (paper, cans, glass bottles, plastic bags and bottles), the most common type of which is plastic bottles (between 30 and 40% of all waste). Very limited data exist for litter on the seabed and in the water column. Lithuania also mentions that studies have been carried out on the effects of litter on marine animals at the scale of the Baltic Sea, but it is not clear what the exact references of these studies are.

In the paper report, Lithuania dedicates a relatively long chapter to underwater noise. It describes what how noise propagates and what kind of theoretical effects it can have on marine animals, supported by graphs and tables. However it acknowledges that data on the actual effects on organisms in the Lithuanian waters is scarce and only refers to studies done in waters outside of Lithuania (Norway, UK, USA, etc.) 

It provides a semi-quantitative description of the potential sources of underwater noise in Lithuanian waters (underwater explosions, military sonar, pile driving, navigation, dredging and cabling, wind power plants). It describes well the level of the pressure, using graphs and tables (sometimes dated) to illustrate its assessment and for each pressure describes the impacts on marine animals (fish and mammals). However, as mentioned before, the assessment of impacts is made at the level of the Baltic Sea as a whole or refers to studies in other countries and is not focused on animals in Lithuanian waters. 

Lithuania provides a very brief description of other sources of energy than noise and in particular heat and electromagnetic fields from submarine cables. But it bases its assessment on studies from Denmark.  

In the reporting sheet, Lithuania reports that the main activities causing the pressure are ports, fishery and shipping, which is not in line with what is reported in the paper report.

Lithuania;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Lithuania has defined GES for Descriptor 2 at indicator level in the reporting sheet, for two indicators of the Commission Decision (2.1.1 and 2.2.2). In the paper report, there is no definition of GES but only a reference to the MSFD Annex I definition. There is no justification why the third indicator, 2.2.1, is not used (Ratio between invasive non-indigenous species and native species in some well-studied taxonomic groups). 

The first definition relates to abundance of new NIS and applies to all marine waters. It aims at zero introduction ‘every 10-20 years’. This first definition reflects partly the minimum requirements. It addresses the introduction of new NIS but not further spreading of introduced species. In addition, it is not entirely clear what the period 10-20 years refers to. As an assessment has been carried out for 20 years previously (1990-2010), the intention may be to carry out a similar assessment for the next 10 or 20 years. However, Lithuania also mentions that this definition will not be operational before 2018. Therefore, it remains rather confusing without further explanation available. 

While the first definition focuses on the state of the pressure, the second one relates to surveillance and applies to coastal and transitional waters. It refers to the bio-pollution index, in line with the HELCOM approach, and is therefore based on an assessment of the abundance and distribution range of NIS and the magnitude of their impacts on native communities, habitats and ecosystem functioning. It could support an assessment of whether or not the GES as defined in the first definition is reached.";The GES definition for D2 is considered as partially adequate. GES is set for two indicators. The minimum requirements are only partly reflected as further spreading and the current pressure are not covered. In addition, the first definition is not clearly worded. While the first definition is an expression of GES, the second one would serve as an indicator to measure whether GES is reached or not. It uses the bio-pollution index developed under HELCOM. ;"- GES defined at indicator level for two indicators

Lithuania has assessed the level of pressure on the environment as ‘moderate’, with recent (1990-2010) and future (2013-2025) trend as ‘increasing’, referring to bio-pollution levels (BPL) and the assessment undertaken on the basis of the BPL . The impact of the pressure on water column and seabed habitats, and associated communities is also considered as ‘moderate’. In addition, Lithuania recognises that there are some gaps in data/knowledge but without clear plans as to how to address them.

Lithuania is making a judgement on the current status (not good) and the trend as declining which is  in contradiction with the identified trends in the level of pressure characterised as increasing.";The initial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered adequate.

In the reporting sheet, for the coastal and transitional waters, there is one single environmental target, with one associated indicator which is identical to one of the GES definition. With regard to the indicator, the remarks made under GES are equally applicable. The environmental target aims at implementing measures to decrease the risk of new introduction. It is not specific as there is no further specification as to which types of measures should be taken and which vectors/pathways addressed. It is measurable by implementing the associated indicator based on the bio-pollution index. The target is achievable and realistic. It is time-bound as the measures should be implemented by December 2020. However, this is later than the deadline for implementation of the programme of measures due in 2016 at the latest.

For all marine waters, only one indicator has been set, which is identical to the first definition of GES set by Lithuania for these waters. The remarks made under GES are equally applicable.
 
Therefore, there appears to be some confusion between GES definition and environmental target. ";The environmental target and associated indicators are assessed as inadequate. Both indicators simply reproduce the GES definition. The target is not fully SMART as it does not address specific vectors/pathways and, therefore, is not specific enough. In addition, the timeline seems in contradiction with the deadline set by the MSFD for the implementation of the programme of measures.;"- One target and two indicators

Lithuania actively manages four stocks cod, herring sprat and salmon. An overview of the fishing quotas is given as well as the catch 15,538 tons of fish in the Baltic in 2010 which is 42% less than in 2009. Trends in catches are shown from 1991 until 2010. The specific stocks are not assessed in relation to MSY reference points although in relation to GES it is indicated that GES is not achieved for indicator 3.1.1 which implies that at least some stocks are overexploited. Fishing fleets are only described in a very general manner.

In the paper report, Lithuania has made an assessment of current levels of impacts from various pressures on ecosystem components. For selective extraction of fish and shellfish, it concludes that some impacts are observed on planktonic and benthic communities and major impacts are observed on fish indicators (i.e. various indices of the fish community – diversity, size, abundance, trophic – fishing mortality rate, spawning stock biomass, length at sexual maturity, 95th percentile of fish length distribution) as well as on the distribution and abundance of wintering seabirds, by-catch of mammals, birds and non-commercial fish and oil-contaminated birds.

Lithuania;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Lithuania has defined Descriptor 4 at indicator level in the reporting sheets. In the paper report, there is no definition of GES but only a reference to the MSFD Annex I definition. 

The four indicator reported cover the food web both at the lower level by assessing the status of zooplankton and higher level by assessing the status of the fish community. The indicators potentially address all of the criteria for D4 of the Commission Decision but only in a very partial manner, looking only at fish and zooplankton and therefore not addressing food webs in a holistic manner. 

Lithuania has defined a threshold value and a baseline for each indicator but the explanatory/accompanying texts provided do not fully explain how Lithuania has applied these for the assessment of the current status or how these will be applied in the future. The text does not specify to which species/stocks the fish community indices should apply. This means that it is not clear what the threshold values and baselines defined correspond to. 

Lithuania does apply indicators 4.3.1a and 4.3.1b to different assessment areas with different thresholds: territorial waters (excluding coastal), coastal waters, transitional waters.

It is holistic and covers all ecosystem components that are have been reported by Lithuania in its initial assessment (seabed habitats, fish, birds and lower levels marine organisms).

The indicators associated with the target are the same as the GES indicators for D1, D4 and D6 (with identical threshold values and baselines). Their analysis will not be repeated here as it was done in the section on GES. The indicators are all SMART.

Lithuania;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Lithuania has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at indicator level in the reporting sheets. In the paper report, there is no definition of GES but only a reference to the MSFD Annex I definition. All criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision are partially addressed as a number of indicators for each of the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated (but not all). 

In relation to the indicators provided, Lithuania has reported using two assessment areas – coastal waters and territorial waters (excluding coastal and transitional waters) – providing different quantitative thresholds for each of the areas. Indicators not used include nutrient ratios (which may be appropriate), abundance of opportunistic macroalgae, species shifts in floristic composition and dissolved oxygen status. Instead of using abundance of perennial seaweeds and seagrasses, Lithuania uses the maximum depth of macrophyte colonisation. 

The indicators are not fully consistent since there is more than one threshold for many of the indicators presented. This allows the possibility that for the same indicator some thresholds will be achieved, but others will not, e.g. setting GES boundaries for both total nutrients (N and P) and dissolved ‘nutrients (DIN and DIP) could lead to problems if, say, GES is achieved with total nutrients, but not with dissolved nutrients (or vice versa). Similar problems could also exist since thresholds are presented for both summer and annual average nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations. It should be noted that indicators 5.1.1e and 5.1.1f are the same (with identical threshold values and baselines).

The GES definition does not match the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal marine waters and there is no explicit mention to the HELCOM HEAT approach.

In the paper report, Lithuania suggests that, under a business-as-usual scenario, GES may not be reached by 2020 for most indicators (nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations in the water column and water transparency), except perennial seaweed and sea grass abundance which should reach (or maintain) GES by 2020. 
Replacement of the 2010 Commission Decision phytobenthos abundance criterion with one of the depth of colonisation of seagrasses is sensible although it should be noted that the deeper macrophytes or macroalgae can grow, the better the trophic status. Consequently, the GES threshold for depth of colonisation should be presented as minimum rather than a maximum value, as seems to be the case with the Lithuanian indicator.";The GES definition of Lithuania for D5 is assessed as inadequate. Although the Lithuanian government has provided a wealth of targets/threshold values for different areas of marine water, covering nutrient levels, chlorophyll levels, water transparency and the maximum depth of seagrass colonisation, it has not provided criteria/indicators dealing with nutrient ratios, abundance of opportunistic macroalgae, species shifts in floristic composition and dissolved oxygen status. ;"- All criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision are partially addressed as a number of indicators for each of the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated

Lithuania;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Lithuania has carried out an initial assessment on the level of pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. In the reporting sheets, Lithuania used different assessment areas (coastal waters, transitional waters and territorial waters (excluding coastal and transitional waters) and Lithuanian Exclusive Economic Zone) and presented mainly descriptive information, although some quantification is provided. The assessment covers loads (including, where available, the total loads) and concentrations of the relevant nutrients – nitrogen and phosphorus – but not of organic matter. The main causes of pressure are listed and include agriculture, forestry, urban discharges and industry. Trends (always declining) and conclusive judgements (always “not good”) on the overall level of pressure and on level of nitrogen concentrations are reported; trends (always stable) and judgements (always “not good”) on the level of organic concentrations in the environment are also provided but it is not clear on which information these conclusions were based.

The information on impacts in the reporting sheets is almost non-existent or very generic. Lithuania indicates that the water transparency has increased dramatically in the recent years, however, the status is still considered as “not good”, albeit stable. It is also reported that the status of seabed habitats varies considerable across the regions and that 75-100% of the seabed habitats are impacted by eutrophication.

Autochthanous organic material (derived from primary productivity within the sea itself) is not considered as a pressure. Changes in pelagic community composition, including the development of harmful algal blooms are not addressed in the targets, and potential reductions in biodiversity are considered only in terms of the depth of colonisation of macrophytes.

Lithuania;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Lithuania has defined Descriptor 6 at indicator level in the reporting sheets. In the paper report, there is no definition of GES but only a reference to the MSFD Annex I definition. 

The indicators in the reporting sheet are applied to two specific areas: the BQI, which corresponds to indicator 6.2.2 of the Commission Decision, is used to assess all three water types: transitional, coastal and marine waters but the threshold for marine waters is lower than that for the other two types of waters. The transitional and coastal waters are required to be above a threshold of 3.2 which correspond to good quality while the threshold of 2.9 set for marine waters corresponds to a moderate seafloor ecological quality. The use of different thresholds can result in conflicting conclusions about the status of bordering waters under the WFD and MSFD. 

The indicators potentially address the two criteria of the Commission Decision for D6 but very partially. While the BQI indicator is specific and measurable, it is not certain what is meant with the threshold value of indicator 6.1.2 (1). No information is provided on substrate types.  

Indicator 6.1.2 is used only to assess the territorial sea (excluding coastal waters); the indicator requires further development and should become fully operational by 2018.

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

In the reporting sheet, Lithuania has carried out a limited initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage. In relation to physical loss, Lithuania focuses on port construction and dredging, describing in particular the pressure caused by the work related to the expansion of the Klaipeda port. Lithuania indicates that 1-5% of the area assessed is affected by physical loss and considers that the level of pressure is declining and is currently “good”. The impacts of physical loss are also briefly described together with an indication of which are habitats impacted (1-5%) and a judgement on the current level of impact (“not good”).

For physical damage, Lithuania lists the same causes of pressure as for physical loss with the addition of trawling. According to the information reported in the reporting sheets trawling is used to catch more than 95% of the fish in Lithuania. Nonetheless, Lithuania indicates that only 1-5% of the area assessed is affected by physical damage, considering that the level of pressure is declining and is currently “good”. Like for physical loss, the impacts of physical damage are briefly mentioned, together with an indication of which are habitats impacted (1-5%) and a judgement on the current level of impact (“not good”).

There is no reference to the WFD or HELCOM reports.

In the paper report, Lithuania has made an assessment of current impacts from various pressures on ecosystem components. For physical loss and damage (more precisely beach sand replenishment, abrasion, dredging), it concludes that some impacts are observed on benthic communities and some negative biological effects are observed (lysosomal membrane stability and micronucleus induction). Lithuania also makes an assessment of current status in relation to GES. For Descriptor 6, which is most likely to be concerned with physical loss and damage, it assesses that current status is “good” in relation to the extent of the seabed affected by physical pressures and “unstable” for the Benthic Quality Index (BQI).

The assessment is mostly qualitative but covers both seabed and water column habitats (through a lengthy description in the paper report of the various planktonic and benthic communities). Four habitats have been reported, all under the “special and other habitats” category: Exposed to waves moraine ridges with Mytilus edulis trossulus and Balanus improvisus; Exposed to waves moraine bottom with Mytilus edulis trossulus and Balanus improvisus; Exposed to waves moraine bottom with Furcellaria lumbricalis; Exposed to waves sandy bottom with Macoma baltica. 

For each of the habitats reported, the information includes a very brief description of the habitat distribution, extent and condition, as well as the state of the habitat compared to the natural state, and the main pressures affecting the habitat. The proportion of the habitat impacted, trends and conclusive judgements on the current status are also provided in some cases. Lithuania acknowledges a series of knowledge gaps and describes in a general way the plans to address these.

No explicit reference is made to the Habitats Directive in the reporting sheets, but in the paper report some habitats are referred to as in need of protection under this Directive. However, Lithuania does not mention whether these habitats will be reported under the Habitats Directive rather than under the MSFD. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The initial assessment by Lithuania of physical loss and damage is considered partially adequate. The different types and causes of physical loss and damage are documented and reported but the information on impacts is rather limited.

Lithuania;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Inadequate; 1):

Lithuania has defined one environmental target and a series of associated indicators to cover the three biodiversity descriptors. The overall target, which applies to all Lithuanian marine waters, is a general statement which reads more as a GES definition for D1 than as a target. It is holistic and covers all ecosystem components that are have been reported by Lithuania in its initial assessment (seabed habitats, fish, birds and lower levels marine organisms).

The indicators associated with the target are the same as the GES indicators for D1, D4 and D6 (with identical threshold values and baselines). Their analysis will not be repeated here as it was done in the section on GES. The indicators are all SMART.

All targets/indicators are state-based. Lithuania has not defined any pressure-based target/indicators to reduce the pressures on biodiversity (e.g. on the seafloor).";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of targets and associated indicators to cover D1, 4 and 6 is considered inadequate. The overall target is rather an expression of GES than a target as it covers in a holistic, and general, manner all elements considered by Lithuania as constituting its biodiversity. It is not an operational tool that will help achieve GES. The associated indicators are a repeat of the GES indicators, which means that they will not help achieve GES however their achievement will mean GES is achieved. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

";1;Inadequate
Lithuania;D6;Consistency ;;"The initial assessment is only partly consistent with the GES definition. On the one hand, Lithuania has only reported on birds and fish, which are the only species groups covered in the GES definition. It has not reported on mammals or on listed/protected species and has not included them in the scope of its GES definition for Descriptors 1 or 4. On the other hand, it has reported on a number of seabed and water column habitats, which are not at all addressed by the definition of Descriptor 1 or Descriptor 6. 

The overall target for the biodiversity descriptors is also consistent with the initial assessment as it focused only on birds, fish and lower level organisms and seabed habitats. The fact that Lithuania has not defined pressure-reduction targets is also relatively consistent with its conclusion that the level of pressure from physical loss and damage is acceptable and that current (and future) status is good for all fish community indices (except abundance). However, it notes that current (and future) status of seabird populations is not so good and therefore could have addressed the pressures on these populations in its targets. ";;;;
Lithuania;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);Lithuania has not defined GES for Descriptor 7, explaining that as the current changes have not significant impacts there is no need to define GES criteria and thresholds at this stage. ;Not reported.;- Not reported;0;Not reported
Lithuania;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Lithuania has carried out a limited assessment on the level of pressure of and impacts from permanent hydrographical changes, focusing on the near-shore zone. Ports, tourism and the extraction of oil and gas are listed as the main causes of pressure. In relation to impacts, it is stated in one section of the reporting sheets that there are no significant impacts resulting from hydrographical changes, while in another section it is indicated that 75-100% of the environment is affected by this pressure. The assessment addresses impacts both in water column habitats (75-100% impacted) and seabed habitats (25-50% impacted) but in a very general way. Impacts on functional groups also mentioned. No trends or conclusive judgements on the level of pressure of and impacts from permanent hydrographical changed are provided. There is no reference to HELCOM HOLAS.

Marine acidification is not addressed in the reporting sheet but it is included in the paper report. The main causes of acidification at the global and regional scale are described. Lithuania then concludes that there is no impact of climate change or other global anthropogenic pressures on the acidification of the Lithuanian marine waters, even though pH values have increased over the past 20 years. 

In the paper report, Lithuania has made an assessment of current impacts from various pressures on ecosystem components, including changes in salinity. It concludes that some impacts are observed on planktonic and benthic communities as well as on fish. No assessment is made on the current status in relation to GES, which is in line with the fact that Lithuania has not defined GES for D7.";The initial assessment of Lithuania for hydrographical changes is assessed as inadequate.

Lithuania;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Lithuania has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at indicator level in the reporting sheet with the definition of 22 GES indicators. In the paper report, there is no definition of GES but only a reference to the MSFD Annex I definition. The GES indicators in the reporting sheet correspond to the concentrations of various substances in two matrices: water and sediment. No indicator has been defined for concentrations in biota. The GES definition covers criterion 8.1 on concentrations of contaminants but does not cover criterion 8.2 of the Commission Decision on the effects of contaminants on ecosystem components.  The indicators cover all Lithuanian marine waters. 

Concentration of contaminants
The GES indicators defined by Lithuania use an aggregated approach based on the HELCOM’s CHASE method, where a modified average of ratio (concentration divided by threshold) is classified. Each indicator is focused on one specific substance (or group of substances) measured in sediment and in water. One indicator encompasses all priority hazardous substances as well as substances monitored in Lithuania. The other indicators focus on the following substances:
In water:
-	Heavy metals (nickel, cadmium, lead, mercury)
-	Tetrachloro-methane and Trichloro-methane 
-	Di(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate
-	Oil hydrocarbon
In sediment:
-	Heavy metals (nickel, cadmium, lead, mercury, chrome, copper, zinc)
-	PCBs
-	PAHs
-	Oil hydrocarbon

For each substance (or group of substances) Lithuania has defined a threshold value or GES boundary. Lithuania does not provide a reference to existing regulatory limit values (e.g. EQS Directive or HELCOM standards) but reproduces numerical limit values for each indicator. While the units are not provided in the priority field for threshold values in the reporting sheet, they are indicated in the “assessment method” field. 

For concentrations in water, the limit values clearly correspond to the EQS specified in Directive 2008/105/EC. For concentrations in sediment, it seems that Lithuania has used the HELCOM GES boundaries in sediment. However a quick comparison between the values provided by Lithuania as GES boundaries and the values defined by HELCOM as GES boundaries for its core indicators for hazardous substances do not match (e.g. the threshold value for CB-118 defined by Lithuania is 7 µg kg-1 while the HELCOM GES boundary is set at 0.6 µg kg-1; the threshold value for Tributyltin defined by Lithuania is 10 µg kg-1 while it is set at 0.02 µg kg-1 in HELCOM). In addition, Lithuania has defined GES values for a number of heavy metals in sediment (i.e. nickel, chrome, copper, zinc) while there are no HELCOM boundaries defined for these. It is not clear what the threshold values for these substances are based on (e.g. OSPAR EAC). The baselines provided by Lithuania correspond to a time period (2008-2011). Since GES is about the non-exceedance of threshold values, it is not clear what the baseline means and how it should be used. 

Effects of contaminants

Lithuania has not defined GES for effects of contaminants or acute pollution events. Acute pollution is very partially covered through the inclusion of oil hydrocarbons in the list of contaminants to be monitored to assess GES. 

In the paper report, Lithuania suggests that, under a business-as-usual scenario, GES would not be reached by 2020 for levels of concentrations of contaminants in water and in sediment. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 8 by Lithuania is considered partially adequate. It is specific when it comes to the substances to measure and the threshold values to be used as GES boundaries and these reflect internationally-agreed standards (EQS for measurements in water and HELCOM for measurements in sediment). However there are some uncertainties regarding the correspondence between the values used by Lithuania and by HELCOM as GES boundaries. In addition, Lithuania has not defined GES at all for effects of contaminants although certain threshold values used by Lithuania (and by HELCOM) are OSPAR’s EAC, which are developed in an integrated manner taking into account contaminants’ concentrations and their biological effects. Finally, the fact that Lithuania provides the limit values rather than refers to the existing standards (EQS, HELCOM) means that these values will not necessarily change even if the standards are amended by 2020. Therefore GES for D8 may not be compliant with EU and regional standards by 2020.;"- GES defined at indicator level
- Specific substances to measure and threshold values to be used as GES boundaries 
- Reflect internationally-agreed standards (EQS for measurements in water and HELCOM for measurements in sediment) but lack of direct reference to the standards means that Lithuania may not be compliant with EU legislation in 2020 anymore
- Uncertainties on correspondence between values used by Lithuania and by HELCOM as GES boundaries 
- GES not defined for 8.2 except through concentration levels";2;Partially adequate
Lithuania;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
In the reporting sheet, Lithuania reports no information for the assessment of contamination by synthetic substances (apart from judgement on current status – see below). For heavy metals, the assessment is more comprehensive. In the paper report, the assessment of contamination by hazardous substances includes more information as well as supporting graphs and tables. In the paper report, Lithuania provides a description of the different land- (mainly riverine inputs), sea- and air-based sources of contamination and of the different substances relevant for the Lithuanian marine waters. It also describes in details the existing regulatory framework in place since the 1970’s for contamination by hazardous substances with a strong emphasis on HELCOM but also on the Water Framework Directive. 

In the reporting sheet, Lithuania provides a number of qualitative and quantitative trends for the inputs of heavy metals from sea- and air-based sources. It assesses that concentrations of all heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons (measured in 2008-2010) have been found to be higher than the environmental quality standards. This is in line with the judgement made in the reporting sheet that the level of contamination by non-synthetic substances is not acceptable (status is not good) in relation to GES. For synthetic substances, it also makes a judgement that the current levels of concentrations are not acceptable (status is not good). It is unclear what it bases its judgement on. 

In the paper report, Lithuania makes an assessment of current status in relation to GES and confirms the judgement provided in the reporting sheet that current status is not at GES for concentrations of contaminants in water but assesses that levels of concentrations of contaminants in sediment are acceptable. Considering that Lithuania assesses that GES will not be reached by 2020 for concentration of contaminants in sediment, it seems to indicate that Lithuania expects a deterioration of the current status. In the table showing the trends in status, contamination by hazardous substances is shown as decreasing for synthetic compounds and increasing for heavy metals.

No assessment is made in the reporting sheet of the impacts of contamination by hazardous substances (synthetic and non-synthetic) on ecosystem components. Nevertheless Lithuania provides a judgement on the current levels of impacts on seabed habitats and functional groups. For the two groups of substances, it assesses the levels of impacts as not acceptable (not at GES). It is not certain what this judgement is based on. The threshold values provided are those for the concentrations of contaminants. In the paper report, this judgement is confirmed through a number of tables assessing the impacts of certain pressures on ecosystem components. For contamination by hazardous substances, Lithuania assesses that some (limited) impacts do take place on certain marine organisms (zooplankton, seabirds, fish) and that hazardous substances do cause a number of negative biological effects (lysosomal membrane stability; fish disease index; micronucleus induction; abnormalities of burbot and amphipods embryos).

Radionuclides
In the paper report and the reporting sheet, Lithuania describes contamination by radionuclides, starting with the sources of contamination (nuclear and thermonuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, the nuclear industry waste and the 1986 Chernobyl accident, highlighting that the Chernobyl accident is the most important source of contamination in the Baltic). Lithuania assesses concentrations of 137Cs, 40K and 90Sr. In the reporting sheet, Lithuania assesses that the biological effects of ionizing radiation on biota in the Baltic Sea is currently negligible (but highest for 137Cs) and makes a judgement that the level of, and impact from, the pressure caused by radioactive contamination is acceptable (at GES). Lithuania gives a threshold value of 1 mSv/year for the level of pressure in the environment from 137Cs and 90Sr and a value of 10 µGy/h for the level of pressure in functional groups from 90Sr, 54Mn and 60Co. For impacts on ecosystem components, it provides a threshold value of 600 Bq/kg of 137Cs. 

In the paper report, in the table showing the trends in status, contamination by radionuclides is shown as increasing.

Acute pollution events
In the reporting sheet, Lithuania provides limited information on acute pollution events, just mentioning that the occurrence of oil spills in Lithuanian waters is “patchy” and mostly located in harbour areas. It notes that higher oil concentration was associated with the catastrophic oil spill from the tanker “Globe Assimi” in 1981. It assesses that four out of eight functional groups (seabirds and fish) are affected by acute pollution events. In the paper report, it mostly describes the level of emissions of NOx and SOx from shipping in the Baltic Sea and mentions the MARPOL convention but does not describe oil pollution.

In the reporting sheet, Lithuania makes a judgement on the level of contamination by oil in relation to GES (not good) using as a basis the GES boundary defined for PAHs in sediment and oil hydrocarbons in water. In the paper report, in the table showing the trends in status, contamination by hydrocarbons is shown as stable. Lithuania also makes a negative judgement on the impacts from the pressure on functional groups and seabed habitats. This is supported by the assessment made in the paper report of the death rate of birds following oil spills and conclusion that contamination from hydrocarbons does have an impact on wintering seabirds. ";The assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered partially adequate. The level of information provided in the reporting sheet and in the paper report is very inconsistent. However, Lithuania describes in some details, and supported by a number of graphs and tables, the contamination of its marine waters by hazardous substances and its impacts on biological components, based mostly on a collection of results from past studies and from HELCOM. In addition, an effort is made to assess current status in relation to GES. ;"- Inconsistent level of information in the reporting sheet and the paper report

Lithuania;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Lithuania has defined 22 associated indicators for D8 (but no overall target) that correspond exactly to the 22 indicators of GES. The threshold values and baselines for the target indicators reported by Lithuania are also identical to the GES boundaries and GES baselines. The analysis of the threshold values and baselines has been done in the GES part of this chapter and will not be repeated here.

All indicators are state-based. Lithuania has not defined any pressure-target.";The set of (target) indicators defined by Lithuania to cover D8 is considered inadequate. There is no overall target giving a sense of direction as to what the indicators should aim towards.

The target/indicators have not been defined to help achieve GES as they are effectively an expression of GES.  ;"- No overall target giving a sense of direction

Lithuania;D8;Consistency ;;"There is a high level of consistency between the GES definition for D8 and the set of (target) indicators defined by Lithuania since they are exactly the same. However, this seems to indicate rather an inappropriate use of the target as a tool to achieve GES. For instance, Lithuania assesses current levels of concentrations of contaminants in sediment as acceptable (good) but foresees that GES will not be maintained, if nothing is done. Therefore Lithuania should have planned specific targets to ensure that GES will be maintained by 2020 for contaminants in sediment. 

There is consistency between the initial assessment and the GES threshold values as Lithuania seems to be using these values to make an assessment of current status. It is also consistent in a way that Lithuania does not describe in details the sources of contamination and has not set any pressure-based targets to help achieve GES. ";;;;
Lithuania;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Lithuania has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at indicator level in the reporting sheet with the definition of six GES indicators. In the paper report, there is no definition of GES but only a reference to the MSFD Annex I definition. The GES indicators correspond to the levels of concentrations of various substances to be measured in fish muscle tissues (and liver for one substance). The overall GES definition covers only partly criterion 9.1 as it does not cover the number of contaminants which have exceeded maximum regulatory levels and the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded.  

For each indicator, Lithuania provides a threshold value. It does not refer to existing standards for its threshold values (e.g. Regulation 1881/2006) but provides the actual values. A quick consistency check confirms however that the limit values used are those of EU Regulation 1881/2006. 

In terms of substances, the Lithuanian GES indicators cover all the relevant substances included in Regulation 1881/2006, except PAHs. Lithuania does not provide details regarding the fish species to be used for the samples. 

In the paper report, Lithuania suggests that, under a business-as-usual scenario, GES may not be reached by 2020 for contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption. ";The GES definition for Descriptor 9 by Lithuania is considered partially adequate as it requires compliance with the limit values as defined by Regulation 1881/2006. The fact that Lithuania provides the limit values rather than refers to the Regulation means that these values will not necessarily change if the Regulation is amended before 2020 and therefore GES for D9 may not be compliant with EU foodstuffs regulation by 2020. GES is defined only for the first part of criterion 9.1 of the Commission Decision however since there is no reference to the frequency of limit values being exceeded. ;"- Requires compliance with limit values as defined by Regulation 1881/2006

Lithuania;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Lithuania reports on contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption in the reporting sheet. In terms of substances assessed, it considers dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in herring, sprat and salmon muscles for synthetic substances and lead, cadmium and mercury for heavy metals in cod and flounder muscle. The question of the origin of the samples is not discussed. 

It also provides qualitative trends and makes an assessment against permissible levels. It concludes that concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs have been exceeding the regulatory values in a number of fish samples while concentrations of heavy metals have been found to be three times lower than regulatory values. Based on these assessments, it is not clear why Lithuania reports that less than 1% of fish and seafood are affected by contamination by synthetic substances but that 75-100% are affected by contamination by heavy metals. For both groups of substances it assesses current status as “not good” using as threshold values the regulatory values for PCB and for lead, mercury and cadmium as found in Regulation 1881/2006 and in Lithuania’s GES definition for D9.

In the paper report, Lithuania also makes an assessment of current status in relation to GES and confirms the judgement provided in the reporting sheet that current status is not at GES. 

Radionuclides
Lithuania assesses that radiation levels in fish for human consumption have no significant effects in exposure of the population and that concentrations of radionuclides in open water bodies and in sediment are low. It concludes that current status is good and provides as a threshold value 600 Bq/kg for 137Cs. 

Microbial pathogens:
Lithuania has reported on microbial pathogens, based on expert judgement. The assessment is carried out pursuant to Directive 76/170/EEC and Directive 2006/7/EC.

Lithuania indicates that the information is limited as the diversity of microbial pathogens, their distribution pathways and mechanisms (including ballast waters) and levels of impacts have been little studied thus far. However, it does not mention plans as to how to address these gaps. The two main sources of pressure are recreation and urban waste water.

The level of pressure has been assessed for bathing waters. The current status is considered as good and the trend stable. No assessment is provided for shellfish waters, which is justified considering that there is no shellfish aquaculture in Lithuania.";The assessment of the contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption by hazardous substances is considered adequate. Lithuania makes a quantitative assessment of current levels of contamination for all relevant substances included in its GES definition and it makes a conclusive judgement on the current level of the pressure in relation to GES. It includes an assessment of concentration levels of radionuclides, which is considered a good practice.  ;"- Quantitative assessment of current levels of contamination for all relevant substances included in GES definition

Malta;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Malta has defined GES for the biodiversity descriptors at the criteria and indicator level in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, only the general GES statements are provided, the criteria and indicators from the Commission Decision are not provided. Malta has defined GES for Descriptor 1 and Descriptor 6 together, bringing together a mix of the criteria and indicators corresponding to the two descriptors in a single definition. 

Malta has defined GES for Descriptors 1 and 6 through four GES statements:
•	The natural range and extent of marine habitats and species are stable, or otherwise in line with the physiographic and climatic conditions, taking into consideration the sustainable use of the marine environment.
•	The population abundance of key marine species is stable and their population dynamics are indicative of long-term viability.
•	The structure and function of marine habitats ensure their long-term viability
•	The long-term viability of key marine habitats is not compromised by anthropogenic pressures and impacts.

Each GES statement is further specified through a number of criteria and indicators that are verbatim copies of those provided in the Commission Decision. Criteria and indicators provided for D1 and D6 in the Commission Decision are combined for certain GES statements (e.g. on the structure and function of marine habitats). 

All the criteria for D1 are included in the definition except criterion 1.7 on the ecosystem structure. A number of indicators are not included (e.g. 1.1.2 or 1.4.2). All the criteria for D6 are included. A number of indicators are not covered (e.g. 6.1.1). 

The overall definition of GES for D1 and D6 remains at a qualitative level. The criteria and indicators included in the definition are a copy of those of the Commission Decision. They are not further specified through parameters, threshold values or trends. The standalone GES does not contain specific parameters or thresholds and is therefore not measurable. Malta does not specify what species or habitats are covered by the definition, which could imply that all relevant species and species groups (mammals, fish, birds, cephalopods and reptiles) and habitats (seabed and water column) are effectively covered. In two GES statements, Malta refers to “key marine species” and “key marine habitats”, without providing further information as to what these are (i.e. Protected species and habitats? Species and habitats of national interest?) 

However, Malta specifies in its accompanying text that the achievement of GES is tied to the achievement of the environmental targets and therefore that the parameters for the achievement of GES (biological components, thresholds, etc.) are defined in the targets. The targets proposed by Malta cover a number of seabed and water column habitats, a number of bird species, one mammal and one reptile species and a number of fish species. Cephalopods are anyway not covered. 

In the first GES statement, Malta uses a baseline in the sense of reference conditions, i.e. in line with the physiographic and climatic conditions, but adds a condition for the sustainable use of the marine environment. In the other GES statements, Malta refers to the rather imprecise notion of “long-term viability”, with no further specification at criteria or indicator levels. In the first two GES statements, Malta requires that there is no further deterioration in the state of the marine environment (“stable”). 

The definition of GES does not contain any reference to other EU legislation (e.g. the Habitats Directive) or to any regional or international agreements. Protected species and habitats as per the Habitats Directive are not directly referred to (although the term “key” could relate to these). 

In its accompanying text, Malta describes in some detail the reasons why it has not included certain criteria and indicators in the GES biodiversity definition. The main reasons include data gaps, and lack of knowledge as well as lack of assessment methodologies. In terms of future plans, Malta specifies that the monitoring programme will address the data gaps in order to apply the criteria and indicators missing in the next implementation cycle. ";No conclusion section.;"- GES defined for all criteria except criteria 1.7

Malta;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Malta has reported on four species groups (birds, mammals, marine turtles and fish) and some individual species are reported on in the reporting sheets (Caretta caretta, Hydrobates pelagicus, Calonectris diomedea and Puffinus yelkouan). The various species and species groups are described using available research and monitoring data such as the MEDITS surveys for fish. Judgements on the status and trend of group conditions (but not for abundance) have been made for turtles, mammals, demersal elasmobranchii and demersal fish, which are all indicated as being at good status with stable trends. The analyses on which these judgements are based however do not seem very robust. 

Habitats
Malta has produced a separate report for benthic and water column habitats. The benthic habitat reporting ranges from shallow to bathyal habitats. The assessment covers a wide range of habitats but the data provided is mostly of a general data and, where judgements are provided, these are largely qualitative expert judgements. The assessments indicates “good status” for all habitats assessed except for littoral sediment, but the confidence levels of the judgements are low in 66% of cases, 11% moderate and 23% high. The data is often judged as providing an incomplete picture of the situation and status judgements and habitat extents are often based on extrapolated data. Impacts on specific habitats are described in a general fashion without an assessment of the current levels of pressure.

Ecosystems
Malta has not reported at the ecosystem level. ";No conclusion section.;"Features:
- Information is mainly qualitative but covers most habitat types and functional/species groups (although not always in great detail)
- Trends and judgements on status are provided in many cases
- Not all functional groups are addressed
- The ecosystem as a whole has not been assessed";2;Partially adequate
Malta;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Malta has defined 14 proposed targets and three proposed interim targets organized according to the following categories: benthic habitats, water column habitats, seabirds, sea turtles, cetaceans and fish and demersal elasmobranchs. The targets include state, management and knowledge targets. The targets are accompanied by indicators of which 10 are indicated as still having to be developed. Six of the indicators include the word “or” in the texts indicating two different possible approaches for how the indicator might be developed or used. 

The targets for seabirds are the most specific and measurable referring to specific species and setting a threshold requiring the population of several species to remain stable. In regard to habitats, the reference to assessing whether coastal benthic habitats are at “good” status under the WFD potentially allows at least one target for benthic habitats to be measureable. Both for benthic habitats and fish associated with specific habitats, one of the targets requires that the “species composition and/or abundance” remains stable. The concepts of species composition and abundance are however very different and can lead to very different outcomes. The species composition could remain the same even with significantly reduced species abundances. 

The targets in general are not complete, with many aspects still under development and lack ambition as they mostly require the status of the biological components to remain stable or be maintained, except in the case of seabirds for which a number of targets require a reduction in the level of pressure (by-catch, pollution). 

For sea turtles and marine mammals there are currently only knowledge targets, the target for sea turtles has no deadline, the targets referring to benthic habitats are still unspecific referring to areas and habitats to be selected and with indicators only referring to two specific habitats (seagrass meadows and maerl beds), in regard to fish only demersal species are addressed. Combined the targets do not adequately cover the ecosystem as a whole. Lastly in the reporting sheet and for one target in the paper report it is indicated that they should be achieved by 2025 while GES should be achieved by 2020, this implies that these targets are not sufficient to achieve GES by 2020.

Malta;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Malta has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at the descriptor level but in a way that is not comparable to the definition as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. 

The GES definition also does not incorporate the criterion or indicators provided in the Commission Decision. The GES definition requires that litter entering the marine environment declines over time but makes no reference to impacts or concentrations of litter in the different types of marine habitats (e.g. beach, water column, seabed) or marine life. While the GES states that the input of litter should decrease it is not specified by what amounts making the GES statement rather weak. 

In the accompanying text it is also stated that achievement of the current GES is not measurable due to a lack of baseline data and that a lack of data also prevented the application of the other MSFD criteria.

The assessment of litter concentrations refers to various studies as there are no official monitoring programmes. The data provided is quantitative but its coverage and temporal scale is limited, these gaps are well documented by Malta. The assessment also covers the types of litter with the largest component being plastic in all habitats.

Furthermore Malta states that the achievement of their current GES definition will only be possible when adequate knowledge on vectors and pathways is available. 

It should also be noted that the GES definition focuses specifically on invasive non-indigenous species and therefore does not address all non-indigenous species which can be problematic as it is not always known which non-indigenous species will turn out to be an invasive species. The baseline for the GES definition is indicated as being the current situation as it refers to new invasive NIS. ";No conclusion section.;"- GES defined only for criterion 2.1

Furthermore while it is indicated that the initial assessment is not at a high level of confidence it does already contain specific conclusions such as the fact that the documented NIS distribution shows that harbours/port areas are the main points of entry for NIS while such conclusions are not reflected in the GES definition or targets.";;;;
Malta;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Malta has defined GES for Descriptor 3 at the descriptor level but the definition incorporates criterion 3.3 of the Commission Decision. The GES definition remains at a high level and does not refer to the indicators provided in the Commission Decision nor does it cover criteria 3.1 and 3.2. 

Malta, in its accompanying text, states that the qualitative GES definition is based on the management measures put forward in three of Malta’s Fisheries Management Plans. Furthermore the GES definition states that it applies to selected commercial species while GES for Descriptor 3 should cover all commercially exploited stocks to be compliant with the MSFD. 

In addition, the Member State-specific approach by Malta may make it complicated to compare GES in Malta to that in the waters of the other EU Member States in the marine region. ";No conclusion section.;"- The GES definition does not cover criterion 3.1 and 3.2 of the Commission Decision

Malta;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The initial assessment by Malta is comprehensive covering fleets, fish stocks and fisheries impacts. An overview of the fishing fleet is provided by describing the number of vessels in categories. 

First vessels are categorized based on if they are professional fishing vessels operating full time or part time, recreational fishing vessels or auxiliary vessels used in fishing operations. Fleets are also described according to the number of ships within each type such as trawlers, multipurpose ships and within the five traditional types. 

Stocks are described first by the landings for the main targets species, for eight species for which STECF data was available in relation to Fmsy, and finally according to the indicators provided for criterion 3.3 in the Commission Decision. The six sub-regional stocks for which there was data from STECF were all considered over exploited although the Maltese landings never covered more than 3% of the total landings in the sub-region. In the case of pelagic stocks assessed at the regional scale, Bluefin tuna was found to be below the reference target F0.1 value while swordfish were considered slightly overexploited. 

Finally ten species were assessed in relation to the mean size of first sexual maturation (seven teleosts and three elasmobranch species) and the mean maximum length and fish length distribution observed in research vessels were provided. None of the length-based data is accompanied by a judgement of the status or an assessment of the trend but the data provided covers the years 2005 through to 2012. 

No judgement on the level of pressure from fisheries are provided, although is also mentioned that stocks should be judged at regional scale to be meaningful. Impacts from by-catch and impacts on the seafloor are briefly described. ";No conclusion section.;"- Fleets assessed

Malta;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Malta has defined two environmental targets to cover D3. The first target is a close approximation of the Maltese GES definition for Descriptor 3, although it does not refer to criterion 3.3 of the Commission Decision. The target should be achieved by 2020 but its formulation remains rather weak, as it states that the measures should be implemented with a “view to ensure sustainability of the stocks.” Additionally, as with the GES definition, the concept of sustainable exploitation is not explained in relation to MSY. The accompanying text however explains in more detail the targets of the fisheries management plans which are generally SMART (e.g. 20% reduction in fishing effort of the lampara fishery). 

The second target is a broad knowledge target, which is set based on advice from STECF. This target is not SMART. Malta also states that in order for stocks to be managed sustainable in most cases regional targets need to be defined to be effective. ";No conclusion section.;"- Targets not SMART

Malta;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);Malta has not defined GES for Descriptor 4. In the paper report, Malta provides a justification for the lack of definition for Descriptor 4.

Malta;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Malta has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at criteria level. The definition is the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report, but in the paper report, Malta has added the three criteria of the Commission Decision and a number of indicators. 

GES is defined in broad terms but is in line with the definition in Annex I of the MSFD and covers all the criteria laid out for Descriptor 5 in the Commission Decision 2010/477 (nutrient concentrations, direct effects and indirect effects). It is not clear if the reference to biological communities will relate to phytoplankton, benthic vegetation or faunal communities, the latter resulting from reduced dissolved oxygen levels. No indicators are presented.

While baseline conditions have been established for nutrient and chlorophyll-a levels (based on 2012 WFD monitoring of coastal waters), thresholds are not provided. There are also neither baseline conditions nor threshold values for either direct or indirect impacts. It is clear that there is a shortfall in knowledge with regard to marine trophic status monitoring and assessment in Maltese marine waters (as with many other Mediterranean MSs). While Malta appears to have begun to address this issue in terms of its broad definitions, it is not clear what (if any) further information could be offered at this stage.

Since the determination of GES is to be based on WFD monitoring surveys undertaken in 2012, it is very likely that MSFD normative definitions of GES for nutrient and chlorophyll levels will match those of the WFD in coastal waters.

No international approach is mentioned. UNEP/MAP has an outline strategy for monitoring and managing eutrophication in the Mediterranean, but this involves only a screening methodology for assessment purposes. ";No conclusion section.;"- No indicators are provided
- No Thresholds are defined
- The reference to biological communities is unclear to which communities it refers to
- It is inferred but insufficiently specified that the MSFD GES will link to the WFD normative definitions of GES for coastal waters";1;Inadequate
Malta;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Malta has carried out an initial assessment on the pressures and impacts from eutrophication. The assessment is qualitative and quantitative and covers nitrogen and phosphorus, and to a lesser extent organic matter. Silicate is not covered but this is no surprise, since phosphorus is regarded as the primary limiting nutrient, with N:P ratios being most significant in the naturally oligotrophic waters.

Loads and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus are provided; for organic matter only loads are indicated. Although data on nitrogen and phosphorus loading gathered from 2003 and 2008 suggest that the situation worsened substantially during the intervening period, Malta is careful to downplay such conclusions, suggesting that the large increase in terrestrial-derived loads calculated on the latter occasion is due primarily to differences in the quantity and quality of data available. Moreover, due to the construction of new/upgraded municipal wastewater treatment plants since 2008 (completed by 2011) the situation is now likely to be substantially different. Agricultural runoff and marine aquaculture are indicated as the main sources of eutrophication. 
 
The assessment appears to cover all potential impacts (notably with regard to aquaculture impacts) but contains relatively little information. No conclusive judgements are provided, even though there is some information that can be indicative of the current status. The results of the 2012 WFD baseline surveys are indicative of generally low nutrient concentrations. The status of the seabed and water column/habitats is unknown (no judgements are made on the level of impact, although <5% of the water column and seabed are believed to be impacted, and these areas are close to land with poor mixing, e.g. harbours). Reference is made to WFD reports and to the Barcelona Convention's Strategic Action Plan. ";No conclusion section.;"- Qualitative and quantitative

Malta;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Malta has defined one environmental target and two indicators to address eutrophication (one of which is still not determined). 

It does not refer to any particular eutrophication pressure or impact, and can be read in two distinct ways: if GES for Descriptor 5 is not achieved or is at risk of not being achieved, then further measures should be developed, thereby repeating the overall aim of the MSFD; if available data suggest that the existing eutrophication monitoring programme results lack sensitivity or sufficient spatial resolution, the monitoring should be improved. Although the target it is effectively a restatement of GES, it will allow achieving GES but perhaps not by 2020 since the target refers to long-term data. ";No conclusion section.;"- Target rephrases the GES definition
- Target does not address any specific pressures or impacts
- Target is sufficient to achieve GES but perhaps not by 2020";1;Inadequate
Malta;D5;Consistency ;;"It is not clear whether the assessment of the pressures and their impacts is entirely consistent with Malta’s determination of GES, particularly with regard to indirect effects, since it is not known what the MS intends to monitor and use as indicators for these. While it appears that chlorophyll-a concentration is to be used as an indicator of a direct impact of nutrient enrichment, it is very unclear whether any monitoring of benthic macrovegetation or shifts in floristic composition is to be undertaken, which could mean that only the water column and not the seabed is monitored. Pressures and impacts are discussed in the initial assessment, but an improved method/system of quantifying nutrient loads to the marine environment is required if suspected eutrophication impacts are to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

The single target could cover all impacts, depending on the indicators chosen, and by choosing nutrient concentrations in the marine environment rather than nutrient loading from specified land-based sources, effectively all pressures are included. Thus, any particular pressures or impacts which were identified specifically in the initial assessment could be said to be included in the target.

Monitoring will be required to test the efficacy of existing nutrient management measures and if significant impacts or increases in marine nutrient levels are identified, there will be a need to revisit the measures currently in place. Since the eutrophication target can be read as a restatement of the overall MSFD aim with regard to eutrophication, where GES is not achieved there will be a need to reduce pressures/impacts in affected areas, but not necessarily in all areas.";;;;
Malta;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Malta has defined GES for the biodiversity descriptors at the criteria and indicator level in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, only the general GES statements are provided, the criteria and indicators from the Commission Decision are not provided. Malta has defined GES for Descriptor 1 and Descriptor 6 together, bringing together a mix of the criteria and indicators corresponding to the two descriptors in a single definition. 

Malta has defined GES for Descriptors 1 and 6 through four GES statements:
• The natural range and extent of marine habitats and species are stable, or otherwise in line with the physiographic and climatic conditions, taking into consideration the sustainable use of the marine environment.
• The population abundance of key marine species is stable and their population dynamics are indicative of long-term viability.
• The structure and function of marine habitats ensure their long-term viability
• The long-term viability of key marine habitats is not compromised by anthropogenic pressures and impacts.

Each GES statement is further specified through a number of criteria and indicators that are verbatim copies of those provided in the Commission Decision. Criteria and indicators provided for D1 and D6 in the Commission Decision are combined for certain GES statements (e.g. on the structure and function of marine habitats). 

All the criteria for D1 are included in the definition except criterion 1.7 on the ecosystem structure. A number of indicators are not included (e.g. 1.1.2 or 1.4.2). All the criteria for D6 are included. A number of indicators are not covered (e.g. 6.1.1). 

The overall definition of GES for D1 and D6 remains at a qualitative level. The criteria and indicators included in the definition are a copy of those of the Commission Decision. They are not further specified through parameters, threshold values or trends. The standalone GES does not contain specific parameters or thresholds and is therefore not measurable. Malta does not specify what species or habitats are covered by the definition, which could imply that all relevant species and species groups (mammals, fish, birds, cephalopods and reptiles) and habitats (seabed and water column) are effectively covered. In two GES statements, Malta refers to “key marine species” and “key marine habitats”, without providing further information as to what these are (i.e. Protected species and habitats? Species and habitats of national interest?) 

However, Malta specifies in its accompanying text that the achievement of GES is tied to the achievement of the environmental targets and therefore that the parameters for the achievement of GES (biological components, thresholds, etc.) are defined in the targets. The targets proposed by Malta cover a number of seabed and water column habitats, a number of bird species, one mammal and one reptile species and a number of fish species. Cephalopods are anyway not covered. 

In the first GES statement, Malta uses a baseline in the sense of reference conditions, i.e. in line with the physiographic and climatic conditions, but adds a condition for the sustainable use of the marine environment. In the other GES statements, Malta refers to the rather imprecise notion of “long-term viability”, with no further specification at criteria or indicator levels. In the first two GES statements, Malta requires that there is no further deterioration in the state of the marine environment (“stable”). 

The definition of GES does not contain any reference to other EU legislation (e.g. the Habitats Directive) or to any regional or international agreements. Protected species and habitats as per the Habitats Directive are not directly referred to (although the term “key” could relate to these). 

In its accompanying text, Malta describes in some detail the reasons why it has not included certain criteria and indicators in the GES biodiversity definition. The main reasons include data gaps, and lack of knowledge as well as lack of assessment methodologies. In terms of future plans, Malta specifies that the monitoring programme will address the data gaps in order to apply the criteria and indicators missing in the next implementation cycle.

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

The Maltese assessment of physical loss and physical damage is very limited. Physical loss is attributed mainly to harbour and marina construction as well as dumping at a designated national spoil ground. The area affected by physical loss has not been quantified, the potential impacts of physical loss are described but no assessment has been made of their impact on the environment. 

Reporting on physical damage identifies some causes such as changes in siltation due to discharges and runoff, anchoring, and disposal of inert material and trawling.  An assessment of physical damage has not been done although some potential known impacts are described. In the report regarding trawling impacts a reference is made to a report comparing changes in benthic community structure within fisheries management zones and outside of them. The species studied however include mobile species so the study is not necessarily relevant to physical damage. It is also mentioned that trawling is forbidden in areas characterized by Posidonia Oceanica meadows and other sensitive beds although some trawling zones coincide with bottoms where maerl beds have been documented. No further explanation or references to studies on the effects on maerl beds or other biogenic habitats are provided.

Judgements or trends on physical loss and physical damage are not provided. Malta has explained that there are no judgments due to the fact that for these pressures, level of pressure is not quantified. No justification is provided for not describing trends but this is likely due to the lack of quantified data as well.

Habitats
Malta has produced a separate report for benthic and water column habitats. The benthic habitat reporting ranges from shallow to bathyal habitats. The assessment covers a wide range of habitats but the data provided is mostly of a general data and, where judgements are provided, these are largely qualitative expert judgements. The assessments indicates “good status” for all habitats assessed except for littoral sediment, but the confidence levels of the judgements are low in 66% of cases, 11% moderate and 23% high. The data is often judged as providing an incomplete picture of the situation and status judgements and habitat extents are often based on extrapolated data.

Malta;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Malta has defined 14 proposed targets and three proposed interim targets organized according to the following categories: benthic habitats, water column habitats, seabirds, sea turtles, cetaceans and fish and demersal elasmobranchs. The targets include state, management and knowledge targets. The targets are accompanied by indicators of which 10 are indicated as still having to be developed. Six of the indicators include the word “or” in the texts indicating two different possible approaches for how the indicator might be developed or used. 

The targets for seabirds are the most specific and measurable referring to specific species and setting a threshold requiring the population of several species to remain stable. In regard to habitats, the reference to assessing whether coastal benthic habitats are at “good” status under the WFD potentially allows at least one target for benthic habitats to be measureable. Both for benthic habitats and fish associated with specific habitats, one of the targets requires that the “species composition and/or abundance” remains stable. The concepts of species composition and abundance are however very different and can lead to very different outcomes. The species composition could remain the same even with significantly reduced species abundances. 

The targets in general are not complete, with many aspects still under development and lack ambition as they mostly require the status of the biological components to remain stable or be maintained, except in the case of seabirds for which a number of targets require a reduction in the level of pressure (by-catch, pollution). 

For sea turtles and marine mammals there are currently only knowledge targets, the target for sea turtles has no deadline, the targets referring to benthic habitats are still unspecific referring to areas and habitats to be selected and with indicators only referring to two specific habitats (seagrass meadows and maerl beds), in regard to fish only demersal species are addressed. Combined the targets do not adequately cover the ecosystem as a whole. Lastly in the reporting sheet and for one target in the paper report it is indicated that they should be achieved by 2025 while GES should be achieved by 2020, this implies that these targets are not sufficient to achieve GES by 2020. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Malta;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Malta has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor level in the paper report and in the reporting sheets. The definition is very general and does not cover any of the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision. In addition, elements such as “in so far as practicable” and “to the extent possible” reduce the scope of the definition in relation to the MSFD definition.

These are mainly coastal waters as the only offshore activities in Maltese waters are two aquaculture installations. The main causes of pressure are the discharge of cooling waters from the two power stations at Marsa and Delimara, the discharge of brine from desalination plants and coastal development and dredging. The information on impacts is limited to the increase of temperature of surface water in the area of the Delimara power station and the potential impacts on seabed habitats, namely on Posidonia oceanica meadows. No judgements or trends on the current level of pressure or impacts are provided due to lack of knowledge.

The information on marine acidification is focused on pressures and is based on pH data resulting from the WFD baseline monitoring in 26 stations within WFD coastal water bodies. Industry and shipping are indicated as the major causes of CO2 emissions. No judgements or trends on the current level of pressure or impacts are provided due to lack of knowledge.

Malta;D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Malta has defined one environmental target to address Descriptor 7. The proposed target is measurable, achievable and realistic, but not specific to Descriptor 7 or time-bound. 

On one hand, the target is directly targeted to reducing impacts of human activities, provided they are submitted to regulation and provided that the existing regulatory regime is adapted, but on the other hand it is not specific to Descriptor 7, and it is not demonstrated that the existing regulation correctly address MSFD GES criteria and descriptors. 

The target addresses only new projects and although this is in line with OSPAR guidelines, these are not intended to be used beyond OSPAR areas. In addition, it will not sufficiently address cumulative impacts, or reduce impacts from existing projects/activities (according to the initial assessment, existing activities do cause pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 7). ";No conclusion section.;"- Target only partially measurable
- Target not clearly linked to GES definition
- Target not specific and only relevant to new large scale projects
- Existing projects that continue to exert pressure or have impacts are not addressed";1;Inadequate
Malta;D7;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressure and its impacts is consistent with Malta’s definition of GES for D7 as this definition is very general.

The target addresses only new projects and therefore will not reduce impacts from existing projects/activities; however, according to the initial assessment, existing activities do cause pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 7. It is not demonstrated that Malta waters are at GES (which would be necessary, given that the environmental target addresses only new and large scale projects), and that the existing regulatory regime for all activities can prevent significant degradation related to Descriptor 7 (this is not demonstrated). In these conditions, it is likely that the environmental target will not be sufficient to achieve GES.";;;;
Malta;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Malta has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at the criteria and indicator level in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, Malta has only reported its definition for criterion 8.1 on the concentration of contaminants. 

In the paper report, GES for Descriptor 8 is defined for the two criteria of the Commission Decision, criterion 8.1 on the concentration of contaminants and criterion 8.2 on the effects of contaminants. However, the latter is covered only for indicator 8.2.2 on acute pollution events. Indicator 8.2.1 on the effects of contaminants on ecosystem components is not included in the GES definition.

Malta justifies this gap by referring to the numerous data and knowledge gaps on effects of contaminants on ecosystems or biota. Although research has focused on TBT in marine gastropods it is not deemed mature enough to include as part of the GES definition. 

Concentration of contaminants
In the accompanying text, Malta makes a clear reference to the Water Framework Directive and the achievement of “good chemical status”. It also mentions the necessity to adapt the WFD to the needs of the MSFD, in terms of geographical scope in particular i.e. extending the scope of application of the WFD to the rest of the Maltese territorial waters and also to sea-based sources of pollution. Malta says that this adaptation is done through its environmental targets, linking its GES definition to its environmental targets.

Malta also specifies that the contaminants covered by its GES definition include those of the “Priority Substances Directive”, certainly referring to Annex X of the WFD. It also includes additional contaminants that are normally monitored for the WFD in its scope. In its GES definition, Malta requires these contaminants to be in line with “set environmental quality standards”, in relevant matrices, hence including a reference, even if indirect, to Directive 2008/105/EC (the EQS Directive). Malta adds a condition that contaminants should either be in line with the EQS or otherwise in line with undisturbed conditions. It is not clear in which case each condition applies. 

Effects of contaminants
As mentioned before, Malta has defined GES for effects of contaminants only with regard to acute pollution events (8.2.2). 

The two definitions for acute pollution are qualitative, requiring the prevention of such events originating from shipping-related operations and from hydrocarbon exploration. It requires effective control and assessment of the incidents to avoid pollution effects. Malta extends the origin of the acute pollution event also to land-based activities (without specifying what these could be). Malta does not specify any threshold or trend for the achievement of GES. The criterion and indicator of the Commission Decision are repeated in the paper report but not further specified. The definition does not allow to measure when GES is achieved. ";No conclusion section.;"- GES definition covers the relevant legislation (EQS)
- Refers to matrices of measurement
- Mentions extending the scope of the GES to all territorial waters
- GES covers acute pollution events but only qualitatively";2;Partially adequate
Malta;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Malta made an assessment of the level of contamination by synthetic and non-synthetic substances of its marine environment, mostly in water but also in sediment. Malta’s assessment is detailed when it comes to land-based diffuse and point sources of contamination. It is more limited regarding sea-based and atmospheric sources of contamination. The main land-based sources of contamination include industrial and urban discharges. Other activities include desalination plants, land-based fish farm facilities, energy generation plants but at a much lower rate.  

Malta provides quantified information about input loads for a number of synthetic and non-synthetic substances. In its paper report, Malta provides a number of maps illustrating the various locations of sources of contaminants. It also provides graphs on input loads of certain contaminants. In the reporting sheet, it specifies that the assessment is not complete because Malta does not have data for more than half of the substances of the EQS Directive. 

The synthetic substances assessed include a number of substances covered by the EQS Directive: tetrachloroethylene (the main known contaminant discharged into the marine environment), trichloromethane, tributyltin compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Malta also reports on the concentration levels of a number of additional substances, measured in sediment, that are not in the EQS Directive but which are part of its monitoring for the Water Framework Directive. This includes Malathion, DDT, Diuron, Endosulfan, Endrin, Hexa-chlorobenzene, Hexachloro-butadiene, Hexachloro-cyclohexane, Pentachlorobenzene, brominated diphenyether, C10-13 chloroalkanes, and Di(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP). Many of these substances are said to be below detection limits when measured in sediment, except DEHP and TBT. Malta also provides information about pesticides pertaining to the group of ‘Persistent Organic Pollutants’ (POPs), namely aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex and toxaphene, specifying that their ban in 1998 is reflected in the lack of detection of some of these substances in sewage waters.  

The reporting on heavy metals covers cadmium, lead, mercury and nickel for the substances included in the EQS Directive, with nickel and its compounds being the main substance discharged. A number of substances not listed in the EQS Directive – boron, petroleum hydrocarbons, zinc – are also reported by Malta as they are part of its Water Framework Directive monitoring. Malta provides limited information about the discharge of PAHs from sea-based activities (shipping, offshore extraction). Malta reports very little about air-based sources of contamination. It mostly describes loads of heavy metals from road traffic air pollution, which may end up in the marine environment.

Malta’s reporting on the impacts of contaminants on seabed habitats, functional groups and biota is limited, in the reporting sheets and the paper report. 

With regard to sediment and seabed habitats, Malta reports two synthetic substances (HCB and HCBD) below detection limits in Posidonia oceanica in 2012. It has also measured mercury levels in Posidonia oceanica but is not in a position to assess whether levels were high or low. Actual impacts on seabed habitats are unknown. With regard to functional groups, Malta reports on bioaccumulation of heavy metals in benthic invertebrates (Patella rustica, Lepidochitona corrugata) through the results of unpublished scientific research. The level of confidence in the conclusion that heavy metals have accumulated in benthic invertebrates, and to a lower extent in fish tissues (Mullus surmuletus), is quite low and Malta specifies that it cannot make a trend assessment with the data collected. The impacts of bioaccumulation on functional groups have not been assessed. The only impact assessed relates to the effect of TBT on the gastropod Hexaplex trunculus (the imposex effect). A number of studies have shown a decrease in the intensity of imposex to lower levels than levels recorded in 1996, in particular in MPAs.

In terms of judgement, Malta has made a judgment only on the current level of pressure from contamination by synthetic components. The current level of pressure is judged as acceptable (good), in relation to GES. For the substances covered by the EQS Directive, the threshold value is the EQS. For the substances measured in sediment and not covered by the EQS Directive, the level of pressure is considered acceptable (good) when the percentage of substances which concentration in sediment is detectable is less than ¼ of all synthetic substances assessed. The current level of pressure from heavy metals contamination is not assessed by Malta. The justification for this gap is the difficulties in comparing current and past assessment data. The level of impacts from both synthetic and non-synthetic substances on seabed habitats and functional groups has not been assessed in relation to GES, which Malta justifies by the lack of data.

In the paper report, Malta describes extensively the various legal and policy frameworks that relate to the contamination of the marine environment. In addition to mentioning the relevant EU legislation, Malta describes in details the effort made within the framework of the Barcelona Convention and the LBS Protocol. In particular, it refers several times in the paper report and the reporting sheet to its National Baseline Budget (NBB) for emissions/releases of the SAP targeted pollutants from land-based sources and the National Action Plan (NAP) developed on this basis outlining the limit values and environmental quality standards for the discharge of a number of substances. 

In the paper report, Malta reports on the following data gaps:
-	information on input loads of contaminants as listed in the Priority Substances Directive from all sources of pollution, particularly diffuse land-based sources, sea-based sources of pollution as well as atmospheric deposition.
-	trend data on contaminant concentrations in the different media in Malta; and 
-	effects of contaminants on marine habitats and biota, which data gap can be appropriately addressed through specific research activity.

Radionuclides
Malta has not made an assessment of the contamination of its marine waters by radionuclides. 

Acute pollution events
Malta has reported quite extensively on acute pollution events, including oil spills (categorised by significance, i.e. amount of oil spilled – small, medium and large), pollution events in ports and discharges of bilges. In the paper report, Malta provides a number of maps showing the geographical localisation of these events and provides details of the activities causing these incidents (vessel traffic, bunkering and vessel related port activities, land-based activities, energy production). 

Malta however mentions that it does not have data on the substances discharged and the volume of discharges. It also does not have data to make an assessment of the impacts on ecosystem components of acute pollution events. ";No conclusion section.;"- Input loads are reported on quantitatively as far as possible
- Sources of contamination are described in detail
- The assessment of impacts is very limited
- Judgement of GES is only provided in relation to the level of pressure and not impacts";2;Partially adequate
Malta;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Malta has defined three targets and three accompanying indicators for Descriptor 8. 

The first target relates to the level of concentration of contaminants requiring them to be at ‘acceptable levels’. While this is not further defined, it can be assumed that these refer to the EU standards defined in the EQS, in line with the GES definition. However, this is not explicitly stated in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, Malta has reported as the EQS Directive as “threshold values”.  The target adds a condition that there should be no deterioration trends in concentration levels in relevant matrices. If ‘acceptable levels’ do refer to the EQS, the addition of this condition makes the target more stringent than the GES, which will ensure the achievement of GES. The timeline to achieve the target is 2020, in line with the achievement of GES.

The second target is a research target aiming to gather more knowledge about sea-based sources of pollution. The target refers to the contribution of maritime sectors to the contamination of the marine environment. It is not certain what ‘contribution’ means in this context, whether it is about simply assessing the input loads of contaminants to the sea from various maritime activities or if it also includes impacts of the contamination on the ecosystem. The indicator refers to the ‘level of knowledge’ but does not include any sort of measurable indication of what ‘level of knowledge’ should be achieved. The timeline for the achievement of the target is reported as 2018 in the reporting sheet. This could offer Malta the opportunity to set targets related to reduce pressure from maritime activities to help achieve GES by 2020.

The third target is a data collection and monitoring target related to pollution incidents from shipping-related sources and from hydrocarbon exploration. The target is a starting point to achieve GES for indicator 8.2.2, which requires that pollution incidents are ‘controlled and assessed’ but it does not cover the first part related to prevention. The target is measurable as its achievement depends on the implementation of an information system. The timeline for the achievement of the target is reported as 2018 in the reporting sheets. This could give time to Malta to put in place prevention-focused targets to achieve GES by 2020.

In the accompanying text, Malta reproduces the measures already implemented through Malta’s Water Catchment Management Plan to show the activities already in place to deal with contamination of marine waters. ";No conclusion section.;"- One state based target
- Target has slightly higher ambition than the GES definition
- One research and one monitoring targets
- Current targets may not be sufficient to achieve GES
- New targets based on outcomes of knowledge targets in 2018 might allow the achievement of GES";2;Partially adequate
Malta;D8;Consistency ;;"The initial assessment of Malta in relation to contamination of the marine environment is consistent with its definition of GES as it addresses only the level of pressure and not the level of impacts. One inconsistency is that Malta has made a judgment in relation to GES for a number of substances that do not have EQS defined. For this, Malta has defined its own standard but it not included this standard in its GES definition. 

The targets defined cover only certain aspects of the initial assessment but do not really cover the main gaps, which are the assessment of impacts on ecosystem components. Since Malta has defined two research and monitoring targets, it would have been consistent that it defines a research target on the assessment of impacts. ";;;;
Malta;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Malta has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at the criteria and indicator level in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, Malta has only reported its definition at descriptor level. 

The Maltese definition for D9 is a verbatim copy of the text of Annex I of Directive and of the Commission Decision. The definitions at criterion and indicator levels do not provide any further details that would make the definition more specific.

The definition is measurable since it refers to the levels established by Community legislation. In the reporting sheet, Malta specifies that the baseline used to measure GES will be the data collected in 2010-2012 for Regulation 1881/2006. In the paper report, Malta mentions that its GES definition reflects the requirements of Regulation 1881/2006.

However, there is no further specification from Malta for indicator 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded. As such, without specification of a threshold value or baseline, the indicator cannot be used to measure the achievement of GES. 

No information is provided regarding which substances will be used to measure GES and in which species the measurements will be made. There ";No conclusion section.;"- GES is a verbatim copy of the Annex I definition

Malta;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Malta has provided a limited assessment of contamination of fish and seafood. It mentions that it monitors contaminants in fish and seafood as per the requirements of Regulation 1881/2006 but explains that it relates only to heavy metals and not to synthetic substances. It has therefore not made any conclusions with regard to the assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by synthetic substances. 

With regard to heavy metals, Malta assesses levels of contamination for lead and cadmium in fish and cephalopods below the EU standards. It mentions a few exceptions related to levels of mercury in muscle meat of fresh dogfish, chilled tuna and fresh and frozen swordfish higher than permissible levels. 

In the paper report, Malta provides a list of the species sampled in the monitoring for Regulation 1881/2006 and specifies that these are species caught in Maltese marine waters but that they are sampled at the retail market. 

In terms of judgment, Malta mentions that these exceedances were reported to be infrequent but does not provide more details on what this means. It reports however that the data collected is not sufficient to provide a picture complete enough to make a judgment in relation to GES.

Netherlands;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Netherlands have set GES for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 only at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. The NL definitions simply reproduce the Directive definitions in Annex I, hence there is no thresholds, reference conditions or baseline. The NL links it definition of GES to its setting of targets. The criteria from the Commission Decision are not used to define GES but to set targets. No alternative criteria/indicators are presented.

In the accompanying text to its GES definition, the Netherlands gives a general description of current policy, pressures, and feasibility of achieving GES under current circumstances. In terms of policy, it refers to specification of the Birds and Habitats Directive and policy initiated pursuant to the Conservation Plan for the Harbour Porpoise.

The Netherlands makes a judgement on the current status of the marine ecosystem considered as a whole as not good enough to guarantee its structure and functions and conclude to the need to focus on a revised CFP and to introduce additional seabed protection in the Frisian Front and the Central Oyster Grounds in order to reverse the downward tide in 2020 even if it is expected that GES will not be reached by then and possibly even not in 2027 (paper report, p.81-82).  

The reporting sheet indicates that GES covers all bird, fish and mammal species, but it seems that cephalopods and reptiles are not covered. It is likely that the latter is not applicable in this region.

With regard to D1, no predominant habitats, special or other habitats are specified in the definition of GES and the assumption is made that GES definition applies to all seabed habitats in the assessment table of the reporting sheet, which would suggest that water column habitats are not included. Despite this, no GES for these predominant habitats/special habitats /other habitats groups is given and no reference is given to the definition of GES addressing special/listed habitats and species (of Habitats and Birds Directives and relevant international agreements). The accompanying text in the paper report does refer to the ecosystem structure but with a single sentence describing the current situation. No mention is made about the composition and proportion of predominant habitats and species/functional groups within the ecosystem. In relation to D4, no reference is made to species which could be used as indicators of changes in the food web and, with regard to D6, no reference is made to relevant biogenic structure, nor to any relevant substrate types. 

In general there is a clear lack of specification of what is meant by various general concepts included in the GES definitions (e.g. prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions, normal abundance, diversity and levels, levels that ensure that that the structure and functions of the ecosystems are safeguarded). However, the NL acknowledges that ‘good environmental status cannot be clearly defined at the level of the ecosystem as a coherent whole, because it cannot be compared to a situation in which the system was (relatively) undisturbed ’.

The definition of GES does not reflect the definitions for Favourable Conversation Status under the Habitats Directive and for Good Ecological Status under the Water Framework Directive. GES is determined at the level of the whole Dutch part of the North Sea  which is considered as a suitable ecological-relevant scale.";Overall the definition of GES does not meet the minimum requirements and is assessed as inadequate. The GES definition for D1, D4 and D6 is only set at the descriptor level and merely reproduces the Directive. No information is provided about baselines or reference points to assess progress towards GES. No reference is made in the BHD or WFD definitions or to any OSPAR EcoQOs. ;"- Only set at descriptor level (verbatim copy of descriptor 1,4 and 6 from annex I)

Netherlands;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
The Netherlands has reported on species/functional groups at the level of the species group (birds, fish and marine mammals). The Netherlands justifies not reporting on cephalopods in its response to the completeness assessment by stating that there are no significant populations of cephalopods in the Dutch part of the North Sea apart from incidental influx from the Channel. It has therefore not been considered in any existing assessment, which is the reason why it is not covered in the initial assessment. However, the Netherlands mentions that the species group will be part of future assessment and depending on the status, may be addressed with a target/indicator in the revision of targets and indicators in 2018. Reptiles are not included in the assessment because they are not relevant for the Dutch marine waters. 

In its description of the species group composition, the Netherlands provides information on specific species included in its assessment. The reference to functional groups is only done for fish species (demersal/pelagic/diadromous/elasmobranch) but they are not reported on separately. In its description of the groups’ relative abundance and/or biomass, the Netherlands provides quantitative information only for marine mammals and only for two species (grey seals and harbour porpoise). The information for fish and birds is qualitative and includes some qualitative trends. The Netherlands provides a negative assessment of the state of the groups’ condition and relative abundance in comparison to natural conditions. The main pressures on the species groups have been identified but they are described in less detail than for habitat types. For all three groups, these two parameters are assessed as altered. In the reporting sheet, no qualitative or quantitative judgement on status or on the trend in status of the species groups has been made. In the paper report, however, an assessment is made of the conservation status of certain birds and mammals (reference to BHD and OSPAR EcoQO on oiled birds) and of the status of certain fish stocks in relation to MSY. 

Species which deserve protection under other international conventions and RSC are acknowledged in the overview reporting sheet but they are not specifically listed. The Netherlands states that species listed under the BHD will be reported under those directives in 2013 and mentions that all species listed by OSPAR and relevant to the Dutch part of the North Sea are also listed under the Bird directive and therefore will be reported under that directive in 2013. Finally, the Netherlands mentions that information regarding the species covered by the Common Fisheries Policy will be provided under this policy. 

An ongoing consideration for the next few years is that insights at ecosystem level and at species and habitat level within the MSFD and BHD framework continue to tie in with each other. As announced in the letter dated 14 September 2011, the Natura 2000 target document will be evaluated in 2015, based in part on the assessment of the favourable conservation status. This will be based on the latest insights in the functioning of the ecosystem coming from the international implementation of the MSFD.

Habitats
Although it is stated that an assessment for habitat types has been carried out, only some habitat types have been included, i.e. shallow and shelf seabed, shelf waters. Littoral and intertidal habitats and coastal waters are not included. 

The classification used by the Netherlands in its paper report is based on the EUNIS level 3 classification, adapted to the Dutch part of the North Sea. In the paper report, the Netherlands assesses four predominant habitat types (shallow fine sand, mid-depth mixed sand, deep fine and coarse sand and deep silty seabed) and three special habitats (Frisian Front, Klaver Bank and Dogger Bank). In the reporting sheet, only four predominant habitats are considered for the assessment (all seabed, none water column) and no individual habitats. The lack of information on other predominant habitats is justified by the fact that some have been reported as part of the seabed habitats and/or under physical features (in particular for marine waters: coastal and shelf). In the reporting sheet the Netherlands has reported its Klaver Bank special area of conservation as a surrogate for the MSFD type “Shelf sublittoral coarse sediment” and indicates that it also relates to the MSFD type “Marine water: shelf”. It has also reported its Frisian Front/Oyster Grounds special areas of conservation as surrogate for the MSFD type “Shelf sublittoral mixed sediment” indicating that they also relate to the MSFD type “Marine water: shelf”. The NL specifies that the habitat types “deep, fine and coarse sand” and “mid-depth mixed sand” in the paper report have been combined in the reporting sheet in order to match the predominant habitat type “shelf sublittoral sand” from the CSWP 2011. 

The Netherlands specifies that certain ‘special habitats types’, which have been identified as Natura 2000 areas because of the special ecological importance at European level, will be reported under the Habitats Directive in 2013. These are the Dogger Bank, the Frisian Front, the Noordzeekustzone, the Voordelta, the Vlakte van Raan and the Klaverbank. 

It should also be noted that in its paper report, the Netherlands reports separately on plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton) and on benthic communities. While no information is reported on plankton in the reporting sheet, information regarding benthic communities is integrated into the various assessments of predominant habitat types. 

For those habitat types reported, the Netherlands provides a description of the habitat distribution, extent and condition. The descriptions contain a certain number of quantitative information, in particular regarding the extent of the habitat. It also provides an indication of the state of the habitat in comparison with natural physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions. For all four predominant habitats reported, the habitat distribution and extent are reported to be in line with natural conditions, while the habitat condition is reported to be altered. The main pressures and human activities causing the pressures and the impacts of these pressures on the habitat types have been described in detail for each predominant habitat. No qualitative or quantitative judgement on status or on the trend in status of the habitat types has been made. 

The Netherlands provides a detailed account of the knowledge gaps regarding the ecosystem status of the North Sea. One of these concerns the extension and division of current indicators for benthic communities into habitat types distinguished within the MSFD and the HD. In terms of future plans addressing the gaps in knowledge and reporting, while none is reported in the reporting sheet directly, the Netherlands has provided more information in its response to the completeness assessment. In particular, the Netherlands mentions that the setting of targets and indicators specifically on habitats, and subsequent monitoring of these targets and indicators, will allow the NL to make an improved assessment for the next reporting cycle.  In addition, the Netherlands mentions the work done with OSPAR to develop common indicators and prepare an intermediate assessment by 2017.

Ecosystems
In the reporting sheet, the Netherlands has reported on the North Sea ecosystem. The Netherlands specifies that the entire Dutch part of the North Sea has been identified as a single ecosystem. It provides a limited description of the ecosystem structure and its functioning in relation to the proportion of selected species at the top of the food webs (although it only mentions large fish), with quantitative trends on the populations of large fish. A detailed assessment of the main pressures on the ecosystem has been made, referring to all the relevant pressures (fisheries, major hydrographical interventions, NIS, contaminants and nutrients, litter and noise). A judgement of the current status of ecosystems structure, productivity and functioning (abundance/distribution of key trophic groups/species) has not been made. A negative quantitative judgement has been made for the proportion of species at the top of food webs, referring to the OSPAR EcoQO on the proportion of large fish in the fish community. However, the Netherlands does not make a conclusive judgement in relation to GES.  

The Netherlands mentions that knowledge gaps have been identified in the course of this reporting exercise and refers for instance to the lack of historical data, the consequences of human use in the past, the effects of the primary disturbances, including bottom trawling fisheries, and how these effects and possible cumulative effects can be identified in the different habitats and species. In terms of future plans, the Netherlands refers to the necessity to develop indicators, in particular for this combined “descriptor” (it is assumed that NL refers here to ecosystems), also in conjunction with the development needs of the BHD. The Netherlands ties in the implementation of the MSFD and of the BHD to explain how insights into ecosystem, species and habitat assessments will improve over the next few years. The objective of the 2017 OSPAR Interim Assessment is referred to once again. ";The assessment of biological features for Descriptors 1 and 6 by the NL is considered adequate while for Descriptor 4 it is considered partially adequate. The assessment of features has identified the relevant predominant habitats, species groups and ecosystems for the NL. The reporting of habitat types is done at a sufficient level of detail while the reporting at species group level and at ecosystem level is rather limited. For all feature types, no judgement has been made in the reporting sheet on the status of the features in relation to GES but the NL provides systematically an assessment of the status of the features’ characteristics (e.g. habitat condition) in relation to natural physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions, which is in line with their GES definition. Assessments of status are also provided for certain species in the paper report on the basis of European or regional standards (MSY, FCS). Finally, the NL does provide an aggregated judgement on the current (not good) status of the whole marine ecosystem in its approach to defining GES. In the case of food webs, the NL refers to top predators but only in reference to large fish using the OSPAR EcoQO for large fish, which is not sufficient to cover the food web as a whole. Also no judgement has been made of the status for ecosystem functions such as productivity and structure.  ;"Features:
- Relevant predominant habitats, species groups and ecosystems are identified
- Reporting on habitat types is done at a sufficient level of details while it is rather limited at the ecosystem level
- No judgement on the status of features has been made in relation to GES but a judgement has been made in relation to natural conditions
- The status of certain species is judged on the basis of EU or regional standards (MSY, FCS)
- The Netherlands has judged the ecosystem of the North Sea as a whole as not good";3;Adequate
Netherlands;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The NL has set up targets that cover several descriptors at the same time. Therefore, the adequacy of the targets is considered in combination for D1, D4 and D6. The twelve targets and associated indicators relevant to D1, D4 and D6 cover all criteria for D1, 4 and 6 from the Commission Decision. There are no conflicting targets or associated indicators and all are consistent as a set. 

All targets and indicators that have been established for the marine ecosystem, apply to all habitats, unless otherwise stated. With regard to the coverage of species, the NL opted to report on species-group level rather than on the level of functional group or species. However, some of the targets/indicators are on the level of individual species or functional groups, in particular those relating to other policy or developed in OSPAR context. For example for marine mammals there are specific national targets pursuant to the Habitats Directive for grey seal, common seal and harbour porpoise (target 1g), for birds there are national targets under the Birds Directive (target 1f). The species group ‘cephalopods’ is not covered by targets/indicators as there are no significant populations in the Dutch part of the North Sea and they have not been considered in the initial assessment. The NL has noted that this group will be part of future assessment and depending on the status, may be addressed with a target/indicator in the revision of targets and indicators in 2018.

The targets have a time frame for achievement and are measurable in most cases. The baseline for most of the targets is the current state although it is unclear how this relates to the 2012 initial assessment. Some targets are not specific and relate to a trend (improvement, reversal of trend, remains the same), rather than setting a specific target level. These are generally interim targets. This is also linked to the general lack of knowledge identified by the NL as to exactly determine GES or to establish a link between the disturbances and good environmental status, environmental targets and measures. The NL has pointed out that the interim targets indicate the desired direction in a qualitative manner, while more knowledge is being gathered.

No thresholds or reference points are given, however the justification for this is well explained by the NL. No quantitative thresholds have been provided for those targets, where the associated indicators are still under development (targets 1a, 1b, 1e, 1f, 1g, 1i, 1j, 1k and 1m). For those targets which refer to existing targets under other policies, the thresholds are not repeated but apply. This is the case for target 1l (Water Framework Directive) and targets 1b, 1f, 1g and 1k (Birds and Habitats Directives). 

Most targets are state targets. The pressure targets are general and not specific. The only pressure targets are for fisheries and fisheries discards and two impact targets are given relating to human interactions of foodwebs and on sea floor integrity. Other specific pressures or impacts are not implied in the state targets. One target (1m) however is very general and refers to all ‘human activities’ which could cover all pressures and impacts. It is however an interim target and is not specific.";The set of targets and associated indicators defined by the NL for biodiversity is considered partially adequate. None of the targets are fully SMART, although they are potentially measurable, so it is not possible to determine whether they are achievable or realistic. Most associated indicators are still under development. The targets are not sufficiently ambitious to reduce the pressures or impacts to levels that will achieve GES because they do not directly address all relevant pressures and impacts, the majority of the targets being state targets. However, the NL has offered a detailed justification for the approach chosen which appears to be pragmatic and realistic. It has provided indications of how it will address the gaps, in particular through the continuing development of indicators within OSPAR, in order to be able to address gaps in the next reporting cycle and therefore make the targets more operational. ;"- None of the targets are SMART and it is not possible to determine whether they are achievable or realistic

Netherlands;D1;Consistency ;;"In its assessment of pressures and features related to the biodiversity descriptors, the NL has identified in general the relevant elements to be assessed even if it remains rather limited. In addition, it has systematically assessed the status of these habitats in relation to natural physiographic, geographic and climate conditions. As this is in line with their GES definition, it could seem inconsistent that the NL has decided not to make a judgement on the status of the features in relation to GES. However, the NL has justified this by mentioning that the initial assessment has been done before the GES for D1, 4 and 6 was defined (see comments on this approach in Section 1). 

The collective set of targets defined by the NL is unlikely to lead to a reduction in all the identified pressures/ impacts, given that they are mostly state targets and that pressures and impacts are not all covered (or in a very unspecific way through one general target applying to all human activities). As the current status of all the main biodiversity components (functional groups and predominant habitats or their surrogate species and biotopes) has not been clearly determined, it is not possible to evaluate whether all these components that have been judged as “not good status” in the initial assessment are covered.";;;;
Netherlands;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The NL has defined GES for descriptor 10 at descriptor level only. The criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 10 in the Commission Decision have not been incorporated. The GES definition at descriptor level reflects the definition in the Directive, to which it adds on small plastic particles, including micro-particles and an overall reduction of the volume of marine litter over time. 

Yet, it is unclear how the NL aims to achieve a volume reduction and whether it will address new waste entering the marine environment and/or the existing waste in the marine environment. A baseline and threshold values have not yet been set. Due to the complexity of the marine litter problem, the NL has difficulties in formulating a more precise and quantitative definition and is unclear on whether GES can be achieved by 2020.

In the GES definition, the NL does not specifically refer to OSPAR. It does mention the MARPOL Convention Annex V and the European Directive on port reception facilities. The MARPOL Convention Annex V imposes a complete ban on waste disposal as of 1 January 2013, with some exceptions (food remnants). In addition, keeping a Garbage Record Book is already compulsory for the MARPOL convention. The NL is also committed to optimising the European Directive on port reception facilities by such measures as the mandatory delivery of waste when a ship leaves for a port outside the EU, a European information and monitoring system, and harmonisation of the enforcement and financing systems.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 10 is considered as inadequate. The GES definition provided by the NL has been developed further than the text provided in Annex I but does not contain sufficiently specified thresholds and baselines to determine at what point GES is achieved. While the complexity of marine litter is acknowledged, the reported GES definition remains insufficient specified considering the state of knowledge and indicators already available (OSPAR EcoQO).  The NL has opted instead to use the indicators such as the OSPAR EcoQO for plastic in fulmar stomachs for the Article 10 targets instead of for Article 9 definition of GES which is in line with the Dutch methodology but not in line with the MSFD.;"- The GES definition provided by NL has been developed further than the text provided in Annex I

Netherlands;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Dutch reports substantial information from OSPAR beach litter monitoring activities and the OSPAR EcoQO target on the ingestion of plastic by Fulmars. Beach litter on Dutch beaches is reported as being below the OSPAR target threshold, while the target threshold for plastic ingested by Fulmars is exceeded. Waste collection from the seabed and water column by the “fishing for litter” initiative is also mentioned. Trends in type and amount of waste are reported. Ship traffic and fisheries are reported as the main sources of marine litter. The impact of plastic inflows from rivers is currently being assessed. 

In addition, the NL reports a lack of data and of monitoring protocols for marine litter in the water column, on the seabed, for micro-plastics and for the impact of marine litter on marine life and ecosystems. Aside from the ingestion of plastics by marine life, the entanglement of seabirds, fish and other marine animals is expected to be detrimental. The International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) is expected to be extended in order for it to be able to provide data on seabed litter. Plans to address the knowledge and data gaps are only discussed to a limited extent.";The initial assessment of marine litter in the Dutch marine waters and on the beaches is considered partially adequate considering the knowledge and monitoring data available.

Netherlands;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The NL reports two targets, each associated by one indicator. The targets aim at decreasing trends on beach litter (target 10a) and ingestion of plastic by marine life (target 10b). The two targets are consistent as a set. 

The target and associated indicators are measurable and refer to well-tested OSPAR methodologies and targets agreed by the OSPAR parties. Required data series are available. Yet, the set of targets is limited in terms of ambition and coverage of all aspects of marine litter.  Several frameworks in which targets are formulated are mentioned. With regards to the state of marine litter, litter on the seabed and in the water column, incl. micro-particles are not covered. Floating litter is indirectly addressed through Target 10b. In addition, targets have not been identified to address pressures (sources) of marine litter, despite the statement on the reduction of volume in the GES definition. Quantitative threshold values and baselines have not been set for the beach litter target. The existing OSPAR EcoQO target on the ingestion of plastic by Fulmars implicitly includes a quantitative threshold value. "; In conclusion, the set of targets is partially adequate. Beach litter and the impact of marine litter on marine life have been addressed, but not seabed litter. In addition, in absence of targets addressing pressures, it will be challenging to achieve GES. The EcoQO implicitly refers to a quantitative threshold value. For the target on beach litter, a quantitative threshold is not set. The targets also do not show a high level of ambition. ;"- Targets only provide a general objective to reduce litter on beaches and in marine organisms

The GES definition also addresses micro-plastics and aims for a reduced volume of marine litter. Yet, nor in the IA, nor in the targets, mention is made of micro-plastics and ways to reduce the volume of marine litter. The target on beach litter implicitly assumes beach cleaning as well. Good reference is made to OSPAR initiatives in the IA and targets section, but only to a limited extent in the GES definition.

Netherlands;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The NL has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor level. The criteria laid out for Descriptor 11 in the 2010 Commission Decision are copied into the GES definition at descriptor level. The current state is reported as the baseline.

The GES definition is broadly defined and lacks detail on what GES in practice means. Reference is made to the IMO with respect to continuous low frequency sound.

Netherlands;D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The reported information is limited and largely based on the OSPAR Quality Status Report (QSR) 2010. The NL reports a need to monitor underwater sound. The paper report explains the information gaps, what knowledge exists and how effective the existing policy on the area is. The NL reports that there is substantial information on the potential harmful effects of noise but the actual noise levels underwater, the trends in these levels, and the relationship between the doses of noise received and their effects on populations and at the ecosystem level are unknown. Furthermore it is not yet clear how the impacts of noise relate to other factors impacting the marine environment.

The main pressures of impulsive sound are reported to be construction, seismic surveys, clearing of old ammunition, renewable energy and oil and gas exploration and extraction.  The intensive shipping in the North Sea is the main source of the high ambient noise levels. In general the Dutch chapter on noise in the paper report contains only descriptive knowledge on possible effects but no data on actual impacts or measurements. ";The initial assessment is considered inadequate since the assessment provided is only descriptive and with the exception of pressures which are identified but not quantitatively assessed, very little information specific to Dutch marine waters has been provided.;"- Only qualitative data provided

Netherlands;D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The NL has defined two targets to cover D11, each accompanied by an associated indicator. Target 11a aims to prevent the harmful effects of impulsive noise on the ecosystem for individual cases. Pile-driving and seismic surveys are specifically included in the target. Target 11b addresses continuous noise, but will only be developed by 2018 when more knowledge comes available.

It is unclear why target 11a on the one hand focuses on individual cases in the target definition, but on the other hand refers to a distribution over space and time in the associated indicator. The approach in the target is in line with an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of individual projects (sources of impulsive noise) whereas the indicator in the Decision refers to a large-scale assessment of underwater noise.

The GES definition is consistent with the set of targets, and in correspondence with the Commission Decision, but lack specificity. The targets and the GES definition do not address the pressures of underwater noise. The main pressures are reported in the IA but are described in limited detail. It is doubtful whether GES can be achieved. Substantial data and knowledge gaps are reported.;;;;
Netherlands;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Netherlands (NL) has set GES for Descriptor 2 only at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. The Dutch GES definitions simply reproduce the Directive definitions in Annex I, with one addition ‘exotic species’ which is used as a synonym of non-indigenous species. The addition of the term “exotic species” does not alter the meaning of the GES. The GES definition does not meet the minimum requirements (no further increase of NIS which has an adverse effect on the ecosystem, i.e. no new introductions of NIS, and where possible no further spread of NIS). It does not provide any information on specific vectors or NIS.

There is no threshold, reference condition or baseline. The NL links the definition of GES to the setting of targets. The criteria from the Commission Decision are not used to define GES but to set targets. No alternative criteria/indicators are presented.

In the text accompanying its GES definition, the NL gives a general description of current policies, pressures, and the feasibility of achieving GES under current circumstances. In terms of policy, it refers to a policy document on invasive NIS, the IMO Ballast Water Convention, the establishment of conditions for the Nature Conservation Act permits for the transfer of living shellfish to Natura 2000 areas and the development of a Policy line on shellfish transfers. Finally, it also mentions that the IMO guidelines to prevent the import of NIS by commercial and recreational vessels are through voluntary measures.

The NL note that, considering that the effects of NIS on the ecosystem that have occurred in the past will remain achieving GES is equivalent to the aim of not allowing the ecosystem to change any further. This results in an overall objective to minimise the risk of new introductions (paper report, p.86).  ";The Dutch GES definition for Descriptor 2 is assessed as inadequate. The GES is defined only at the descriptor level, not at the criteria level. The GES definition merely reproduces the Directive Annex I.

Netherlands;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);The Netherlands lists 47 NIS present in the Dutch part of the North Sea, out of which 16 are known to be harmful to the ecosystem. Particular note is made of the Atlantic jackknife clam (Ensis directus) and the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), which are identified as the two main invasive NIS in the area. The Dutch list of NIS counts more species than the DAISIE (Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories for Europe) list. While there are no formal lists drawn by OSPAR, ICES produced a list which identifies 30 NIS that have had adverse impacts on ecosystems or human health within the OSPAR area. The Dutch list is also longer compared to the ICES list.;"The initial assessment carried out by the NL on the introduction of non-indigenous species is considered to be partially adequate. The relevant NIS are covered in the report; the impacts on functional groups are described, but in a very general way. The NL could give some more detail here on e.g. which indigenous functional groups are exactly at risk by the introductions. Pathways are mentioned for each introduced species, and there is enough focus in the text on pathways. The relevant geographical areas are covered. However, the NL has not made a judgement on the level of and impact from this pressure. The lack of judgement is justified by insufficient monitoring data and lack of established assessment methods but does not propose plans to address this gap.";"- Relevant NIS are covered

Netherlands;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The NL has specified one target (and three associated indicators) for Descriptor 2 which is to minimise the risk of new introductions of NIS. The baseline is the current state. In principle it would be adequate to prevent the introduction of NIS in order to achieve GES, but the question is how to measure that there are no new introductions. This requires a complex early warning system and a plan on measures to be taken if introductions are identified. This should be addressed by the target, together with indicators which can be used to determine whether there are new introductions or not. The Indicator 3 targets specific species groups with some examples given (phytoplankton, macrobenthos, fish).

In general, the target and associated indicators are not specific enough as it does not cover identified sources of introduction. The target is time-bound (June 2020), but appears very difficult to measure without further specification, in particular it is not clear to what extent the risk should be minimised. . It is realistic. The NL indicates in the reporting sheet that all indicators need further development and are expected to be operational only by 2018. 

The target and associated indicators are not sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact, or controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved, as it is not explicit enough. In particular, it does not cover all the main sources of new introductions e.g. aquaculture.

The target is not ambitious enough in light of the minimum requirements which entail ‘no new introduction’. Further spreading of NIS is not covered.";The target and associated indicators are assessed as inadequate as they do not cover all the main sources of introduction.

Netherlands;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The NL has set GES for Descriptor 3 at the descriptor level reproducing verbatim the definition as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. The criteria and indicators as provided in the 2010 Commission Decision have not been applied for setting GES by the Netherlands. 

In the paper report, the NL groups its definition of D3 with the definitions of D1, 4 and 6 on biodiversity. In the accompanying to the definitions of GES, the NL refers to existing policies. In the case of D3, it refers to the Common Fisheries Policy and lists the main principles underlying the CFP such as fishing at MSY levels. The NL estimates that it is likely that the CFP reform will not result in achieving GES by 2020 and possibly not even by 2027. ";The GES definition of the NL for Descriptor 3 is assessed as inadequate.

Netherlands;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Dutch assessment on the level of fisheries pressure has been reported on in detail. The Dutch assessment reports on the level of pressure from fisheries by providing the number of vessels, fleet tonnage and fleet engine power for the different fleets. For fleets targeting fish the number of days at sea is also provided but this data is not available for the fleet targeting shellfish. Recreational fisheries are also described and it is indicated that a study on the impacts of sport fishing on species covered by a recovery plan such as cod is underway.

The assessment of impacts on fish stocks provides a general qualitative overview of the various impacts by fisheries as well as quantitative data. For fish stocks with quantitative stock assessments with reference points, 56-60% are indicated as being exploited at or below Fpa or Fmsy with the trend for the number of stocks being harvested at an acceptable level improving. For those species where a quantitative spawning stock assessment was available, it was found that 76-77% of those stocks are at or above SSBpa or SSBmsy-trigger with the number of stocks being within acceptable limits improving. The Netherlands has not concluded on the state of stocks in respect to the GES definition but do conclude that the SSBs for commercial fish stocks are not sufficient to achieve the targets.

The assessment of impacts from fisheries on other ecosystem components has been described both qualitatively as well as quantitatively. 50-75% of seabed habitats and 71% (10/14) of functional groups are indicated as being impacted by fisheries. The status of impacts from fisheries on the seabed is not assessed due to a lack of methods. In case of functional groups it is indicated that the OSPAR EcoQO is not met for the large fish indicator but the status of other functional groups are not mentioned and the status has not been assessed in respect to GES. It is concluded however that the target for large fish in the fish community has not been met. ";The analysis and assessment by the NL on the level of, and impact from, fisheries is considered as adequate in light of the available knowledge/ level of information/ established methods. The data is comprehensive and links the initial assessment to the targets although not to the GES definition. Additionally the inclusion of data on recreational fisheries is a specific strongpoint of the Dutch assessment. ;"- Comprehensive assessments of fleets

Netherlands;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The NL has defined 6 targets and 5 associated indicators that address fisheries and 2 targets that specifically target commercial fish stocks. Targets 1c1, is measurable and in line with the objectives of the Commission to exploit all stocks at or below Fmsy. Target 1d is in line with the objectives of the Commission for stocks to be within safe biological limits but it should be explicitly stated that SSB should be at or above SSBpa for all commercially exploited fish and shellfish. Both indicator 3.1 and 3.2 are mentioned to be existing ICES indicators while for SSB there is also an aggregated OSPAR indicator which indicates the number of commercially exploited fish stocks that are at SSBpa. In the report it is mentioned that sufficient knowledge to calculate MSY levels is only available for a “handful” of species. 

In regard to target 1e, it is not clear whether the minimization or elimination of discards needs to occur by 2020. In the former situation the target is not sufficiently clear on what minimisation implies and therefore not SMART. 

Targets 1b, 1c2 and 1h apply to the biodiversity objectives of the NL but also to Descriptor 3. For the indicator “Size distribution of fish stocks, of both commercially exploited and vulnerable species. For each species, the 95% percentile of the fish length distribution observed in surveys by research ships” it is mentioned that there is an OSPAR indicator which will need to be revised to fit within the ICES context.  For the indicator “Aggregated indicators for population size, distribution and condition of sharks, skates and rays, fish species with a long-term negative trend and migratory fish (Commission Decision, criteria 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 4.3)” it is stated that this indicator will need to be developed for commercially exploited fish species in the ICES framework and for non-commercially exploited fish in OSPAR.

The initial assessment is thorough and specifically states that the current environment does not meet the conditions set out by the targets.

The current Dutch GES definition which is a verbatim reproduction of Annex I is not sufficient to determine what actually constitutes the achievement of GES. ";;;;
Netherlands;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"From Descriptor 1 , 4, 6 assessment (Inadequate; 1):

The Netherlands (the NL) have set GES for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 only at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. The NL definitions simply reproduce the Directive definitions in Annex I, hence there is no thresholds, reference conditions or baseline. The NL links it definition of GES to its setting of targets. The criteria from the Commission Decision are not used to define GES but to set targets. No alternative criteria/indicators are presented.

In the accompanying text to its GES definition, the NL gives a general description of current policy, pressures, and feasibility of achieving GES under current circumstances. In terms of policy, it refers to specification of the Birds and Habitats Directive and policy initiated pursuant to the Conservation Plan for the Harbour Porpoise.

The NL makes a judgement on the current status of the marine ecosystem considered as a whole as not good enough to guarantee its structure and functions and conclude to the need to focus on a revised CFP and to introduce additional seabed protection in the Frisian Front and the Central Oyster Grounds in order to reverse the downward tide in 2020 even if it is expected that GES will not be reached by then and possibly even not in 2027 (paper report, p.81-82).  

The reporting sheet indicates that GES covers all bird, fish and mammal species, but it seems that cephalopods and reptiles are not covered. It is likely that the latter is not applicable in this region.

With regard to D1, no predominant habitats, special or other habitats are specified in the definition of GES and the assumption is made that GES definition applies to all seabed habitats in the assessment table of the reporting sheet, which would suggest that water column habitats are not included. Despite this, no GES for these predominant habitats/special habitats /other habitats groups is given and no reference is given to the definition of GES addressing special/listed habitats and species (of Habitats and Birds Directives and relevant international agreements). The accompanying text in the paper report does refer to the ecosystem structure but with a single sentence describing the current situation. No mention is made about the composition and proportion of predominant habitats and species/functional groups within the ecosystem. In relation to D4, no reference is made to species which could be used as indicators of changes in the food web and, with regard to D6, no reference is made to relevant biogenic structure, nor to any relevant substrate types. 

In general there is a clear lack of specification of what is meant by various general concepts included in the GES definitions (e.g. prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions, normal abundance, diversity and levels, levels that ensure that that the structure and functions of the ecosystems are safeguarded). However, the NL acknowledges that ‘good environmental status cannot be clearly defined at the level of the ecosystem as a coherent whole, because it cannot be compared to a situation in which the system was (relatively) undisturbed ’.

The definition of GES does not reflect the definitions for Favourable Conversation Status under the Habitats Directive and for Good Ecological Status under the Water Framework Directive. GES is determined at the level of the whole Dutch part of the North Sea  which is considered as a suitable ecological-relevant scale.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Overall the definition of GES does not meet the minimum requirements and is assessed as inadequate.

Netherlands;D4;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Ecosystems
In the reporting sheet, the NL has reported on the North Sea ecosystem. The NL specifies that the entire Dutch part of the North Sea has been identified as a single ecosystem. It provides a limited description of the ecosystem structure and its functioning in relation to the proportion of selected species at the top of the food webs (although it only mentions large fish), with quantitative trends on the populations of large fish. A detailed assessment of the main pressures on the ecosystem has been made, referring to all the relevant pressures (fisheries, major hydrographical interventions, NIS, contaminants and nutrients, litter and noise). A judgement of the current status of ecosystems structure, productivity and functioning (abundance/distribution of key trophic groups/species) has not been made. A negative quantitative judgement has been made for the proportion of species at the top of food webs, referring to the OSPAR EcoQO on the proportion of large fish in the fish community. However, the NL does not make a conclusive judgement in relation to GES.  

The NL mentions that knowledge gaps have been identified in the course of this reporting exercise and refers for instance to the lack of historical data, the consequences of human use in the past, the effects of the primary disturbances, including bottom trawling fisheries, and how these effects and possible cumulative effects can be identified in the different habitats and species. In terms of future plans, the NL refers to the necessity to develop indicators, in particular for this combined “descriptor” (it is assumed that NL refers here to ecosystems), also in conjunction with the development needs of the BHD. The NL ties in the implementation of the MSFD and of the BHD to explain how insights into ecosystem, species and habitat assessments will improve over the next few years. The objective of the 2017 OSPAR Interim Assessment is referred to once again. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Features:
The assessment of biological features for Descriptors 1 and 6 by the NL is considered adequate while for Descriptor 4 it is considered partially adequate. The assessment of features has identified the relevant predominant habitats, species groups and ecosystems for the NL. The reporting of habitat types is done at a sufficient level of detail while the reporting at species group level and at ecosystem level is rather limited. For all feature types, no judgement has been made in the reporting sheet on the status of the features in relation to GES but the NL provides systematically an assessment of the status of the features’ characteristics (e.g. habitat condition) in relation to natural physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions, which is in line with their GES definition. Assessments of status are also provided for certain species in the paper report on the basis of European or regional standards (MSY, FCS). Finally, the NL does provide an aggregated judgement on the current (not good) status of the whole marine ecosystem in its approach to defining GES. In the case of food webs, the NL refers to top predators but only in reference to large fish using the OSPAR EcoQO for large fish, which is not sufficient to cover the food web as a whole. Also no judgement has been made of the status for ecosystem functions such as productivity and structure.  ";"Features:

Netherlands;D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Partially adequare; 2):

The NL has set up targets that cover several descriptors at the same time. Therefore, the adequacy of the targets is considered in combination for D1, D4 and D6. The twelve targets and associated indicators relevant to D1, D4 and D6 cover all criteria for D1, 4 and 6 from the Commission Decision. There are no conflicting targets or associated indicators and all are consistent as a set. 

All targets and indicators that have been established for the marine ecosystem, apply to all habitats, unless otherwise stated. With regard to the coverage of species, the NL opted to report on species-group level rather than on the level of functional group or species. However, some of the targets/indicators are on the level of individual species or functional groups, in particular those relating to other policy or developed in OSPAR context. For example for marine mammals there are specific national targets pursuant to the Habitats Directive for grey seal, common seal and harbour porpoise (target 1g), for birds there are national targets under the Birds Directive (target 1f). The species group ‘cephalopods’ is not covered by targets/indicators as there are no significant populations in the Dutch part of the North Sea and they have not been considered in the initial assessment. The NL has noted that this group will be part of future assessment and depending on the status, may be addressed with a target/indicator in the revision of targets and indicators in 2018.

The targets have a time frame for achievement and are measurable in most cases. The baseline for most of the targets is the current state although it is unclear how this relates to the 2012 initial assessment. Some targets are not specific and relate to a trend (improvement, reversal of trend, remains the same), rather than setting a specific target level. These are generally interim targets. This is also linked to the general lack of knowledge identified by the NL as to exactly determine GES or to establish a link between the disturbances and good environmental status, environmental targets and measures. The NL has pointed out that the interim targets indicate the desired direction in a qualitative manner, while more knowledge is being gathered.

No thresholds or reference points are given, however the justification for this is well explained by the NL. No quantitative thresholds have been provided for those targets, where the associated indicators are still under development (targets 1a, 1b, 1e, 1f, 1g, 1i, 1j, 1k and 1m). For those targets which refer to existing targets under other policies, the thresholds are not repeated but apply. This is the case for target 1l (Water Framework Directive) and targets 1b, 1f, 1g and 1k (Birds and Habitats Directives). 

Most targets are state targets. The pressure targets are general and not specific. The only pressure targets are for fisheries and fisheries discards and two impact targets are given relating to human interactions of foodwebs and on sea floor integrity. Other specific pressures or impacts are not implied in the state targets. One target (1m) however is very general and refers to all ‘human activities’ which could cover all pressures and impacts. It is however an interim target and is not specific.

";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of targets and associated indicators defined by the NL for biodiversity is considered partially adequate. None of the targets are fully SMART, although they are potentially measurable, so it is not possible to determine whether they are achievable or realistic. Most associated indicators are still under development. The targets are not sufficiently ambitious to reduce the pressures or impacts to levels that will achieve GES because they do not directly address all relevant pressures and impacts, the majority of the targets being state targets. However, the NL has offered a detailed justification for the approach chosen which appears to be pragmatic and realistic. It has provided indications of how it will address the gaps, in particular through the continuing development of indicators within OSPAR, in order to be able to address gaps in the next reporting cycle and therefore make the targets more operational.

Netherlands;D4;Consistency ;;"In its assessment of pressures and features related to the biodiversity descriptors, the NL has identified in general the relevant elements to be assessed even if it remains rather limited. In addition, it has systematically assessed the status of these habitats in relation to natural physiographic, geographic and climate conditions. As this is in line with their GES definition, it could seem inconsistent that the NL has decided not to make a judgement on the status of the features in relation to GES. However, the NL has justified this by mentioning that the initial assessment has been done before the GES for D1, 4 and 6 was defined (see comments on this approach in Section 1). 

The collective set of targets defined by the NL is unlikely to lead to a reduction in all the identified pressures/ impacts, given that they are mostly state targets and that pressures and impacts are not all covered (or in a very unspecific way through one general target applying to all human activities). As the current status of all the main biodiversity components (functional groups and predominant habitats or their surrogate species and biotopes) has not been clearly determined, it is not possible to evaluate whether all these components that have been judged as “not good status” in the initial assessment are covered.";;;;
Netherlands;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The NL has defined GES for Descriptor 5 only at descriptor level in both the reporting sheet and the paper report. The Dutch definition simply reproduces the Directive definition in Annex I of the MSFD. None of the criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 5 in the Commission Decision is incorporated in the GES definition and no justification is provided for doing so. Gaps in knowledge have not been identified, but a short text on current/initiated policy and on the attainability of GES is provided. 

Even though relevant features impacted and pressures addressed are listed in the reporting sheet, they are not referred to in the definition itself or in the accompanying text in the paper report, making the list less useful. There is no reference to cumulative impacts. There is no direct mention of threshold values and baseline values for GES in the reporting sheet or paper report. Nonetheless, the environmental targets do refer to thresholds and baselines for some criteria, which means that some descriptor-level definitions must have been developed.

The paper report refers to implementation of the WFD River Basin Management Plans, but it does not explain how the WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications are to be integrated into MSFD classifications of good environmental status. The achievement of the MSFD GES beyond 2020 is considered within reach, provided that the measures agreed (internationally) under the WFD for nutrients are implemented. In addition, implementation of the Nitrates Directive, Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, the Directive on National Emission Ceilings for certain pollutants, the MARPOL Convention and the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution are all mentioned (but not in detail). No reference is made to the OSPAR eutrophication strategy under Article 9, but a failure to meet relevant OSPAR thresholds is reported in the Initial Assessment. 

The NL concludes that the fact that there are only a few eutrophication phenomena in the Dutch part of the North Sea shows that the existing policies are adequate (“on the right path”).";The GES definition of the NL for D5 is assessed as inadequate. The GES definition is just a copy of the MSFD Annex I, and does not meet its minimum requirements, since it is not presented at criteria/indicator level and no quantitative baselines or thresholds are established. It is also not clearly explained how the definition of GES is integrated with WFD thresholds. Although it is inferred that achievement of GES is related to the achievement of existing policies, the lack of specification in the definition and the accompanying text makes it impossible to determine with certainty when GES is achieved.;"- Only set at descriptor level (verbatim copy of Descriptor 5 from Annex I)
- No baselines or reference points
- No clear explanation of the integration of the WFD normative definitions of ecological status and the MSFD GES";1;Inadequate
Netherlands;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The level of pressure of eutrophication and its impact on water column and seabed habitats are described. The proportion of the environment and habitats affected, as well as some trends, are provided. It is indicated that since 1990, nutrient load to the North Sea has fallen by 50% with regard to phosphorus and 20-40% with regard to nitrogen, resulting in decreases (albeit less dramatic) in marine nutrient concentrations. However, no nutrient budget appears to have been provided. Organic matter inputs and concentrations show no trends. 

In the paper report eutrophication is referred to as being limited to coastal waters which is mainly due to the diffuse load from agriculture within the river basins discharging into the North Sea. Shipping is also mentioned in the paper report, while the reporting sheets list agriculture, forestry, urban discharges and industry instead. 

No mention is made of the modelling of organic matter enrichment at the oyster beds area, to assess whether the low dissolved oxygen levels which occur there on a seasonal basis are due overwhelmingly to phytoplankton bloom collapses or whether a significant proportion of this is due to organic matter enrichment from land based sources. The situation is exacerbated by thermal stratification. It is also explained that water transparency is low, but the reason for this is primarily due to non-biogenic suspended particulate matter, rather than phytoplankton.

Because GES is inadequately defined, it is has not been possible to make an initial assessment of trophic status (i.e. compliant/non-compliant) according to the MSFD Descriptor 5. Instead, the assessment refers directly to OSPAR and the WFD status, taking into account nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations (which are still considerably above OSPAR thresholds). Only 5-25% of the relevant geographical area is considered to be affected. The oxygen status of bottom waters is not problematic, albeit that WFD coastal water status is classified as moderate. In terms of impact, the status is considered stable, despite the reported reductions in pressures. ";The initial assessment of the NL for eutrophication is assessed as partially adequate. The initial assessment is mostly descriptive, referring to pressures and some trends, however, very little quantitative information is presented. Status is assessed but not in relation to GES definition.;"- IA predominantly descriptive

";2;Partially adequate
Netherlands;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The NL has defined four targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 5, which are the same in the reporting sheet and the paper report. 

All of the targets are specific and measureable, but it is not known whether they are achievable and realistic by 2020, even though it appears that the NL is confident about that (e.g. bearing in mind the information presented in the Initial Assessment, Target 5b will be difficult to achieve). For target 5a a timescale clearly exists, but is only referred to, not reported. Targets 5b and 5c have no time-scale attached, apart from a generic MSFD timescale of achieving GES by 2020. It should be noted that a baseline is set for Target 5c in the reporting sheet (current state) but not in the paper report. Without a baseline, such a target would not be fully operational. 

The targets are all sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of impact. In fact, the targets are all impact-specific, rather than pressure-specific and are little more than criteria-based definitions of the GES for Descriptor 5, so failure to comply with the targets would mean an automatic failure to achieve GES and vice versa. Likewise, achievement of the targets would result in achievement of GES and vice versa. It is considered that the targets are sufficiently ambitious to reduce impact to levels that will achieve GES but achievement of the chlorophyll threshold is considered likely to be very challenging by 2020, even if pressures are reduced substantially further than they already have been in recent decades. Since all targets tackle impact there are no conflicts between them – overall the set of targets is consistent and coherent.

It should be noted that impacts on macrophytobenthos communities and on water transparency are not included in the set of targets/indicators. The WFD requires the development of phytobenthos thresholds for coastal waters, but there are no targets incorporated to adapt or achieve these for MSFD eutrophication purposes, even if no targets or thresholds are established for macrophytobenthos-related impacts in offshore waters.

In the accompanying text, the NL mentions that for the monitoring of progress, priority will be given to OSPAR COMP assessment approach over the WFD approach. Only in coastal areas up to 1 nautical mile will both approaches be applied and harmonized, following OSPAR’s guidance. The NL mentions that the OSPAR COMP assessment uses two additional indicators to those set by the NL to cover D5: area-specific plankton species and changes in benthos/fish mortality. Since these indicators are monitored in the Dutch marine waters through the OSPAR COMP procedure, it is not clear why they were not included in the set of targets and indicators defined by the NL. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by the NL for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. Although they are sufficiently ambitious and targeted to reduced levels of impact in order to achieve GES it is considered that it will be very challenging to achieve the chlorophyll threshold of target 5b by 2020. In addition, although the set of targets is consistent it lacks targets addressing impacts on macrophytobenthos communities and on water transparency. Finally, it is considered that the targets and associated indicators are little more than criteria-based definitions of GES for Descriptor 5 that would have been better reported under Article 9.;"- Targets are sufficiently ambitious to achieve GES

Netherlands;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Inadequate; 1):

The Netherlands (the NL) have set GES for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 only at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. The NL definitions simply reproduce the Directive definitions in Annex I, hence there is no thresholds, reference conditions or baseline. The NL links it definition of GES to its setting of targets. The criteria from the Commission Decision are not used to define GES but to set targets. No alternative criteria/indicators are presented.

In the accompanying text to its GES definition, the NL gives a general description of current policy, pressures, and feasibility of achieving GES under current circumstances. In terms of policy, it refers to specification of the Birds and Habitats Directive and policy initiated pursuant to the Conservation Plan for the Harbour Porpoise.

The NL makes a judgement on the current status of the marine ecosystem considered as a whole as not good enough to guarantee its structure and functions and conclude to the need to focus on a revised CFP and to introduce additional seabed protection in the Frisian Front and the Central Oyster Grounds in order to reverse the downward tide in 2020 even if it is expected that GES will not be reached by then and possibly even not in 2027 (paper report, p.81-82).  

The reporting sheet indicates that GES covers all bird, fish and mammal species, but it seems that cephalopods and reptiles are not covered. It is likely that the latter is not applicable in this region.

With regard to D1, no predominant habitats, special or other habitats are specified in the definition of GES and the assumption is made that GES definition applies to all seabed habitats in the assessment table of the reporting sheet, which would suggest that water column habitats are not included. Despite this, no GES for these predominant habitats/special habitats /other habitats groups is given and no reference is given to the definition of GES addressing special/listed habitats and species (of Habitats and Birds Directives and relevant international agreements). The accompanying text in the paper report does refer to the ecosystem structure but with a single sentence describing the current situation. No mention is made about the composition and proportion of predominant habitats and species/functional groups within the ecosystem. In relation to D4, no reference is made to species which could be used as indicators of changes in the food web and, with regard to D6, no reference is made to relevant biogenic structure, nor to any relevant substrate types. 

In general there is a clear lack of specification of what is meant by various general concepts included in the GES definitions (e.g. prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions, normal abundance, diversity and levels, levels that ensure that that the structure and functions of the ecosystems are safeguarded). However, the NL acknowledges that ‘good environmental status cannot be clearly defined at the level of the ecosystem as a coherent whole, because it cannot be compared to a situation in which the system was (relatively) undisturbed ’.

The definition of GES does not reflect the definitions for Favourable Conversation Status under the Habitats Directive and for Good Ecological Status under the Water Framework Directive. GES is determined at the level of the whole Dutch part of the North Sea  which is considered as a suitable ecological-relevant scale.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2)

The main type and causes of physical loss have been identified and the impact and level of the pressure appears to be well known and documented through the PlanMer (Strategic Environmental Assessment Statement) and appropriate assessment of the National Water Plan. These are the construction of Maasvlakte 2 and the 'Sand Motor' (also known as the Sand Engine) off the coast of Zuid-Holland. Physical loss is noted a pressure on shallow sand habitats but other features are not considered or discussed. It is unclear as to whether this is the only habitat which is affected by this pressure. Some limited indication of the geographical area where this pressure occurs is given.

Information on the level and impact of the pressure is given and appears adequate in the light of the available information. 

The main type and causes of physical damage have been identified but only in terms of the amount of sand extraction and supply and from bottom trawling fisheries.  But no real assessment is given as to the impacts of physical damage. The NL have indicated that they intend to gather knowledge about the effects of the primary disturbances, including bottom trawling, and about how these effects and possible cumulative effects can be identified in the different habitats and species. Other causes (land reclamation and coastal defence construction) are mentioned although the level of pressures and impact from these are not considered. Physical damage is noted a pressure on five habitats but other features are not considered or discussed. The indication of the geographical area where this pressure occurs is provided.

Information on the level of the pressure is given and appears adequate in the light of the available information. However no judgement is made as to the level and impact of the pressure. The NL only refers to other policies documents (Water Framework Directive, Habitats and Birds Directives, EIAs) which do not offer a judgement on the level of the pressure either. 

Biological features (Adequate, 3):

Habitats
Although it is stated that an assessment for habitat types has been carried out, only some habitat types have been included, i.e. shallow and shelf seabed, shelf waters. Littoral and intertidal habitats and coastal waters are not included. 

The classification used by the NL in its paper report is based on the EUNIS level 3 classification, adapted to the Dutch part of the North Sea. In the paper report, the NL assesses four predominant habitat types (shallow fine sand, mid-depth mixed sand, deep fine and coarse sand and deep silty seabed) and three special habitats (Frisian Front, Klaver Bank and Dogger Bank). In the reporting sheet, only four predominant habitats are considered for the assessment (all seabed, none water column) and no individual habitats. The lack of information on other predominant habitats is justified by the fact that some have been reported as part of the seabed habitats and/or under physical features (in particular for marine waters: coastal and shelf). In the reporting sheet the NL has reported its Klaver Bank special area of conservation as a surrogate for the MSFD type “Shelf sublittoral coarse sediment” and indicates that it also relates to the MSFD type “Marine water: shelf”. It has also reported its Frisian Front/Oyster Grounds special areas of conservation as surrogate for the MSFD type “Shelf sublittoral mixed sediment” indicating that they also relate to the MSFD type “Marine water: shelf”. The NL specifies that the habitat types “deep, fine and coarse sand” and “mid-depth mixed sand” in the paper report have been combined in the reporting sheet in order to match the predominant habitat type “shelf sublittoral sand” from the CSWP 2011. 

The NL specifies that certain ‘special habitats types’, which have been identified as Natura 2000 areas because of the special ecological importance at European level, will be reported under the Habitats Directive in 2013. These are the Dogger Bank, the Frisian Front, the Noordzeekustzone, the Voordelta, the Vlakte van Raan and the Klaverbank. 

It should also be noted that in its paper report, the NL reports separately on plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton) and on benthic communities. While no information is reported on plankton in the reporting sheet, information regarding benthic communities is integrated into the various assessments of predominant habitat types. 

For those habitat types reported, the NL provides a description of the habitat distribution, extent and condition. The descriptions contain a certain number of quantitative information, in particular regarding the extent of the habitat. It also provides an indication of the state of the habitat in comparison with natural physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions. For all four predominant habitats reported, the habitat distribution and extent are reported to be in line with natural conditions, while the habitat condition is reported to be altered. The main pressures and human activities causing the pressures and the impacts of these pressures on the habitat types have been described in detail for each predominant habitat. No qualitative or quantitative judgement on status or on the trend in status of the habitat types has been made. 

The NL provides a detailed account of the knowledge gaps regarding the ecosystem status of the North Sea. One of these concerns the extension and division of current indicators for benthic communities into habitat types distinguished within the MSFD and the HD. In terms of future plans addressing the gaps in knowledge and reporting, while none is reported in the reporting sheet directly, the NL has provided more information in its response to the completeness assessment. In particular, the NL mentions that the setting of targets and indicators specifically on habitats, and subsequent monitoring of these targets and indicators, will allow the NL to make an improved assessment for the next reporting cycle.  In addition, the NL mentions the work done with OSPAR to develop common indicators and prepare an intermediate assessment by 2017.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures:
The assessment of physical loss and physical damage by the NL is considered partially adequate. On pressures and impacts, other features than shallow sand habitats are not considered with regard to physical loss and there is no judgement as to the pressure and impact of physical damage. The indication of the geographical area where the pressures occur is provided as is the proportion of the features impacted.

Features:
The assessment of biological features for Descriptors 1 and 6 by the NL is considered adequate while for Descriptor 4 it is considered partially adequate. The assessment of features has identified the relevant predominant habitats, species groups and ecosystems for the NL. The reporting of habitat types is done at a sufficient level of detail while the reporting at species group level and at ecosystem level is rather limited. For all feature types, no judgement has been made in the reporting sheet on the status of the features in relation to GES but the NL provides systematically an assessment of the status of the features’ characteristics (e.g. habitat condition) in relation to natural physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions, which is in line with their GES definition. Assessments of status are also provided for certain species in the paper report on the basis of European or regional standards (MSY, FCS). Finally, the NL does provide an aggregated judgement on the current (not good) status of the whole marine ecosystem in its approach to defining GES. In the case of food webs, the NL refers to top predators but only in reference to large fish using the OSPAR EcoQO for large fish, which is not sufficient to cover the food web as a whole. Also no judgement has been made of the status for ecosystem functions such as productivity and structure.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

None of the criteria and indicator laid out for Descriptor 7 in the Commission Decision is incorporated in the GES definition and there is no direct or indirect reference to them (e.g. spatial scale) or justification for this gap. The Dutch definition simply reproduces the Directive definition in Annex I (although slightly different in English, the wording used in the Dutch paper report is the same as that used in the Dutch version of the Directive). 

In the text accompanying the GES definition, the NL refers to EU (Habitats and Birds Directive) and national policies and legislation already in place which have an relate to hydrographical conditions. In particular, it refers to the obligations to carry out EIAs (based on the EU requirements) in relation to sand extraction and sand suppletion. However, there is no reference to the WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters (while it is mentioned in the initial assessment).

The inclusion of socio-economic considerations in the definition of GES is not adequate, however using the current situation as a baseline for GES is in line with Commission guidance. Since the NL considers that GES is already achieved, it could be inferred that the characteristics of GES are the same as those that describe the current situation (in the initial assessment). But no independent state parameters are included in the GES definition (or the accompanying text), which would allow to assess whether GES is achieved/maintained (whatever the outcomes of the initial assessment). ;"- Only set at descriptor level (verbatim copy of Descriptor 7 from Annex I)
- No baselines or reference points";1;Inadequate
Netherlands;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The level of pressure of permanent hydrographical alterations and their impact on water column and seabed habitats are described and two large-scale projects are specifically referred to: the Delta Project (flood protection) and the Maasvlakte I (port extension). The proportion of the environment and habitats affected, trends and status assessment have all been provided. The impact on one functional group – Diadromous fish – is mentioned as well as the impact on one habitat type – H1110A/B. Land claim defence, sand and gravel mining and dredging are referred to as the main causes for hydrographical changes in the reporting sheet and the paper report looks specifically at sand extraction, sand suppletion and dredging. 

Assuming that negative effects as a result of permanent changes are irreversible, the NL considers that GES has already been achieved since the current policy will guarantee the maintenance of the present state in case of new activities. Since no thresholds have been defined, this assessment of status is merely qualitative. It is considered that there is no significant ecological impact due to permanent hydrographical changes, in line with the Environmental Impact Assessments that have been carried out and the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive. No reference is provided to OSPAR QSR 2010, but the assessment seems consistent with chapter 12 Region II (Greater North Sea).

The Netherlands has also reported on the level of pressure of marine acidification, though not in detail, specifying only which habitats and what proportion of these habitats is impacted.";The initial assessment of the NL for pressure 7 is assessed as adequate. The initial assessment includes reports on pressures and trends. It also refers to and evaluates the relevant changes, as well as the level of their impact (considered not significant), which is consistent with the changes (nature, scale) reported, the WFD reports and with OSPAR QSR. ;"- Reports on pressures and trends
- Refers to and evaluates relevant changes and level of impact of hydrographical changes
- Changes reported are consistent with those reported for the WFD and OSPAR QSR";3;Adequate
Netherlands;D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"While the targets reported by the NL in the reporting sheet and the paper report are the same, the indicators have a slightly different wording in that the term “scope” is used in the reporting sheets while the term “size” is used in the paper report (in both languages).  It is not clear why the two terms are used. In the Dutch version of the paper report, the term “size” is used and therefore considered to be the correct terminology for the set of targets/indicators for D7. 

In the paper report, the second target is labelled “operational”, which is explained by the fact that it relates to the concrete implementation of existing regulatory requirements. This second target is directly targeted to reducing impacts of human activities, provided they are submitted to regulation and sufficiently ambitious to reduce the pressure or impact to levels that will achieve (or in the case of the NL maintain) GES.

The first target however is not considered SMART. The indicators defined are those from the Commission Decision and they are not further specified in terms of threshold values or baselines/reference points or in terms of the specific ecosystem components addressed. Such a target cannot help monitor progress towards achieving/maintaining GES. The NL acknowledges that it cannot formulate quantitative targets for this descriptor

There are no conflicts between the objectives of both targets. They both relate to reducing impacts from human activities. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by the NL for D7 is assessed as adequate. Target 7a is a mere reformulation of the definition of GES and from the Commission Decision. Target 7b, however, is considered to be a SMART target, directly targeted and sufficiently ambitious to reduce impacts to level that will achieve/maintain GES.;"- Target 7a is a reformulation of the definition of GES and from the Commission Decision
- Target 7b, is considered to be a SMART target, directly targeted and sufficiently ambitious to reduce impacts to level that will achieve/maintain GES";3;Adequate
Netherlands;D7;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressure and its impact is consistent with the NL definition of GES (mostly because the definition of GES is not specific enough). 

All pressures (provided that they are covered by an adequate regulatory regime) as well as all impacts (project level/cumulative) are covered by the targets; however, it appears that the targets are only applicable to new projects (“developments”) and not to existing activities, which is consistent with the definition of GES. The set of targets is considered as sufficient to achieve GES, since it seems that the waters are already considered to be at GES and that any significant degradation would be prevented through these targets.";;;;
Netherlands;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The NL has set GES for Descriptor 8 only at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. In the reporting sheet, the NL acknowledges that GES has been set only at Descriptor level. In the paper report, the NL reports the two criteria defined in the Commission Decision “concentration of contaminants” and “effects of contaminants” but without specifying these further. The NL links its definition of GES to its setting of targets. The criteria from the Commission Decision are not used to define GES but to set targets.

In the accompanying text to its GES definition, the NL describes the existing policies already in place against contamination, including IMO regulations for dumping, OSPAR’s decision on reducing emissions, the Bonn Agreement and SEVESO II, the WFD (but not specifically the EQSD) and national policies already in place. The NL justifies not adopting a new policy for contaminants in the marine environment by referring to the initial assessment, which demonstrates that the policies in place have helped reduce concentrations of contaminants drastically since the 1970’s and should continue to do so. The NL acknowledges that achieving GES by 2020 will not be possible unless the targets within the WFD for certain substances (especially PAHs) are lowered, since the NL considers that all possible measures have already been taken. 

Through the accompanying text, it can be inferred that the NL considers GES to be the achievement of the objectives of existing policies. However, the definition of the GES itself does not contain any direct reference to threshold values and baselines for specific substances, which would specify what is meant with “levels not giving rise to pollution effects”. In the accompanying text, there is no direct specification of which substances are concerned by the GES definition (although the NL provides a few examples such as TBT and oil), which values these substances should not exceed and in which matrix the measurements should be done. The references to existing policies are not specific enough on these various points. ";The definition of GES by the NL for D8 is considered inadequate. Although the approach can be seen as pragmatic (implementing existing legislation rather than creating a new one), the complete lack of specification of the definition itself (e.g. what is meant with “levels not giving rise to pollution effects”, what substances are covered, what threshold values, etc.) means that there is no possibility to measure progress towards GES and ultimately achievement of GES. The reference to existing policies in the accompanying text is not specific enough to compensate for the lack of specification of the definition. Finally, it is not considered acceptable to set GES only at descriptor level and not specify it further at criterion or indicator level. ;"- Only set at descriptor level (verbatim copy of Descriptor 8 from Annex I)
- No baselines or reference points
- Reference to existing policies in the accompanying text are not specific enough to compensate for the lack of specification of the definition";1;Inadequate
Netherlands;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
The assessment carried out by the NL of synthetic and non-synthetic substances is done at a relatively high level of details. The NL mentions the various sources of contamination but does not quantify the input loads from these various sources or the current concentrations of contaminants in the environment or provide trends (declining or improving). Some general trends, applicable to several countries and extracted from OSPAR’s assessments, are however provided in the “limitations” field of the reporting sheet.

The assessment is a little more specific when it looks at the effects of TBT, DDT, PCB and PAH on certain species, providing past and future trends. It still does not provide any quantitative information on e.g. the proportion of a specific functional group/species affected by a substance. The NL does not address the impacts on ecosystem components of non-synthetic substances. The assessment of impacts is restricted to TBT.  The NL does not specify the non-synthetic substances assessed but mentions OSPAR assessment results for lead, cadmium and mercury. 

The NL refers extensively to existing policies in its assessment, which clearly indicates that the initial assessment, done according to MSFD Article 8, is a compilation of information collected under other processes. No additional, new assessment has been carried out specifically for the purpose of the MSFD. This is acknowledged by the NL in the reporting sheets.

The NL makes a semi-quantitative judgement on the level of contamination from synthetic and non-synthetic substances, referring to OSPAR and WFD standards. More details are provided in the limitations field about which substances are included in this judgement. It is however not conclusive with regard to the current level of, and impact from, the pressure in relation to GES. 

Radionuclides
A limited assessment of contamination by radionuclides has been carried out, mentioning the sources of contamination and referring to OSPAR’s assessment of current levels. There is a general lack of details regarding the substances assessed and the concentration levels measured. Almost no assessment of impact on ecosystem components is done. 

Acute pollution events
The NL describes in details the existing national, regional, EU and international agreements that are currently implemented to address the problem of acute pollution and mentions cooperation with neighbouring countries.  The NL reports more information in the reporting sheets than in the paper report. It provides an overview of number of events over the 2000-2010 period and trends in terms of volume of spills observed. It also provides a small description of impacts on birds and marine mammals, referring to OSPAR’s EcoQO on oiled guillemots. The NL does not make a conclusive judgement on the level of the pressure but acknowledges that the OSPAR EcoQO is not met. ";The initial assessment of contamination of the Dutch marine waters for hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered partially adequate. The NL does not report at a sufficient level of details on the level of pressure in the marine environment. Past trends are described in more details but the assessment of impacts on habitats and functional groups is limited and focused solely on TBT. The NL refers to existing policies and agreements and makes a judgement on this basis for certain parameters but does not actually conclude on the current situation in relation to GES. ;"- Level of pressure is not assessed at a sufficient level of detail
- Past trends are assessed 
- The assessment of impacts on functional groups is limited and focused solely on TBT
- Judgement on status is made using existing policies and agreements but status not assessed in relation to the GES definition";2;Partially adequate
Netherlands;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The NL has set four targets and three associated indicators to cover Descriptor 8. The last target, called “operational”, is a common qualitative target defined within OSPAR for acute pollution. Despite its lack of specification (e.g. threshold value, baseline, indicator), the inclusion of this target by NL means a certain level of coherence with neighbouring countries.

The targets cover all aspects of Descriptor 8 (concentration and effects of contaminants and acute pollution event) except radionuclides, which is expected at this stage. The first three targets (and their associated indicators) are quantified, though not directly but through reference to the WFD and OSPAR standards and they are time-bound (either 2020 or the WFD timeline). They refer to the appropriate EU and RSC standards and criteria (WFD targets and OSPAR’s CEMP and EcoQOs) and explain in the accompanying text that the two measurement methods (WFD and OSPAR) should be used jointly in areas where the WFD and OSPAR overlap. They recognize that this may lead to diverging results and conclude that this is an area where more work is needed within the EU. They also refer to the Commission’s “Technical Guidance for Deriving Environmental Quality Standards” developed in 2011 for the WFD which contains specific guidance on the derivation of EQS for freshwater and saltwater. The targets are relatively specific although the contaminants covered by targets 8a and 8b are not provided.

Contrary to the other indicators, the associated indicator on effects of TBT does not specify a threshold value for the achievement of the target. However, it directly refers to the OSPAR EcoQO for imposex, which should be specific enough. It should be noted that the NL has not set a target following the OSPAR EcoQO on the levels of hazardous substances in seabird eggs. It should also be noted that the indicator for oil-smeared beached birds differs from the EcoQO since it refers to a limit value of 20% of the beached guillemots while the OSPAR EcoQO refers to 10% of the total found dead or dying (over a period of 5 years). The Dutch target is therefore less ambitious than the OSPAR one. 

Target 8d is not specific since there is no detail on what is meant with “minimised” (no quantitative trend provided). This target is defined more as a GES statement than an actual target. It is the only target however that is aimed at controlling human activities. ";The set of targets defined by the NL to cover Descriptor 8 is considered as partially adequate. It is measurable and quantified except for one target on acute pollution. It refers to the relevant EU and RSC standards and is time-bound. However, it lacks certain details (e.g. contaminants concerned, definition of the terms “reduce” (target 8b)) and is not very ambitious (e.g. less stringent target than OSPAR EcoQO). ;"- All targets except one on acute pollution are measurable and quantified
- Targets refer to the relevant EU and RSC standards
- Targets are time bound
- Targets lack details (e.g. contaminants concerned, definition of the terms “reduce” (target 8b) and “minimised” (target 8d)) and are not very ambitious (e.g. less stringent target than OSPAR EcoQO)";2;Partially adequate
Netherlands;D8;Consistency ;;"There is no apparent inconsistency between the description of the level of pressure from contaminants and the GES definition. The lack of specificity regarding the definition of GES for contaminants effects is reflected in the limited reporting on this aspect for the initial assessment. 

The set of targets and indicators are consistent with the pressures reported in the initial assessment. They do address contaminant effects to a larger extent than what is done for the IA. It is also considered sufficient to achieve GES considering that GES is restricted to concentration of contaminants and both GES and targets use the same standards. ";;;;
Netherlands;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The NL has set GES for Descriptor 9 only at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. In the reporting sheet, the NL acknowledges that GES has been set only at Descriptor level. In the paper report, the NL reports the criterion defined in the Commission Decision on “levels, number and frequency of pollutants” but without specifying it further. As for other descriptors, the NL links it definition of GES to its setting of targets and uses the criterion and indicators of the Commission Decision in the setting of targets rather than for the specification of the definition of GES. 

In the accompanying text to its GES definition, the NL describes the policies already in place, which target contamination in fish and seafood. This includes mainly the relevant European legislation in this regard as well as national legislation. Direct reference is made to Regulations 1881/2006, 1259/2011, 396/2005, and 3954/87 and to the substances these regulations target (lead, cadmium and mercury, dioxins/furans and dioxin-like PCBs, and benzo(a)pyrene, PCBs, pesticides, radioactive substances). Through the accompanying text, it can be inferred that the NL considers GES to be the achievement (or maintaining) of the objectives of existing policies. This is justified by the initial assessment, which has concluded that, through the implementation of these policies, GES is already achieved in the Dutch marine waters when it comes to the contamination of fish and seafood. 

No reference is made to OSPAR, which is explained by the fact that OSPAR has not worked on this issue. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. The GES definition (as stated in the Directive) directly refers to Community legislation and NL has specified further the relevant EU Regulations (and related substances) covered by its GES. The GES definition is therefore measurable and specific when read in conjunction with the accompanying text. However, because the actual GES definition is not further specified at the level of criterion and indicators, it cannot be considered as fully adequate. ;"- Only set at descriptor level (verbatim copy of Descriptor 9 from Annex I)
- The GES definition in Annex I of the MSFD refers to EU legislation and is thereby sufficient
- As the Dutch GES definition is not further specified at the level of criterion and indicators, it cannot be considered as fully adequate";2;Partially adequate
Netherlands;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the reporting sheets, the NL has systematically mentioned that the field concerning the impacts from hazardous substances on fish and other seafood was not included in the reporting sheets that were discussed in WG DIKE of the CIS. Therefore, the NL did not report any information on this in the reporting sheet. However, in the paper report, the NL describes the method used for the monitoring of contaminants in fish and seafood. It provides the list of the types of substances for which maximum levels have been set and which are monitored by the relevant Dutch authority (heavy metals, dioxin-like substances, organo-chloro pesticides, PCBs, TCPM(e) (Tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol and methane), brominated flame retardants, and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)) and the species covered by this monitoring (mussels, shrimp and some twenty commercially exploited fish species). 

This assessment should be seen in conjunction with the more general assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, in particular in relation to the sources of contamination and the marine activities causing the pressure. The NL provides a short assessment of the level of radionuclides in the environment but does not refer specifically to their impacts on fish and seafood. The NL makes reference to the relevant EU legislation (including recent amendments to Regulation 1881/2006) and to national legislation. It also makes reference to OSPAR in relation to contamination by radionuclides.

The NL does not make a conclusive judgement that the current status is good but this is implied when NL states that measurements indicate that the maximum levels of contaminants in fish and other seafood are not exceeded at the moment. 

The NL has reported on microbial pathogens (only in the reporting sheet). The NL notes that no specific GES criteria exist for microbial pathogens (reporting sheet, pressures) . The relevant types of water are assessed (bathing waters and shellfish waters). All geographical areas are covered. The judgement on the level of pressure and its impact is in line with the information reported. ";The initial assessment of the contamination by hazardous substances of fish and other seafood (including contamination by microbial pathogens) is considered adequate. The NL provides information regarding the substances monitored and refers to the relevant legislation. No conclusive judgement is made but it can be inferred and is directly related to the GES definition for D9. The status in relation to microbial pathogen contamination has been assessed in relation to the Bathing Water Directive and the Shellfish Directive and is considered as good.;"- Information on monitored substances provided
- No conclusive judgement made but it can be inferred directly from the GES definition";3;Adequate
Netherlands;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The NL has defined one target and four associated indicators to cover Descriptor 9. The set of the target and its indicators is specific and measurable (except for the last indicator which is not measurable). In line with the approach adopted for other descriptors, the indicators set for environmental targets correspond to the indicators defined in the Commission Decision with an additional indicator on the source of contamination. Target 9 refers to national and international legislation. It is not clear why it does not refer to Community legislation, as the GES definition does, but it can be inferred that international legislation includes the relevant EU regulation. The accompanying text to the target/indicators does not specify further which national and international legislation are included but this is specified in the reporting sheets. The accompanying text makes reference to the types of substances covered by the targets and the species monitored by the current annual monitoring programme. It is not explicitly stated that these parameters are the same as those addressed by the target/indicators but it can also be extrapolated. 

What is not clear from the Dutch reporting of target/indicators for D9 is the actual threshold values and the baselines or reference points associated with these. In the reporting sheets, the NL notes that the baseline for the measurement of the indicators is the current state but still does not set threshold values. The NL specifies in the paper report that the indicators are “existing indicators”. It is not clear what this refers to and in particular if it refers to an existing national legislation/policy where such thresholds would be already stated.";The set of targets defined by the NL to cover Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. While the target/indicators are specific and potentially measurable, the lack of threshold values for the indicators means that it is not possible to actually assess the achievement of the target and renders the indicators effectively useless. ;"- Targets and indicators are specific and potentially measurable
- No threshold values for indicators
- Achievement of targets cannot be determined due to the lack of thresholds";2;Partially adequate
Netherlands;D9;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressures and impacts is fully consistent with the definition of GES although it should be noted that no assessment has been made on the contamination of radionuclides in fish and seafood. 

The set of environmental targets and associated indicators is consistent with the assessment of the impacts of contamination on fish and seafood in that it addresses the same substances monitored in the same species., with the exception of the last indicator on the source of contamination, which does not relate to a particular parameter addressed in the 2012 initial assessment.

The set of the target and its indicators is also not fully consistent with the GES definition since it includes monitoring of certain parameters, such as the frequency with which the applicable limits are exceeded, which are not at all addressed by the definition of GES. Such an indicator would be consistent with GES (and the initial assessment) only if it included a notion of diminution of this frequency to zero levels or the maintenance of a current zero-level frequency. This applies also to the third indicator on the number of contaminants that exceed limits. ";;;;
Poland;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has reproduced the Annex I MSFD definition and the criteria and indicators provided in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. Poland has also reported additional indicators and the properties of GES which provide thresholds for the additional indicators provided. As a set the additional indicators are reported as addressing criteria 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 and indicators 1.2.1, 1.3.1, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.6.1, 1.6.2, 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 of the Commission Decision. Criteria 1.1, 1.4 and indicators 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.3.2, 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 are not addressed by any of the additional indicators.

The additional Polish indicators cover all the relevant species groups, fish, birds and marine mammals as well as benthic and water column habitats (cephalopods are not relevant for the Baltic). The status of birds is assessed using only the HELCOM core indicator on the productivity of white tailed eagles. This fails to address the different categories of seabirds (e.g. offshore surface-feeding birds) or relevant parameters such as population size. In the case of marine mammals, Poland applies the three HELCOM indicators: population growth rate, the nutritional status of seals (i.e. layer of fatty tissue of marine mammals) and the pregnancy rate of marine mammals. These indicators cover population attributes for seals and harbour porpoises and population condition for seals. Poland has however not defined GES thresholds for any of the marine mammal indicators meaning that these indicators are not yet operational. In the case of fish, Poland has also decided to rely on the HELCOM CORE indicators: these include the large fish indicator (LFI), abundance of key fish species and abundance of fish key functional groups. These indicators cover both marine and coastal fish quite comprehensively except for data on distribution. Several of the indicators for fish are however missing thresholds and are therefore not yet operational.

At habitat level Poland has addressed both benthic and pelagic habitats using indicators that are mostly meant for assessing eutrophication such as the biomass ratio of perennial species and water transparency. The zooplankton and the multimetric indicator of macrozoobenthos B are part of HELCOM’s core indicators for biodiversity but have a strong focus on assessing the effects of eutrophication. Poland has not made reference to the criteria of habitat extent and distribution and to the Habitats and Birds Directives. No thresholds are defined for the zooplankton indicator. The indicators defined for both benthic and pelagic habitats are not comprehensive and mostly suitable for monitoring the effects of eutrophication.

At ecosystem level, criterion 1.7 as defined by Poland refers to the trophic structure of the fish community, this captures only a portion of the ecosystem and is not sufficient to assess the status of the ecosystem as a whole.";The GES definition for Descriptor 1 by Poland is considered as partially adequate. Poland has reproduced the GES as defined in Annex I of the MSFD as well as the criteria and indicators as provided in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. Poland has then defined a set of additional indicators of which are predominantly based on the HELCOM CORE indicators for biodiversity. Together these indicators cover all relevant species groups as well as benthic and pelagic habitats but the coverage benthic habitats and birds in particular is very limited. Furthermore there are currently no thresholds for many of the indicators including all those defined for marine mammals. Poland makes very superficial reference to the Habitats and Birds Directives and does not address habitat distribution nor species distribution. The use of HELCOM CORE indicators is however encouraging.;"- Makes good use of HELCOM CORE indicators
'- Selected HELCOM indicators include all relevant species groups and both benthic and pelagic habitats
- Yet, coverage of benthic habitats and birds is very limited

- Does not address habitat distribution, habitat extent and species distribution";2;Partially adequate
Poland;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
In the reporting sheets, Poland has reported on species groups, functional groups and individual species. The Member States carries out the majority of its assessment on birds. It makes an assessment of wintering birds and the white tailed eagle.
In the paper report, information is provided on the following indicators: copepod biomass and biomass, abundance of key species of fish, number of fry and smolt for salmon and trout, number of fish species and fish functional groups, amount of large fish. None of these indicators were used in this initial assessment due to the lack of data. The use of the Large Fish Index in the open sea is reported in the paper report but not reported in the reporting sheets.

White-tailed eagle productivity was used by the Member State to make an assessment of the breeding success of a high level predator. The assessment was carried out using data from the years 2005-2009, which allows for good trend analyses. The geographic area used for the assessment is not specified, and the Member State simple reports to have done the assessment “along the Baltic coastline”. On the basis of these data, three indicators have been used for the assessment: productivity, success of breeding, size of breeding. Poland uses the threshold value of one successful bred chick per year. All years reported values over one – from 1.47 in 2005 to 1.33 in 2009; the breeding success has also gone from 68% in 2005 to 75% in 2009. Thus, GES was considered to be achieved for all of the years since the programme began. One note of caution with this study is that sampling size has decreased over the years from 24 in 2005 to 4 in 2009. This is worrying because smaller sample size means less accurate results.

The core indicator number of wintering seabirds takes into account the number of selected species in the functional groups ‘pelagic inshore birds’, ‘pelagic offshore birds’ and ‘benthic inshore birds’. The species used for the assessment include: Gavia stellate, Gavia arctica, Podiceps auritus, Podiceps grisegena, Clangula hyemalis, Melanitta fusca, Melanitta nigra, Cepphus grille, Alca torda, Uria aalge, Podiceps cristatus, Larus marinus, Larus canus, Larus ridibundus, Larus argentatus.

The data used for the assessment was linked to the HELCOM CORESET project and dates back from 2010-2011. This rather short period does not allow for trend analyses. The threshold value of 69.16 sighting per km2 has been used to make a judgment in relation to GES. This seems to be an average of the two years of data. In 2010, there were a total of 54.37 sightings per km2 and in 2011 there were 83.95 sightings per km2. Based on this data, Poland has made a judgment that GES has been achieved for this indicator (although it is not the case for 2010). Each of the coastal areas were considered to have achieved GES, apart from the Polish part of the Szczecin Lagoon.

In the Polish paper report, the Large Fish Index (LFI) in the open ocean is used to show the proportion of large fish (cod over 30cm) in the water column. This is a HELCOM CORE indicator and it was used to make an assessment in the ICES subdivisions 25 and 26 as part of the BITS survey. Poland provides details on fishing mortality and LFI monitored from 2006-2011. The assessment shows high fisheries mortality and low LFI for the years 2006-2008, while for there is a high LFI for the years 2009-2011 This means there are lower fisheries mortality and a higher proportion of large fish in the water. As a result of this the Poland entire offshore waters relieve GES.
If it is assumed that the LFI covers the functional group ‘demersal fish’, combined with the assessment of wintering birds, the initial assessment from Poland has covered 4 of the 19 functional groups that are relevant to Polish waters.

Habitats
Poland has carried out an initial assessment of the habitats in the Baltic Sea. The assessment is mostly qualitative and covers only one seabed habitat type: littoral sediment. The information reported by Poland is more comprehensive and developed in the paper report than in the reporting sheets. The majority of the reporting in the paper report is concerned with descriptions of the methods used.
For the assessment of the status of the habitat type, Poland used the ratio of biomass perennial species to the total biomass of macrophyte (SM index). Poland uses the WFD threshold value of SM > 80 as GES threshold. Multi-sample points in each of the four marine areas were assessed. During the initial assessment carried out 2010-2011, the Puck bay area received the highest value with 70 and the Eastern waters of the Gothland Basin received 53. None of Poland waters were assessed as being above the GES threshold for the SM index.

Poland also carried out an assessment of certain habitat types based on the multimeric macrozoobenthos index. This was carried out for littoral sediment and soft bottom (sandy, sandy-muddy and silty) habitats in all eight Polish areas. The assessment was done using the HELCOM HOLAS methods and the threshold value for B =3.18 was used as GES threshold. The coastal water of the Gulf of Gdansk received the highest value 3.04 while the polish part of Vistula lagoon received the lowest values 1.75. Thus, none of the areas were assessed as being at or above the threshold for GES.

Ecosystems
Poland has not reported on ecosystem features in the reporting sheets.
In the paper report, the Member State provides the same information that was described above for habitats. Thus, Poland concludes that its marine areas are not at GES, based on an assessment of the multimeric macrozoobenthos index and the ratio of biomass perennial species to the total biomass of macrophyte.";The initial assessment by Poland of biological features is considered partially adequate. Only two predominant habitat types and a number of special habitats are reported. Species groups are generally better covered. Although the information reported is mostly qualitative and not very detailed, some parameters are quantified. Judgements on status were only provided in some cases. Reference is made to HELCOM, ICES and to the Habitats Directive.;"Features:
- Only two predominant habitat types and a number of special habitats are reported; species groups are generally better covered
- The information reported is mostly qualitative and not very detailed but some parameters are quantified

Poland;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Poland has defined targets for GES overall and for the different criteria and indicators of Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. The Polish targets however in some cases do not apply the same indicators or concepts for the targets as those used to define GES, even though both the reporting for Art. 9 and 10 is structured using the Commission Decision.

The GES definition for indicator 1.2.1 for example refers to the growth rate of marine mammals while the target for indicator 1.2.1 refers to population fluctuations of wintering seabirds. In the case of indicator 1.3.1 the target indicators that Poland has defined include a number of seabird indicators with thresholds that are not part of the GES definition. Furthermore indicators 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 are mentioned as part of GES but are not addressed under Art. 10 targets. In many ways however the targets go beyond what is required to achieve the GES as reported under Art. 9.

The targets contain both general and more specific targets. The general targets refer to reducing anthropogenic pressure, such as fisheries, the introduction of NIS and trawling and maintaining or improving the status of species and habitats protected under the Birds and Habitats Directive. Some, but not all, of these general targets are accompanied by indicators. The reported indicators for example cover bird and marine mammal by-catch and trends of endangered biota, but not the amount of area affected by trawling or NIS. As a result, not all the relevant pressures that would be relevant to the targets are addressed by indicators to monitor progress in reducing their level of pressure. As a result, the targets are not fully measurable and therefore not SMART.";"The Polish targets covering Descriptor 1 are considered partially adequate. The targets address the relevant species groups and also cover seabed and water column habitats. The approach to setting the targets however is not always clear and some of the pressures relevant to the targets are not addressed by indicators (e.g. seafloor disturbance/trawling, NIS). Furthermore, some indicators lack threshold values. Lastly while Poland uses the Commission Decision for reporting both Art. 9 and 10 the national indicators and approaches do not always match the Commission Decision indicators; therefore, it is not always clear how the targets will lead to the achievement of GES.";"- Targets cover the relevant species groups, seabed and water column habitats

Poland;D1;Consistency ;;Both the reporting for GES (Art. 9) and the targets (Art. 10) is structured using the Commission Decision 2010/477/EU, nonetheless there are some significant discrepancies between the approaches for defining GES and setting the targets.

Poland;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has reported the Annex I GES definition for Descriptor 10 and reproduced the indicators as provided in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. At the indicator level, Poland reports an additional version for indicator 10.1.1 “waste on shoreline” and states that for the other Commission Decision indicators, the Polish GES indicators have not been developed. Therefore, Poland has only operationalised indicator 10.1.1 for Descriptor 10.
The characteristics of GES for indicator 10.1.1 are reported as 1 large/medium piece of marine litter and 6 small pieces of litter per km as a threshold for GES.

Poland;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The initial assessment is primarily based on the monitoring of litter on the coastline. The indicator used to assess good status by Poland is the amount of litter on the shore; 1 large/medium piece of marine litter and 6 small pieces of litter per km as a threshold for GES. Ten segments of the coastline were selected along the polish coastline from 5km to 35 km for sampling.                                                                                                                                                                             Only a small amount of gathered data in one season was insufficient to set trends. The main activities causing the pressure are reported to be tourism and recreational activities. The amount of litter found in the sampled segments varied from 1.4 to 2.7 large pieces of litter per km and 6.9 to 19 small pieces of litter per km. Each of these segments have been assessed on a scale from 1 to 5. The results were then compiled to represent each of the assessment areas. Both coastlines of the Gulf of Gdansk and Bornholm Basin received a moderate status. The Polish part of the Vistula Lagoon received a ‘not good’ status while all other areas got a weak rating (2 out of 5). Hence none of the areas achieved GES as they did not pass the threshold.
Poland recognises that there are currently gaps in its assessment. They have proposed another four core indicators for litter. However, they were not able to elaborate due to insufficient data. Polish sea waters have not been assessed for solid litter in the water column or on the seabed. Amount and composition of micro-particles and effects of litter on marine animals are difficult to estimate.";The assessment by Poland of the pressure from marine litter is considered partially adequate. Poland has made an assessment of current status in relation to GES for beach litter but not water column litter, micro-plastics and ingested litter due to a lack of data.

Poland;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has reported the GES definition as defined in Annex I of the MSFD. At criteria and indicator levels, Poland deviates significantly from Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. In relation to indicators 11.1.1, 11.2.1 and 11.2.2 Poland distinguishes between impulsive and continuous low frequency sounds but the reported indicators lack details, such as the frequency bands of sound addressed by the indicator. Furthermore, the way criteria 11.1 and 11.2 are phrased seems to indicate that these indicators are only intended to be assessed in relation to their impact on marine mammals; both impulsive loud noise and continuous low frequency noise can however have a wide range of effects on many different species groups other than marine mammals. No GES thresholds are defined for either indicator 11.2.1 or 11.2.2.
Poland has also defined two additional criteria and indicators dealing with electromagnetic fields and anthropogenic heat which is a good practice; no thresholds are defined for either heat or electromagnetic fields and in the column “group of indicators” it refers to underwater noise rather than the relevant pressures.";The GES definition of Poland for D11 is assessed as partially adequate. Poland has defined very general indicators for impulsive and ambient noise and does not use those indicators provided in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. Furthermore from the Polish reporting it can be understood that underwater noise will only be assessed in relation to marine mammals, however various other animals species can also be affected by underwater noise.

Poland;D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Poland has defined three targets: a general target, a target to address criterion 1.1 and a target to address criterion 1.2. The first target consists of two parts, first data collection in order to determine whether underwater noise is negatively affecting marine life and second to reduce the pressure of underwater noise at a later point in the future.
The target for criterion 11.2 is to reduce harmful ambient noise by identifying those vessels generating the most noise and then reducing the sound they produce. The indicators hint that a noise registry might be established but it is nonetheless unclear that Poland will follow the recommendation of the MSFD Task Group 11 to establish a noise registry.
Finally, the targets do not address heat or electromagnetic waves which are forms of energy that are included in the Polish GES definition.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Poland for D11 is assessed as inadequate.

Poland;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has defined GES for D2 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. Poland has reproduced the Descriptor 2 definition as provided in Annex I of the Directive and the criteria and indicators as provided in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU.
Poland has defined an additional simplified indicator replacing the indicator 2.1.1 of the Commission Decision along with a threshold stating that GES is achieved when no new non-native species are introduced into Polish waters. As Poland clarified, this threshold was defined during the initial assessment as part of the national GES definition. The threshold of ‘no new introductions’ meets the minimum requirements of no further NIS increases. The Polish GES definition does not provide threshold values for indicators 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 but states that this is temporary, and that these will be provided in the future.";"The GES definition for D2 is considered as partially adequate.

Poland;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"For the initial assessment, Poland reports at both species level and functional group level. There are a total of 28 potential NIS species in the Polish water. Poland has provided limited information with regards to pressure and activities. Invasive species have been reported throughout Poland marine waters. The number of NIS per area reported in the reporting sheets is as follows;
Gulf of Gdansk Offshore waters: 9
Gulf of Gdansk Polish: 14
Bornholm Basin Offshore waters: 1
Bornholm Basin Polish Coastal waters: 2
Eastern Baltic Proper Polish Coastal waters: 1
Vistula Lagoon (Polish part): 21
Szczecin Lagoon (Polish part): 21
In the paper report Poland clarifies that the area of the Gulf of Gdansk is the most affected by NIS while the least affected is reported to be the Vistula Lagoon. In the paper report, Poland provides an inventory of 30 NIS categorised according to their functional group:
- Three species of phytoplankton (Alexandrium ostenfeldii, Prorocentrum minimum, Pseudochattonella farcimen)
- Two species of marcroyphyte (Elodea Canadensis, Chara connivens)
- Three species of zooplankton (Acartia tonsa, Cercopagis pengoi, Mnemiopsis leidyi)
- Nineteen species of zoobenthos (Anguillicola crassus, Balanus improvises, Cordylophora caspia, Chaetogammarus ischnus, Chelicorophium Curvispinum, Dikerogammarus villosus, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, Dreissena polymorph, Eriocheir sinensi, Gammarus tigrinus, Hemimysis anomala, Hypania invalida, Lithoglyphus naticoides, Marenzelleria Neglecta, Mya arenari, Obesogammarus crassus, Orconectes limosus, Palaemon elegans, Pontogammarus Robustoides, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Rhithropanopeus harrisi)
- One species of bird (Branta Canadensi)
This information comes from the combined findings of the HELCOM COMBINE and WFD activities. Additional information in the paper report is result for desk review of pulished inforamation on NIS in Polish waters.
Based on information from 26 species in the paper report, four species were confirmed as reproducing, five species were confirmed as present but no evidence of reproduction was found and the status of the remaining species is uncertain due to a lack of information. Information on date of introduction is provided. Regarding pathways of introduction, shipping is identified for three NIS (Cordylophora caspia, Balanus improvises, Eriocheir sinensis) and aquaculture for one NIS (Dikerogammarus villosus) but not for others. Poland does not provide any information on the effect of the NIS pressure on other ecosystem components.
There is no detailed description of information gaps and plans to address them. As information was compiled on the presence of NIS in marine waters over the length of a study (between 2008 and 2011), it should be possible in the future to do trend analysis. In paper report Poland reports that a full initial assessment will be carried out for the years 2012 – 2017.";The initial assessment for the pressure ‘introduction of non-indigenous species’ is considered partially adequate. Poland has provided a list of 30 NIS and also reports how many species of NIS are found in various Polish waterbodies. It has also reported the dates that the species were found/arrived, which is useful for identifying trends. Poland has identified shipping and aquaculture as the main vectors of NIS spread. Finally, it has made a status assessment for littoral sediment which was found to be in ‘not good’ status.

Poland;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Poland has defined, for Descriptor 2, a set of targets linked to the GES criteria and indicators. The set of targets is more developed in the paper report than in the reporting sheets but they essentially cover the same elements.        The general targets (i.e. not those linked to indicators) focus on preventing alterations to the ecosystem by NIS, the collection of relevant data, minimizing introductions, reducing the impact of NIS and having no new introductions of harmful NIS. In relation to indicator 2.1.1, the target aims for no introduction of a new alien species. This threshold for this target of no new introductions is in line with the minimum requirements, however the general target for criterion 2.1 is to ‘minimize introductions’. The indicator target is, therefore, more ambitious but it is unclear to what extent it takes precedence over the general target. The rest of the general target, about understanding the vectors of introduction, is not measurable.
In relation to indicator 2.2.1, four achievement criteria (in the form of questions) are provided which each apply to different taxonomic groups, including fish, macroalgae and molluscs. It is stated that the target for indicator 2.2.1 is achieved if there are less than three positive answers to the four criteria/questions in relation to the specific taxonomic groups. This seems a rather arbitrary approach and the Polish approach in this regard does not take into account the severity of those cases where thresholds are exceeded. In relation to indicator 2.2.2, the target aims to have no emergence of new invasive species with destructive effects over the previous six-year period. The scope of this target is not entirely clear, in particular in relation to the target for criterion 2.1 which aims to have no new introduction of any new invasive species (presumably including those that have adverse effects on the environment). It also poses the question what criteria will be used to determine whether species have destructive effects on the environment. Furthermore, this target does not take into account the harmful effects of already established NIS but this aspect can be considered addressed by the goal for indicator 2.2.1.
Poland specifies a timeline as it states that all targets should be achieved by 2020, i.e. at the same time as GES.";The environmental targets and associated indicators are considered as partially adequate to achieve GES. The set of targets addresses introductions and impacts of NIS and also contains a number of measurable thresholds. The target of Poland to minimise introductions is not sufficient to achieve GES. Finally, in the case of indicator 2.2.1 the method to aggregate the results and determine if the target is achieved should take into account not only whether no more than a certain number of thresholds are exceeded but also the severity of the situation in those cases where a threshold is exceeded.;"- Targets address introductions and impacts of NIS
- Targets contain a number of measurable thresholds
- Targets not SMART and contain some inconsistencies
- The Polish target definition to minimise NIS introductions is not sufficient to achieve GES and is not SMART";2;Partially adequate
Poland;D2;Consistency ;;The Polish reporting for Descriptor 2 is generally consistent as both the GES and targets are based on Commission Decision 2010/477/EU.;;;;
Poland;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has defined GES for D3 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. Poland has reproduced the GES definition from Annex I of the MSFD and all the criteria and most of the indicators from Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. Poland has defined criterion 3.1 for six species, GES is achieved when fishing mortality (F) is at or below MSY and fishing mortality is either stable or showing a significant decreasing trend. Based on the assessment methodology the trend based assessment methodology could conflict with the objective to exploit all stocks at or below Fmsy because stable or significant downward trends do not have to mean that exploitation levels are at or below MSY.
In relation to criterion 3.2, Poland covers indicator 3.2.1 in its GES definition but not indicator 3.2.2. For two stocks, Poland has defined GES as being achieved when stock biomass is at or above Bmsy-trigger. For all six species, Poland defines GES as achieved when there is a significant upward trend or a lack of a trend for stock biomass. Even if there is an upward trend or a lack of trend it does not necessarily mean that the stock is at Bmsy-trigger or at a sustainable level, therefore this might be inconsistent with the previous part of the definition.
Finally, Poland reports that it covers indicator 3.3.2 in relation to criterion 3.3 but not indicators 3.3.1, 3.3.3 and 3.3.4. However, the definition for indicator 3.3.2 as reported by Poland corresponds to indicator 3.3.3 of Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. It states that GES is achieved when there is no upward trend for the 95th percentile of fish length distribution observed during research surveys.
While Poland addresses all three criteria they are only applied to the six main fish stocks in the Baltic. The MSFD and the CFP however require that all commercially exploited stocks are exploited at or below Fmsy which can be expanded to include freshwater species that reside within the Baltic such as Perch, bream and Pike.";The Polish GES definition is considered partially adequate. Poland has defined GES for all three criteria of Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. The GES definition requires stocks to be exploited at or below Fmsy and stocks to be at Bmsy-trigger. However, the GES definition also includes trend-based thresholds which can conflict with the MSY-based thresholds and which might not meet the minimum requirements that all stocks are exploited at Fmsy and remain within safe biological limits. Furthermore, the thresholds are applied to the main commercially exploited stocks but the MSFD and CFP requires that all stocks are exploited at or below MSY principles.;"- GES requires stocks to be exploited at or below Fmsy and stocks to at Bmsy-trigger which is in line with the minimum requirements                               GES contains trend based thresholds that might not meet the minimum requirements

Poland;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the reporting sheets, Poland provides an assessment for each of the commercially important stocks. For the assessment Poland have reported Internationl Council for Exporation of the Sea subdivisions (fig.1). TheMember State reports to monitor the Western (22-24 – see figure 1) and Eastern cod (25-32) Gladus Morpha stocks , the Western flounder stock Platichthys flesus (24-25), the stock of sprat Sprattus sprattus (22-32), the Western (22-24) and Central stocks of herring Clupea harengus (25-29).                                                                                                                   Additional and more detailed information is provided in the paper report. Also in the paper report basic tonnage information is provided on the less commercially important stocks (bream, perch, eel, blue bream, whitefish, turbot, pike, tench, garfish and perch). General information on ships and fleets has not been provided but Poland states that, within the Vistula and Szczecin Lagoon, fishing is carried out by a fleet of smaller boats, that targets less commercially important stocks. It is also clarified that boats smaller than 12 take part in common caught quota schemes for certain species.
In the reporting sheets, all the assessed stocks are reported to be exploited at “20%” by fisheries, however, it is not clear what the percentage represents. The paper report provides more detailed information on sustainable stock biomass, fishing mortality, landings and recruitment. The sprat Sprattus sprattus stock (22-32) shows a trend of decreasing landings and recruitment levels since 1997. In recent years, the exploitation of the stock has stabilised with fishing mortality falling to lower than fishing at precautionary approach level (Fpa) and fishing at maximum sustainable yield level (Fmsy). A similar trend and current status are observed for the Western herring Clupea harengus stock (22-24), Western cod Gladus Mopha stock (22-24) and Easetern cod Gladus Mopha stock (25-32), although the date of peak production (date from when the stocks biomass starts to fall) varies between stocks. The central Herring Clupea harengus (25-29) stock differs, in that it is currently being exploited above Fpa and Fmsy. Less information is provided for western flounder Platichthys flesus (24-25) but it is reported that in recent years fishing mortality is at a level less than sustainable stock biomass level.
Poland reports that the Eastern cod Gladus Mopha stock (25-32), the Western herring Clupea harengus stock 22-24, the sprat Sprattus sprattus stock (22-32) and Western flounder stock Platichthys flesus (24-25) have achieved good environmental status. For the remaining stocks (Central herring Clupea harengus (25-29), Western cod Gladus Mopha (22-24), there is a lack of reported information (in particular in relation to Fmsy, SSB and Fpa). Overall the majority of Polish marine water are assessed as not good or not at GES when it comes to commercial fish and shellfish as fish and shellfish in the area are currently being exploited at level that are not within safe biological limits. The areas of the Vistula and Szczecin Lagoons were not assessed due to the lack of information. Poland does not report on shellfish, and any other commercially exploited species, such as for example salmon (Salmo salaris). Poland recognised that they currently have a number of gaps in their assessment due to the lack of information. They do not present any plans for the filling of these gaps.";The Polish initial assessment is considered adequate. Poland has reported on the status of the most important commercially exploited stocks of marine species and in the paper report also provides data on the amount of freshwater species harvested in tons. Poland has also made an overall judgement on the status of GES which is indicated as 'not good'. One issue is that Poland has not provided information on the size of fishing fleets.

Poland;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has reproduced the Annex I MSFD definition and the criteria and indicators provided in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. Poland has then defined separate indicators which address criteria 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 and indicators 4.1.1, 4.2.1 and 4.3.1 covering all the Commission Decision Descriptor 4 criteria and indicators.

The Polish indicators are based on HELCOM core indicators and are also reported under Descriptor 1 except for the indicator “number of wintering seabirds” which is only reported under Descriptor 4. Although named slightly different this indicator corresponds with the HELCOM CORE indicator “abundance of waterbirds in the wintering season.” The selected HELCOM indicators correspond well with the criteria and indicators as defined in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU.

In the case of criterion 4.3, coverage could be expanded to include groups with fast turnover rates, habitat defining groups/species and diadromous species; it should be noted that there are HELCOM CORE indicators that can address these. Lastly it should be noted that for marine mammals the Polish indicator currently does not defined threshold and is therefore not yet operational.

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Therefore, these two indicators are not suitable to assess whether the biomass of key trophic groups remain at levels that ensure full reproductive capacity of the population.

National Report: Poland
provided in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU, except for indicators 5.2.2 and 5.2.4. Poland has also reported two additional indicators that are not part of the Commission Decision (5.3.1 and 5.3.4) and changed the numbering of one indicator from 5.3.1 in the Commission Decision to 5.3.2 in the Polish reporting.
Poland has provided additional indicators to specify each Commission Decision indicator and reported the properties of GES which provide thresholds for most of the additional indicators. As specified in the reporting sheets, the additional indicators are based on the HELCOM TARGREV (e.g. Winter DIN) and WFD (Multimetric indicator macrozoobenthos) assessments. Poland does not specifically refer to the WFD or HELCOM in the GES definition in the paper report, but mentions HELCOM in the reporting sheets.
Indicators 5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.5, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 have defined thresholds which address nutrient, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen concentrations, opportunistic macroalgae and macrozoobenthos.";The GES definition of Poland for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The GES definition covers nutrient, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen concentrations and macrozoobenthos. These indicators are accompanied by thresholds against which to assess GES. The indicators also cover macrophytes but no thresholds are defined and therefore these indicators are not operational.;"- Addresses nutrient, chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen
- Addressess macrozoobenthos and macrophytes
- Does not address shifts in floristic composition
- Definition contains thresholds for most but not all indicators against which to assess GES";2;Partially adequate
Poland;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Poland has carried out an initial assessment on the level of pressures and the status of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea, using different assessment areas and presenting mainly descriptive information, although some quantification is provided (at least in the paper report). The assessment is based on existing information and the level of detail varies depending on the area or parameter assessed.
The assessment covers loads and concentrations of the relevant nutrients – nitrogen and phosphorus. Poland uses the HELCOM CORE indicators to measure eutrophication e.g. dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), Total nitrogen (TN), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), total phosphorus (TP), water transparency, chlorophyll average, total biomass of phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen, dissolved oxygen at the bottom, etc. Nutrients and transparency are measured to get summer, winter and annual average values for accurate information on the year long timescale. Each indicator is assessed against a threshold value for good status. The threshold values differ by area depending on the eutrophication dynamics in that water body.
On this basis, Poland has made a number of judgments on the current status of eutrophication in its marine waters. For example, the annual average total nitrogen TN is assessed as being ‘not good’ in all areas apart from the Szezecin Lagoon area while annual average total phosphorus TP is assessed as being in good status in all areas apart from Eastern part of Gothland Basin and Gulf of Gdansk Polish Coastal waters. The main causes of pressure reported include agriculture, forestry, urban discharges, industry, solid waste disposal and fisheries. There is no information provided on trends.
The assessment also includes (mainly qualitative) information on the impacts of eutrophication on both water column and seabed habitats. The Member State reports that the assessment of pressures on benthic habitat is carried out as part of the assessment done for the biodiversity descriptors (D1 and D6), using zoobentos bio-multimetric index. They are assessed in a similar a fashion to nutrients.
To assess if a marine area is at GES or not, the principle of aggregation is used. The Member State assigns to each of the parameters (DIN, TN, DIP, TP, water transparency, chlorophyll average, total biomass of phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen, dissolved oxygen at the bottom) a score based on its value relative to the threshold value. Each of the scores are added up and averaged to give a score for each indicator (phytoplankton, physical-chemical water feature, macrobenthos). The indicators’ scores are then added and the average is used as a value for the assessment area. Finally, the entire marine area of Poland is assessed as being at GES or not based on how many areas are at GES. Poland’s preliminary assessment found that none of Polish areas are at GES.
Poland reports that there is a problem with the frequency and the coverage of sampling. However, there are no plans provided to address the gaps.";The initial assessment of Poland for eutrophication is considered adequate. Poland has reported nutrient loads, measurements of relevant parameters (e.g. nutrient concentrations) using the HELCOM CORE indicators and assessed the current state of the marine environment in relation to GES. The assessment covers both the water column and benthic habitats. Benthic habitats are assessed using the Multimetric indicator for macrozoobenthos.;"- Nutrient loads and concentrations reported on
- Good use of HELCOM CORE indicators
- Includes assessments of status for both individual water bodies and a status assessment of Polish waters in its entirety
- Both water column and benthic habitats addressed";3;Adequate
Poland;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Poland has defined a general target to address Descriptor 5, targets to address the Commission Decision criteria and targets to address most of the Commission Decision indicators. The general target is to have no significant effects of eutrophication caused by human activities. It is uncertain what the status of the first sentence, above the general target, is (starting with “Eutrophication caused by human activity is minimized…”) as it is not a reproduction of the GES definition.
This general D5 target is then expanded a bit by the targets linked to each Commission Decision criterion and finally specified for indicators 5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2. This selection of indicators does not entirely match those included in the Article 9 reporting. The targets, as a set, are all state targets for which HELCOM CORESET thresholds are reported in a separate table for each of the different Polish maritime areas. It is not always clear that the thresholds do not match those reported for GES.
All indicator-based targets are provided with thresholds, except for indicator 5.2.5 addressing opportunistic macroalgae. Furthermore, a target for macrozoobenthos is not defined for D5, however Poland clarified that they consider this element to be covered by its target for D6.
Poland has reported a timeline of 2020 for all geographical areas as the deadline for the achievement of the targets. Considering that the thresholds for targets and for GES are different, it calls into question the feasibility of also achieving GES by 2020.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Poland for D5 are assessed as partially adequate. The targets are all state targets that are accompanied by HELCOM CORESET thresholds except for the target dealing with opportunistic macroalgae for which no thresholds are provided. Additionally, the targets do not address macrozoobenthos in the context of D5, although Poland clarified that they are assessed for D6, which means that the targets do not address all elements reported under Art. 9 GES.;"- Targets are all state targets
- Targets have HELCOM CORESET thresholds except for target for opportunistic macroalgae
- Targets do not address macrozoobenthos so not all GES elements are addressed";2;Partially adequate
Poland;D5;Consistency ;;The multimetric macrozoobenthos indicator is used to define GES and for the initial assessment, but is not referred to in the targets for D5. Poland has clarified that this appears in D1 and D6.;;;;
Poland;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has reproduced the Annex I MSFD definition and the criteria and indicators provided in Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. Poland has then defined separate indicators which address criterion 6.2 and indicators 6.2.1 and 6.2.2. Criteria 6.1 and indicators 6.1.1, 6.1.2, 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 are not addressed by Poland.

The two indicators reported and fully developed are also reported under Descriptor 1 but should also be appropriate for assessing achievement of GES for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.2.2. The two indicators are however only suitable for addressing habitat condition and not physical damage which is necessary to fully address Descriptor 6.

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
At habitat level Poland has addressed both benthic and pelagic habitats using indicators that are mostly meant for assessing eutrophication such as the biomass ratio of perennial species and water transparency. The zooplankton and the multimetric indicator of macrozoobenthos B are part of HELCOM’s core indicators for biodiversity but have a strong focus on assessing the effects of eutrophication. Poland has not made reference to the criteria of habitat extent and distribution and to the Habitats and Birds Directives. No thresholds are defined for the zooplankton indicator. The indicators defined for both benthic and pelagic habitats are not comprehensive and mostly suitable for monitoring the effects of eutrophication.";The Polish GES definition for descriptor 6 is considered inadequate. Poland has only addressed criterion 6.2 and indicators 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the Commission Decision. The indicators provided do not address criterion 6.1 physical damage.;"- Poland has addressed criterion 6.2 but not criterion 6.1
- Does not address Criterion 6.1 physical damage

From Descriptor 1 assessment:

- Makes good use of HELCOM CORE indicators
- Selected HELCOM indicators include all relevant species groups and both benthic and pelagic habitats
- Yet, coverage of benthic habitats and birds is very limited

Habitats
Poland has carried out an initial assessment of the habitats in the Baltic Sea. The assessment is mostly qualitative and covers only one seabed habitat type: littoral sediment. The information reported by Poland is more comprehensive and developed in the paper report than in the reporting sheets. The majority of the reporting in the paper report is concerned with descriptions of the methods used.
For the assessment of the status of the habitat type, Poland used the ratio of biomass perennial species to the total biomass of macrophyte (SM index). Poland uses the WFD threshold value of SM > 80 as GES threshold. Multi-sample points in each of the four marine areas were assessed. During the initial assessment carried out 2010-2011, the Puck bay area received the highest value with 70 and the Eastern waters of the Gothland Basin received 53. None of Poland waters were assessed as being above the GES threshold for the SM index.
Poland also carried out an assessment of certain habitat types based on the multimeric macrozoobenthos index. This was carried out for littoral sediment and soft bottom (sandy, sandy-muddy and silty) habitats in all eight Polish areas. The assessment was done using the HELCOM HOLAS methods and the threshold value for B =3.18 was used as GES threshold. The coastal water of the Gulf of Gdansk received the highest value 3.04 while the polish part of Vistula lagoon received the lowest values 1.75. Thus, none of the areas were assessed as being at or above the threshold for GES.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Poland;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"As with Descriptors 1 and 4, Poland has used the Commission Decision to define the targets addressing Descriptor 6. Poland has defined a general target and a target for criterion 6.1 but no targets for the Commission Decision indicators. It has also not defined specific threshold values for the reported targets. The targets do not address criterion 6.2 for which two GES indicators are reported under Article 9.
The general target states that there should be no observed adverse impact of human activity on ecosystems in particular the seafloor; this target is not realistic as it does not take into account the sustainable use of the marine ecosystem. The target for criterion 6.1 states that the pressure of human activities should be decreased to ensure that most of the ecosystem component are within their historical value. This target does not refer to a historical baseline or clarify what would be considered “most” habitats.";The targets for descriptor 6 are considered inadequate. The targets are general and do not take into account the sustainable use of the sea. Neither target includes baselines or thresholds and are not SMART. Lastly the targets do not address the GES indicators 6.2.1 and 6.2.2.;"- Targets are general and do not take into account the sustainable use of the sea

Poland;D6;Consistency ;;Both the reporting for GES (Art. 9) and the targets (Art. 10) is structured using the Commission Decision 2010/477/EU, nonetheless there are some significant discrepancies between the approaches for defining GES and setting the targets. In the case of Descriptor 6 there is no consistency between the approach taken for defining GES and setting the targets.;;;;
Poland;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has defined GES for D7 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. Poland has reproduced Descriptor 7 as found in Annex I of the MSFD and the Commission Decision 2010/477/EU criteria and indicators. In the case of indicator 7.1.1, Poland has defined quantitative threshold values for the total area affected by permanent changes for transitional, coastal and open sea waters. The additional text provided for criterion 7.1 in the reporting sheets seems to provide a more specific description of what elements Poland will use to make its assessment of GES (e.g. constructions along the coast). In the paper report, it is unclear how the thresholds have been determined. In this regard, Poland clarified that the methodology followed for the establishment of the thresholds is explained in a ‘background report’, which was not submitted together with the main report, not being thus possible to provide an assessment on it. In the reporting sheets, Poland reports that the limit values are based on literature and expert judgment.
In the case of indicator 7.2.1 Poland refers to the thresholds reported for Indicator 6.1.2 as part of the Descriptor 6 GES definition. However, indicator 6.1.2 in the GES definition of Descriptor 6 is reported by Poland as not yet developed. Thus, it is considered that Poland has not defined thresholds yet for indicator 7.2.1. In addition, Poland reports that indicator 7.2.2 is ‘not included in the classification of marine waters’. Thus, impacts of hydrographical changes on sensitive habitats is not addressed in the Polish GES definition for D7.
Lastly, Poland does not make any mention of the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters or refer to existing regulatory regimes such as the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85/337/EEC).";The GES definition of Poland for D7 is assessed as inadequate. Poland has reproduced the Annex I GES definition and Commission Decision Criteria and indicators. Thresholds are reported for indicator 7.1.1 and, despite Poland refers to a background document explaining their determination, this was not submitted and thus is not possible to be assessed. In the case of indicator 7.2.1 Poland states that thresholds will be the same as those for indicator 6.1.2 but Poland has reported that this indicator is not yet developed. The GES definition does not refer to the WFD normative definitions for coastal waters or other relevant Directives such as the Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (EIA Directive).;"- GES definition reproduces Annex I GES definition and Commission Decision Criteria and indicators
- Thresholds are reported for indicator 7.1.1 but it is not clear how these were chosen
- The GES definition does not refer to WFD normative definitions or other relevant directives";1;Inadequate
Poland;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Poland has carried out a very limited assessment on the level of pressure of and impacts from permanent hydrographical changes. Limited information is reported in the reporting sheet, while more was reported in the paper report. The reason for this is that there is a lack of data on hydrological processes and indicators. As a result, the assessment is mainly based on the indicator permanent changes.
Poland uses the indicator ‘coverage of area affected by permanent change’ and the following thresholds: for transitional waters < 15%; for coastal waters < 20%; and for open sea water < 30%. On the basis of this, Poland has assessed that areas Eastern Baltic Proper offshore waters, Gulf of Gdansk Offshore waters, Gulf of Gdansk Polish Coastal waters, Szczecin Lagoon and Eastern Baltic Proper Polish Coastal waters are at GES. Only one assessment area (Vistula Lagoon) was assessed as not being at GES. The main causes of the pressure are reported to be offshore structures and solid waste disposal.
The Member State does not identify any gaps or any plans to address them.";The initial assessment of Poland for permanent hydrographical changes is considered partially adequate. The assessment is very limited and focused only on the amount of area affected by permanent change, impacts are not addressed. Poland has provided status judgements and found all selected areas except one at GES. The initial assessment does not make any explicit references to the WFD reports or to HELCOM HOLAS.;"- The assessment is very limited and only focused on the amount of area affected by permanent change
- Impacts of hydrographical changes are not addressed
- Poland has provided status judgements and found all areas except one at GES
- No explicit reference made to WFD reports or HELCOM HOLAS";2;Partially adequate
Poland;D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Poland has reported a general target for Descriptor 7, targets linked to its GES indicators and targets for protected areas. The status of the first sentence, before the general target, is unclear.
The general target requires limiting actions that can adversely affect hydrological conditions and marine ecosystems. These limits can be seen as addressed by the thresholds for indicator 7.1.1. The thresholds are less than 20% of coastal waters affected by permanent alterations and 30% of open waters; these match those set for Art. 9 but do not include the threshold for transitional waters (15%).
Poland has also defined thresholds for the amount of change in protected areas but does not specify whether this refers to the extent of area or extent of the habitats affected by permanent alterations. These thresholds also seem arbitrary and it is important to take into account not the just the amount impacted but also the importance of the area impacted. The protected areas covered by the targets are specified in the paper report.
The remaining targets addressing indicators 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 as well as the ‘geographic areas’ are very general and do not contain measurable thresholds (e.g. limiting permanent change). The targets do not refer to the WFD or other relevant Directives. However, Poland clarified that these targets were developed following exclusively MSFD methodology and this is why there is no reference to other Directives. The Member State commits to include WFD considerations into D7 assessment for the second cycle of the MSFD implementation.
Poland reports that the timeline for the achievement of the targets is 2020, similar to GES.";The set of environmental targets as defined by Poland for D7 is assessed as inadequate. The targets do not refer to the WFD or other relevant Directives and most targets are very general, however Poland commits to include these references as of the second MSFD implementation cycle. The target for indicator 7.1.1 has thresholds for the extent of area that can be affected by permanent changes but it is unclear how these thresholds have been motivated. In the case of protected areas, thresholds are also reported but it is unclear if these refer to the extent of area or spatial extent of habitats affected.;"- Targets do not refer to WFD or other relevant directives
- Most targets are very non-specific
- Target for indicator 7.1.1 contain thresholds but it is unclear how these thresholds have been motivated";1;Inadequate
Poland;D7;Consistency ;;The Polish approach for Descriptor 7 is consistent and the GES, targets and initial assessment report and use the same thresholds for the amount of area impacted by permanent alterations.                                                                             As stated above, Poland does not refer to the WFD definitions of ecological status classifications since it D7 followed MSFD-exclusive methodology when defining GES or the targets. Poland has clarified that it is committed to include references to the WFD for the second implementation cycle of the MSFD.;;;;
Poland;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has defined Descriptor 8 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. The definition at descriptor level is similar to the definition in Annex 1 of the Directive. The definitions at criteria and indicator levels are similar to those provided in the Commission Decision. The definitions in the paper report and in the reporting sheets are different.
Concentration of contaminants
Poland covers indicator 8.1.1 by listing a wide range of chemicals which cover many of the chemicals listed in Directive 2008/105/EC but not all (e.g. nickel and its compounds). The list also includes the radionuclide Cesium 137Cs which is considered a good practice.
In relation to GES threshold values, Poland has reported differently in its paper report and in the reporting sheets. In the paper report, Poland refers to what it calls the contamination coefficient (WS). This is defined in other parts of Poland’s reporting (e.g. in the Art 10 report) as the ratio of the current concentration of the pollutant in the selected matrix to the reference level of concentration in the same matrix. The threshold value defined by Poland in the paper report is that this indicator must be below 1. It is not entirely clear what the reference values are but considering the numerous references to HELCOM in other parts of the paper report (e.g. Art 8), it is assumed that the reference levels are the BAC defined in HELCOM.
In the reporting sheets however, the threshold values for GES are quantitative values for each contaminant in specific matrices (e.g. Fish: PBDE 4 ng g-1 ww). A direct reference is made to the EQS Directive, as well as to EAC/ERL and BAC which presumably are references to HELCOM thresholds. A threshold value is also given for Cs-137 and is specified to be pre-Chernobyl levels. However, considering the inconsistencies between the paper report and the reporting sheets, it is not clear which information is considered as the definitive GES definition for D8. As clarified by Poland, the reporting sheets provide an accurate definition of GES.                                                        Effects of contaminants
Poland has defined indicator 8.2.1 similarly to the indicator included in the Commission Decision. The Polish indicator is further defined through four indicators: lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), micronuclei assays, the reproductive success of eelpout and shellfish (amphipods) and fish diseases. Poland has not defined thresholds for any of these indicators and, except for eelpout, it is unclear which species will be sampled. Poland indicates that boundaries used to assess GES are temporarily not available, it is unclear when these will be provided.
Poland has also reported indicator 8.2.2 dealing with acute pollution effects but only addresses this indicator in terms of biological effects and not the occurrence, origin or extent of acute pollution events";The GES definition for D8 by Poland is considered partially adequate. Poland has largely reproduced the Descriptors, criteria and indicators as defined in the Commission Decision. Threshold values are set for various contaminants which come from the EQS Directive and HELCOM. Concerning the effects of contaminants Poland has reported four national basic indicators (e.g. LMS) but has not provided them with thresholds to determine whether GES is achieved. Indicator 8.2.2 is only addressed in terms of biological effects but not the occurrence, origin or extent of acute pollution events.;"- GES defined at criteria level and both criteria covered
- Threshold values set for various contaminants based on the EQS Directive and HELCOM         Four indicators for assessing the effects of synthetic and non-synthetic contaminants but these lack thresholds

Poland;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Poland provides a relatively detailed and quantitative report of contamination of the marine environment by hazardous substances. The assessment is carried out of each of the assessment areas with a varying amount of contaminants in each area. The selection of contaminants are those included in the list of priority hazardous substances Stockholm Convention and / or the Water Framework Directive and / or recommendations of HELCOM (including the Baltic Sea Action Plan BSAP) and the report of the Working Group. Poland monitors more contaminants in the coastal water bodies (20 in the Gulf of Gdansk) and less contaminants in the offshore areas (6 in the polish part of the Bornholm Basin).The information from the reporting sheet and the paper report combined provides an overview of the Polish assessment.
Poland provides a list of the synthetic substances assessed, including Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), Perfluorooctanoics PFO, 6- polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), furans, dioxins Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), additional forms of CB-28, CB-52, CB-101, CB-118, CB-138, CB-153 and CB-180 are described in the reporting sheets. For non-synthetic substances, Poland reports on mercury, cadmium, lead for heavy metals as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
For synthetic substances, Poland provides a detailed account of the threshold concentrations of certain pollutants (in particular PBDE, PCBs, PFOs) in fish, mussels and sediment in various marine areas of Poland. In the reporting sheets, Poland reports that 5-25% of the Polish part of the Bornholm Basin is affected by the pressure. No assessment is made for other areas. The waters in the Eastern part of the Gotland Basin were reported to experience improving trends in relation to contamination from synthetic contaminants. The main activity causing the pressure is reported as either urban or industrial waste waters. For non-synthetic contaminants, Poland mentions that industrial and urban sources are major contributors to the input of heavy metals in the marine waters. The pressure was reported to be affecting 1-5% of the Eastern part of the Bornholm Basin. No trends have been reported for non-synthetic compounds. Each of the heavy metal is monitored in three matrices (fish, mussel, sediment).
In terms of judgement, in the paper report, Poland uses a rating from 1 being the least favourable to 5 being the most favourable (1-3 GES is not achieved, while 4-5 GES is achieved) for each of the contaminants, while in the reporting sheets, it provides a threshold value and a judgment of ‘good’ or ‘not good’. Within the reporting sheets, for synthetic contaminants, offshore waters in the Gulf of Gdansk is the only area that receives a ‘not good’ judgment. With regard to the impact on functional groups, all areas have been assessed as being in ‘good’ status. For the non–synthetic compounds, not all areas have been assessed. Also in the reporting sheets, the Vistula Lagoon, Gulf of Gdansk, Bornholm, Basin Offshore waters, the Eastern Baltic Proper Offshore waters and Szczecin Lagoon receive a ‘not good’ status. The Eastern Baltic Proper and Bornholm Basin Offshore waters have also been judged to be at ‘not good’ status for the impacts on functional groups, while the Szczecin Lagoon, Vistula Lagoon and Bornholm Basin have all been assessed as in good status in relation to impacts.
In the paper report, contamination by dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs in sediment and mercury in fish in all marine areas has been assessed to be at 3 or lower, i.e. at ‘not good’ status, while contamination by the other substances in all matrices is assessed to be at 3 or higher, i.e. ‘good’ status. Thus, all areas are considered to be at GES in relation to contamination by non-synthetic compounds.
Radionuclides
Poland make an assessment of Cesium-137 in water. Poland reports that between 1-5% and 25-50% of a number of assessment areas have been assessed as affected by radionuclide contamination. It also reports that the trend of radionuclide contamination is decreasing because the main source of contaminants is the historical inputs from Chernobyl. All areas assessed are assessed as ‘not good’. In regard to the impacts on functional groups, only the areas of the Bornholm Basin Offshore waters and Eastern Baltic Proper offshore waters have been assessed, both of which were assessed as being at ‘not good’ status.
The Polish initial assessment does not include an assessment of acute pollution events. Poland reports that there are gaps especially with regards to criterion 8.1 because there is a lack of data";The assessment by Poland of contamination of its marine waters by hazardous substances and acute pollution events is considered partially adequate. Poland has addressed relevant contaminants listed under the WFD, HELCOM and the Stockholm Convention. Poland has also addressed the relevant assessment matrices including sediment and biota and judged status. The assessment however varies in level of coverage of contaminants for the different Polish waters. Also Poland has not assessed acute pollution events. Poland does assess radionuclides which is considered a good practice. Finally, Poland reports that there are gaps in regards to criterion 8.1 due to a lack of data.;"- Relevant contaminants listed under the WFD, HELCOM and Stockholm convention are addressed
- Assessment done within the relevant matrices including sediment and biota
- Assessment coverage varies significantly for the different contaminants and Polish waterbodies Assessment of status made
- No assessment of acute pollution events
- Radionuclides assessed which is a good practice (+++)";2;Partially adequate
Poland;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Poland has defined a general target and targets addressing each of the Commission Decision indicators. The main target is to reduce or maintain the concentrations of pollutants from various sources so that pollutants do not exceed hazardous levels. This main target should ensure that effects of contaminants on marine organisms is minimal and levels of contaminants are consistent with levels required by national and international law. Poland does not specify with which national and international laws it needs to comply with to achieve the target.
In relation to indicator 8.1.1, Poland’s target is to maintain contamination levels for a set of substances below reference levels. This is further specified through a list of substances and the matrices in which these should be assessed. As for the threshold value, in both the paper report and the reporting sheets, Poland uses the same indicator as for GES in the paper report, i.e. the contamination coefficient (WS).
There is no direct reference to the EQS Directive or to HELCOM in either format, but a general reference to ‘national and international’ agreements, which are assumed to cover European and RSC standards. Poland has clarified that reference to these are made in their targets,
For indicator 8.2.2 Poland states that effects of pollutants should be at levels that ensure the normal physiological functions and development of an organism. Since it is not specified to which organisms the indicator applies, it could be interpreted as being achieved even when only a few organisms do not suffer negative effects or conversely being achieved only when all organisms are at normal levels, which may be an unrealistic target. Poland mentions more specific biological effects, e.g. lysosomal membrane stability, as in the GES definition, but it states that specific thresholds for these have not yet been defined.
Finally, in relation to indicator 8.2.2, Poland states that pollution events should be minimized and their impacts should not significantly impact the proper functioning of marine organisms. It is unclear how this target will be assessed as it does not contain any SMART attributes, the second part regarding the proper functioning of marine organisms could potentially be assessed but Poland has not defined thresholds for the indicators dealing with this aspect (Indicator 8.2.1).";The set of targets defined by Poland to cover D8 is considered partially adequate. As clarified by Poland, the targets refer to relevant European legislation but where relevant are presumably assessed against the relevant international standards. The targets include coverage of radionuclides which is a good practice. In relation to the effects on organisms Poland states that the effects of pollutants should allow for the normal development of a marine organism, this could mean that if one organism is not impacted the target is achieved even though other organisms might actually be affected. Specific indicators for this target have not yet been defined so that might address this issue. Concerning acute pollution events Poland states that these should be reduced to a minimum, but this is a relative term so it is unclear how this target can actually be assessed.;"- Targets contain thresholds which are presumably assessed against the relevant international standards, that are explicitly mentioned in the GES definition
- Specific targets concerning the effects of pollutants are not developed
- Target concerning acute pollution events states that these should be minimised, this is not SMART";2;Partially adequate
Poland;D8;Consistency ;;The Polish approach is consistent across articles, although there are inconsistencies between the paper reports and the reporting sheets. Both the GES and targets are defined using the structure of Commission Decision 2010/477/EU. In terms of threshold values, the contamination coefficient/indicator (WS) is referred to in the GES and target definitions. However, it does not seem to be used in the initial assessment, which instead uses a 1-5 ranking system.;;;;
Poland;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Poland has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor and indicator level. At descriptor level, Poland reproduces the Annex I Descriptor 9 definition which states that contaminants in fish and other seafood for human consumption should not exceed levels established by European legislation.
At indicator level however Poland provides a limited list that only covers a few of the substances addressed by European foodstuff legislation. The list of contaminants is the same in the paper report and reporting sheets. There is no specification about which fish species should be used for the sampling in either reporting format.
As for D8, Poland has an inconsistent approach to the threshold values between the paper report and the reporting sheets. In the paper report, Poland uses the same indicator as for D8, i.e. the contamination coefficient (WS) while in the reporting sheets, it provides actual quantitative threshold values (e.g. PBDE 11), defined as limit reference points. It directly refers to Commission Regulation 1881/2006 in the reporting sheets as well as to the European Food Safety Agency. As with D8, it is not clear which threshold values (i.e. those in the paper report or those in the reporting sheets) should be considered as the definitive GES values. Poland has clarified that the reporting sheet values are applicable.";"The definition of GES for D9 by Poland is considered to be partially adequate. At Descriptor level Poland reproduces the Annex I definition for Descriptor 9 which refers to contaminant levels not exceeding European standards. However, the list of substances provided to assess achievement of the indicators is very brief and does not address all substances addressed by European foodstuff regulation; therefore coverage might not be complete.";"- Poland reproduces Annex I definition for Descriptor 9 which states that contaminant levels should not exceed European standards

Poland;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Hazardous substances
Poland provides information in both reporting sheets and paper report on the contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances. The information in the paper report provides a useful insight into the methods used for the assessment. Poland reports on PBDE, HBCDD, dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs, tributyltin compounds mercury, cadmium and lead in fish. The number of contaminants assessed varies across the areas, which according to Poland is due on data availability, i.e. three substances are monitored in the Gulf of Gdansk Offshore waters and eight in the Gulf of Gdansk. The list is informed from work on the HELCOM CORESET project.
,
Poland uses a similar system to make a judgment on the level of contamination in seafood as used for D8. For synthetic substances, all areas of polish water are assessed as being in good status, while for non-synthetic substances, five areas are assessed as being in the good status and one, the Bornholm Basin Offshore waters, is considered to be in ‘not good’ status. In the paper report, all water bodies are considered to be at GES.
The polish initial assessment does not include an assessment of microbial pathogens. Finally Poland reports that there are gaps especially with regards to criterion 9.1 because there is a lack of data.";The assessment of the contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption by Poland is considered partially adequate. Poland has reported on relevant contaminants based on the work of HELCOM CORESET and provided judgements of status. Nonetheless coverage of contaminants is not complete and there is an inconsistency between the judgements in the paper report and reporting sheets. Poland has not made an assessment of microbial pathogens.;"- Poland has reported on relevant contaminants based on the work of HELCOM CORESET

Poland;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Poland has defined a general target and targets addressing each indicator. Poland does not clarify which national or international regulations would be considered when assessing achievement of the targets but it is assumed to cover EU regulation 1881/2006.
In relation to indicators 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 Poland states that concentrations of contaminants in fish should be at levels consistent with current recommendations; it is unclear why no reference is made to other seafood as is done in the main target. Secondly in relation to the indicators Poland states that the number of substances for which concentrations exceed acceptable levels should be reduced. This target does not contain any SMART attributes so any reduction would be considered as achieving the target; this might not be sufficiently ambitious to achieve GES. Finally, Poland lists specific substances to be monitored but these do not cover all contaminants listed in regulation 1881/2006 (e.g. Benzo(a)pyrene).";"The set of target and indicators defined by Poland to cover D9 is considered partially adequate. None of the targets refer explicitly to regulation 1881/2006 or other national and international legislation although these will presumably be used to assess achievement of the targets. Lastly the target for indicator 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 states that the number of contaminants for which standards are exceeded should be reduced but the level of desired change is not reported; it is therefore unclear whether this is sufficient to achieve GES.";"- The targets state that contaminant levels should be below reference values which presumably refer to the relevant international standards, that are explicitly mentioned in the GES definition
- Poland states that occurrences of contaminants exceeding reference values should be reduced but the level of desired change is not indicated which might not be sufficient to achieve GES";2;Partially adequate
Poland;D9;Consistency ;;The Polish reporting for D9 is only partially consistent. Poland does not make directly reference to relevant European foodstuff regulations and lacks clarity regarding which thresholds will be used to assess achievement of GES or the targets. In the reporting Poland does not consistently refer to the same contaminants when reporting on Article 8, 9 and 10.;;;;
Portugal;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Portugal has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at the level of the descriptor. The Portuguese GES definition consists of two parts: a verbatim copy of the descriptor as provided in Annex I of the MSFD followed by the CBD definition of biological diversity. The criteria and indicators of the Commission Decisions have not been applied to the Portuguese GES definition. Portugal however does refer to the three relevant levels of assessment for biodiversity: habitats, species and ecosystem. 

The definition of GES does not include specific habitats or species. Considering the strong links between the GES definition and the initial assessment, it could be inferred that the GES definition covers at least the habitats and species assessed for the current assessment exercise. This however is not confirmed by the definition itself, which is so general that it could be considered to cover all biodiversity components. 

No baseline is defined to specify the term “maintain”. Mention is made, as in the definition of D1 in the Directive, to geographic, climate and physiographic conditions but there is a lack of specification of these “reference” conditions (e.g. natural, prevailing). 

The definition of GES does not reflect the definitions for Favourable Conservation Status under the Habitats Directive and for Good Ecological Status under the Water Framework Directive. No reference is made to protected species. ";The definition of GES for D1 is considered inadequate. The Portuguese definition is a reformulation of the descriptor as provided in Annex I of the MSFD with one important omission (prevailing). The formulation of GES is not specific and does not define the conditions which result in the achievement of GES. The inclusion of the CBD definition of biodiversity does not resolve this issue. ;"- Reformulation of MSFD Annex I with one important omission (reference to prevailing conditions)

Portugal;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Portugal has reported using the functional group classification. More specifically, it has reported on coastal fish, pelagic fish, pelagic elasmobranchs, coastal cephalopods, demersal fish, demersal elasmobranchs, deep sea fish, deep sea elasmobranchs, deep sea cephalopods and sea birds. Mammals were excluded due to the lack of sufficient information and reptiles were not considered relevant since they are of a markedly seasonal nature. 

For each group, apart from birds, the analysis – qualitative and quantitative – focuses on the habitats, the condition and the abundance of the group. A list of surrogate species has been given for certain species groups/functional groups, but again not for birds. No justification is given as to why these are excluded. The assessment area is always provided. The main pressures have been identified but only in relation to the species with commercial value which have been reported under Descriptor 3. 

Trends (either increasing or stable) have been provided on the status of coastal fish, demersal fish, demersal elasmobranchs, deep-sea fish and deep-sea elasmobranchs, although with a low confidence level for these last two. A judgement in reference to GES has been made in relation to all groups except cephalopods, pelagic fish and pelagic elasmobranchs. In all cases it is considered that GES is currently achieved, even if with a low confidence level in a couple of cases.

As for habitats, Portugal indicates that species covered under the Habitats and Birds Directive will be reported according to the timescale and format agreed under those Directives. Reference is made to various international agreements for the protection of species throughout the assessment (e.g. CITES, Bonn Convention and Bern Convention). The individual species requiring special protection under these agreements are listed in one of the annexes to the report.

Habitats
Portugal has reported on a number of seabed habitat types (coastal sediment, shelf sediment, bathyal sediment, coastal rock, shelf rock, bathyal rock, water column: coastal, water column: shelf and water column: oceanic), following the EUNIS level 2 categories rather than the pre-defined list of predominant habitat types. However, the Portuguese classification can be considered equivalent to the MSFD classification. No fine-level habitats have been reported. 

Where appropriate, the assessment of habitat types addresses both the abiotic (physical, hydrological, chemical) and biotic (community) aspects of each habitat. For each habitat, the habitat distribution, extent and condition have been reported. For those habitats mentioned the report describes the assessment area, status and confidence level. A qualitative judgement on status or the trend of the status has been made but not a quantitative assessment, even if there is an attempt to quantify some parameters. The main pressures on each habitat have not been identified.

For the water column, the assessment is made in a general fashion based on plankton communities. In relation to phytoplankton, the taxonomic groups which were considered most relevant for the assessment are listed and the indicator 1.6.2 of the Commission Decision was used; for zooplankton, both indicator 1.6.1 and 1.6.2 were used. For the seabed, the assessment of both micro and macrofauna used indicator 1.6.1 of the Commission Decision. The species more representative of each type of seabed habitat are also listed.

Portugal indicates that the habitats listed in the Habitats Directive will be reported according to the timescale and format agreed under that Directive and lists the seven relevant habitats for the sub-division of the Continent. The report refers to OSPAR and to the Convention on Biological Diversity but just in general terms, and not specifically in relation to the habitats requiring special protection under these agreements. It does however refer to three specific areas as “special habitats” – the Reserva Natural das Ilhas Berlengas (a natural reserve consisting on a group of island locate 5.7 miles of the coast), the Parque Marinho Professor Luiz Saldanha (a natural park which is part of Natura 2000) and the Gorringe Bank (a underwater mountain located in southwest area of the sub-division).

Ecosystems
No assessment has been made of ecosystems. ";The initial assessment by Portugal of biological features is considered adequate. The major habitat types and species groups are covered, although there is not enough information on the relevant pressures and the assessment of species has focused mostly on fish species. The information reported is mostly qualitative but quantitative information on some parameters is provided. Reference is made to existing international conservation agreements and to the Habitats Directive.;"Features:
- Covers major habitat types and functional groups
- Mainly qualitative information but several parameters are quantified
- Judgement on current status per reference to GES
- List of the individual species requiring special protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives and the relevant international agreements";3;Adequate
Portugal;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"It is considered that Portugal has not defined specific environmental targets for the biodiversity descriptors. One specific target is said to address D1 (more specifically indicator 1.1.2 distributional pattern) on the recovery of the biomass levels of the stock of Sardina pilchardus. This target however is more specific to D3 and therefore has been assessed in the section 5 of this report.  

Apart from this, no other specific target has been reported to address biodiversity. Portugal has in any case reported one generic target on monitoring which is applicable to the biodiversity descriptors and is analyzed in the cross-cutting section. 

In addition, Portugal has indicated that, in relation to D1 and D4, the objectives of the following existing requirements/ standards/ agreements must be taken into account:  Commission Communication COM (2008) 791 final “Roadmap for Maritime Spatial Planning: Achieving Common Principles in the EU”, Regulation 812/2004 establishing measures to limit by-catches of cetaceans, the CBD and the establishment of the global network of MPAs by 2012, the full implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy. A number of regulations and agreements more related to D3 are also linked to D1 and D4, these are listed in Section 5 on D3.";Not reported.;"- Not reported
";0;Not reported
Portugal;D1;Consistency ;;"In general, the assessment of biological features is consistent with the definitions for D1, D4 and D6 since these definitions are generic and high-level. 

In the assessment of the physical loss and damage pressures, Portugal reports extensively on the substrates that are impacted by marine activities. However biogenic substrates are not referred to (not even in a general way) in the GES definition for Descriptor 6 on seafloor integrity. Portugal also makes a judgement on the current condition of the benthic community as per criterion 6.2 of the Commission Decision in its initial assessment while criterion 6.2 is not at all covered in the GES definition for D6. 

The consistency between the targets and the initial assessment and between the targets and the GES definition cannot be assessed since no specific target has been defined for biodiversity. ";;;;
Portugal;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Portugal has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor level only. It does not integrate the criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision. The GES definition is cited to a large extent from the definition in the Directive. 

There is a lack of specification of the terms used in the definition, in particular “risk for the coastal and marine environment”. In the introductory text, Portugal refers to the OSPAR approach (but not specifically mentioning the OSPAR EcoQO), to UNEP/MAP and ICES as part of the methodological framework to assess GES. No threshold value or baseline is proposed. In the assessment of current status, Portugal proposes a baseline of 2014 for the assessment of indicators 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 but the link with this definition of GES is not made. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 10 is considered as inadequate. Insufficient detail is provided in order to assess if and when GES is achieved. ;"- GES defined at descriptor level only and does not integrate Commission Decision criteria/indicators

Portugal;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Portugal reports data for marine litter on the beach, seabed and micro-particles (criterion 10.1). For beach litter, the top 10 of most commonly found items are reported. The average number of macro litter per kilometre was of 26 items. Between 2006 and 2011, based on crustaceans and demersal winter surveys, litter is observed in 49% of the sampling stations.  Data on micro-plastics on the beach is being collected by a research institute in 2008 and 2009. The study found that 72% of the number of plastics collected on the beach were micro-plastic (between 1-5 mm) with only 10% larger than 1 cm. The study also revealed that all plastic pellets had absorbed contaminants, including hydrocarbons, PCBs and pesticides.  

Insufficient data was available to demonstrate the impact of marine litter on biota (criterion 10.2). Portugal acknowledges the data gaps and provides a number of general recommendations to address these as well as other gaps identified in the initial assessment. 

The methodology used for the assessment follows the criteria of the Commission Decision and a number of international/regional guidelines. In particular, reference is made to OSPAR QSR and to a 2000-2006 OSPAR-led project (which recorded litter on the beach) as well as to the 2009 UNEP document “Guidelines on survey and monitoring of marine litter”. The IA also refers to a 2011 JRC document, presumably the Task Group report on D10 although this dates back to 2010.  Finally, Portugal refers to its draft National Plan for Waste Management, which has a strategic goal to reduce waste by 20% (by weight in comparison to 2009) by 2020 and increase waste recovery by 28% (by weight in comparison to 2009) through reuse and recycling. 

Portugal has not made a final judgement on the current state of its marine waters with regard to pollution by marine litter in relation to GES. However, in a summary table of the indicators used to assess status (the Commission Decision indicators), Portugal specifies that the baseline to be used to assess status in relation to GES is 2014 for indicator 10.1.1 and 10.1.2, which Portugal explains will be when harmonized protocols will be finalised whose quality is comparable and controlled with a known level of uncertainty.";The initial assessment carried out by Portugal on marine litter considered adequate. Enough information (qualitative and quantitative) is provided considering the current state of knowledge. Limited data on impacts on ecosystem components is provided but this is in line with current state of knowledge. Many references to OSPAR, UNEP, JRC.

Portugal;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Portugal reports four targets to cover Descriptor 10. Targets 1 and 2 are pressure-reduction targets. While target 1 aims to reduce the level of beach litter, target 2 addresses sea-bed litter. As baseline, the year 2014 is proposed. Targets 3 and 4 aim respectively to improve the understanding of micro-particles and the impact of marine litter on biota. 

The targets are not measurable (with the exception of target 1) and would benefit from further specification. Associated indicators, further specifying the targets, have not been proposed. In addition to the targets for the MSFD, Portugal also refers to the obligations of the MARPOL Convention and the Directive on Port Reception Facilities (2000/59/EC). The sources of marine litter are not addressed by the targets.";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators covering D10 is considered inadequate.

A lack of data is also reported for the impact of marine litter on biota. 

Targets have been identified for the indicators and criteria of the Commission Decision. Yet, the targets need to be further specified in order to become measurable.

Finally, it is unclear how and whether the proposed targets aim to achieve the GES definition at descriptor level. The sources of marine litter are not addressed by the targets.";;;;

Portugal;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Portugal made an assessment of the NIS in the continental division. It refers in particular to the recommendations of the working group JRC/ICES on Descriptor 2 and OSPAR advice on biodiversity but considers that the applicability of the Bio-Pollution Index developed by HELCOM needs further evaluation. The assessment area is the continental shelf including coastal waters.

Portugal listed 38 NIS in its paper report. The ratio between invasive and native species has been assessed for each of the taxonomic group reported upon. Portugal made an assessment of the level of the pressure on the environment looking at abundance, temporal occurrence and spatial distribution. However, the level of the pressure is not quantified. Portugal notes that information on abundance is scarce. Abundance is reported on five species (Gymnodinium catenatum, Ostreopsis ovata, Ampelisca heterodactyla, Ocenebra inornata, Corella eumyota). 

The main pathways and vectors identified are shipping and aquaculture. However, Portugal indicates that the available information is very limited making it impossible to establish a direct link between the activities and the presence of NIS.

In terms of impacts, Portugal states that currently there is no evidence of negative changes attributable to NIS at the level of species, communities, habitats or ecosystems with the exception of G. catenatum blooms) although the impacts of invasive NIS at the level of species, habitats and ecosystems is unknown. There is no specific plan to address this gap in knowledge, other than the general target on monitoring (see Section1).

Portugal has made a judgement on the level of the pressure. It considers that GES is achieved based on the limited size of the assessment area occupied and the small number of NIS. The level of confidence in relation to this judgement is low. Given that Portugal itself recognises that the impact of invasive NIS at the level of species, habitats and ecosystems is unknown, it does not seem that this judgement is sufficiently grounded. ";The assessment is considered to be adequate. It appears relatively complete in the light of what can be expected for Descriptor 2. Portugal has provided information on NIS present in its marine waters, including abundance, temporal occurrence, spatial distribution and the ratios between indigenous and non-indigenous species when available.

However, there is no target relating to maintaining GES and no detailed plans to close knowledge and data gaps.;;;;
Portugal;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Portuguese GES definition has been defined at the descriptor level but contains certain specific deviations from the Descriptor as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. 

In the text of Annex I the descriptor states “all populations of all commercial stocks are within safe biological limits” while the Portuguese GES states that fisheries pressure should not lead to the deterioration of populations of targeted species. The Portuguese GES however does not specify the point from which no deterioration of stocks should occur nor the proportion of stocks for which the populations should not deteriorate in order to achieve GES. 

The second part of the GES states that the reproductive capacity and age distributions are at levels that guarantee the sustainable exploitation of the resource which could be understood to mean that stocks are within safe biological limits. However it is not clear if “the resource” applies to all stocks. This second part also deviates from the Annex I text which states that age and size distributions should be at levels indicative of healthy stocks. Since no guidance has been provided by the Commission for this part of the Annex I text, as understood to be criteria 3.3, it cannot be concluded whether the Portuguese formulation is comparable to the Annex I formulation";The Portuguese GES definition is inadequate since it does not require F to be at Fmsy. The formulation is also insufficiently clear on whether all commercial stocks should have a SSB at or above SSBpa in order to achieve GES. ;"- Does not require all stocks to be exploited at or below Fmsy

Portugal;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Portuguese initial assessment is highly detailed and discusses stock developments, TACS and Portuguese quotas from previous years, threshold values and trends for stocks biomasses, catches, fishing mortality levels and the proportion of adults in populations. The assessment however lacks information on fishing fleets and does not explain in detail fishery impacts.

The current status of all stocks has been assessed. Portugal makes a final judgement in relation to GES using the following methodology: Stocks for which primary indicators were available have been assessed in relation to Fmsy and SSBmsy or Btrig. Stocks for which Fmsy and SSBmsy reference points were not available have been assessed using the following formula: (Recent average – long term average)/ long term Standard deviation. The majority of stocks were assessed using the secondary indicators. 34 stocks have been assessed in total including elasmobranches, molluscs (including cephalopods) and crustaceans. 

The status of all the stocks assessed using secondary indicators is indicated as being at GES. The status of 4 out of the 9 stocks assessed using MSY reference points is indicated as not being at GES, for at least one of the criteria (3.1 or 3.2). These four stocks are Sardina pilcharus, Merluccius merluccius, Lophius piscatorius and Lipidorhombus bosccii.";The Portuguese assessment is partially adequate. The assessment is very comprehensive in its assessment of stocks including those from all the relevant functional groups. Each stock has been described in detail.

Portugal;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Portugal has reported five targets specifically for D3. These targets are to recover the biomass levels of two stocks and sustainably exploit three other stocks at Fmsy. 

The targets are specific and contain thresholds and timelines except for Target 1 on sardines. For Target 1, it is not clear to which level the sardines should be recovered (although it is likely to be to a precautionary approach (PA) level i.e. within safe biological limits).  For each stock with a specific target, a recovery plan is already in place, with the exception of Isurus oxyrinchius. The targets as a set however do not cover the majority of stocks as identified in the initial assessment. 

In addition, Portugal has in reported one generic target on monitoring which is applicable to D3 and is analyzed in the cross-cutting section. Portugal has indicated that, in relation to D3, its targets must be compatible with the objectives of the Commission Communication on Maritime Spatial Planning, the CFP Regulation, Regulation 850/98 on the protection of juveniles of marine organisms, Regulation 2166/2005 on the recovery of the Southern hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and Western Iberian peninsula, Regulation 2347/2002 on fishing for deep-sea stocks, the TACs and quotas annual regulations, the OSPAR Convention, the recommendations of the ICCAT Commission on tuna, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission for multilateral cooperation, the Nagoya Protocol and national legislation on conservation measures for fish and wildlife resources.";The set of environmental targets defined by Portugal to cover D3 is considered inadequate.

Portugal;D3;Consistency ;;"The Portuguese GES definition and the environmental targets are poorly developed while the initial assessment is very comprehensive. The methodology applied to do the initial assessment indicates that GES requires stocks to be exploited at Fmsy and have a SSB equal to or higher than SSBmsy but this should be explicitly stated in the GES definition. 

As for the targets they seem to be based on the initial assessment in that stocks which were assessed to not be at GES have to be addressed by either adjusting the exploitation rate or restoring the stock biomass. In general however it is clear that the Portuguese assessment has focused primarily on the initial assessment. Regarding the methodology applied by Portugal to determine whether a stock is at GES, there might be a need to discuss whether the secondary indicator method used is adequate. ";;;;
Portugal;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Portugal has defined GES for Descriptor 4 at the level of the descriptor. The definition refers to “indicators” which are not further defined. It is not clear whether these indicators are the same as those of the Commission Decision.  If they are different, it means that the GES definition is not defined at the criteria and indicator levels as per the Commission Decision. 

The definition specifies that the “moving average” of these indicators has been constant or indicating a growing trend over the past 5 years. If the indicators referred to are those of the Commission Decision, this might not be appropriate for all indicators. For example it might not be desirable to have a growing trend for groups with fast turnover rates (e.g. jellyfish, short-living pelagic fish). 

Considering the strong links between the initial assessment and the definition of GES, it is likely that these indicators have been specified during the initial assessment. However, they are not integrated in the Portuguese definition of GES.";The definition of GES for D4 is considered inadequate since it is not clear which indicators will be considered for GES and the condition set for the achievement of GES using the indicators might not be appropriate for each separate indicator. ;"- GES definition only at descriptor level

Portugal;D4;Consistency ;;"In general, the assessment of biological features is consistent with the definitions for D1, D4 and D6 since these definitions are generic and high-level. 

In the assessment of the physical loss and damage pressures, Portugal reports extensively on the substrates that are impacted by marine activities. However biogenic substrates are not referred to (not even in a general way) in the GES definition for Descriptor 6 on seafloor integrity. Portugal also makes a judgement on the current condition of the benthic community as per criterion 6.2 of the Commission Decision in its initial assessment while criterion 6.2 is not at all covered in the GES definition for D6. 

The consistency between the targets and the initial assessment and between the targets and the GES definition cannot be assessed since no specific target has been defined for biodiversity. ";;;;
Portugal;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Portugal has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor level only. No reference is made to the inclusion of criteria-level thresholds, and the definition could be interpreted as requiring no assessment of changes in water transparency or macrophytobenthos populations. It does, however, consider some direct and indirect effects, even if it does not refer to the causes of eutrophication and related pressures. 

No threshold values or reference conditions are given. In the accompanying text, gaps in knowledge are identified and while no plans are provided to address these gaps, the targets defined by Portugal actually play this role. Some of this missing information however could have been collated for WFD assessment purposes. No attempt is made to match MSFD GES definition for D5 to WFD normative definitions, and no justification is provided for not doing so.";The GES definition of Portugal for D5 is assessed as inadequate. The definition is very close to the MSFD definition but no criteria or indicators are provided.  The data/information requirements and knowledge gaps are insufficiently explained, as are the planned means and methods of filling these gaps.

Portugal;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"An initial assessment on eutrophication – qualitative and quantitative – has been undertaken by Portugal for the Continental sub-division of the North East Atlantic marine region. Pressures are reported (loads of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter), but no breakdown of the loads into individual sources is given. Nutrient (at least nitrogen) loads via atmospheric deposition to offshore waters are not provided. There is no reference to reduced oxygen status or a decrease in transparency of the waters, but the cited paper contains data which are at least 10 years old. However, maps of nitrogen, chlorophyll and organic matter are provided. 

An attempt has been made to cover the full geographic area by dividing the territorial waters into six assessment areas and an estimate of the degree of confidence associated with the loads is provided, based on the amount and sources of data used to estimate the loads. An assessment of impacts on the water column, but not the sea bed, has been provided, showing all six areas to be at GES, but no trend analysis has been undertaken. Threshold levels given are identical to those reported for the six areas, so it appears that the MS has opted for a ‘no degradation’ approach, based on an assumption that GES is currently being achieved, but without a full assessment of eutrophication impacts.

All relevant nutrients and organic loading are considered in terms of loads, but only nutrients in terms of impacts. No mention is given to changes in turbidity, changes in floristic composition or macrophytobenthos impacts, but presumably WFD assessment data exists (for coastal water bodies) for both phytobenthos and possibly phytoplankton (community composition as well as chlorophyll), which may need some disaggregation for MSFD purposes.

Portugal;D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of eutrophication and its impacts is not consistent with the Portuguese definition of GES for D5. The major issue appears to lie with the inadequate definition of GES. Impacts on macrophytobenthos or on shifts in floristic composition would not have been covered. Total pressures have been estimated together with a useful assessment of the confidence associated with those quantifications, but no trend analysis has been undertaken and in order to develop cost-effect management scenarios/plans, individual sources of nutrients/organic load and vectors of entry to the marine environment need to be established.

The generic target on monitoring is not sufficient to achieve GES for Descriptor 5 but should in any case enable improved quantification of pressures and impacts in the future, enabling cost-effective management plans and further targets to be developed at a later date.";;;;
Portugal;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Portugal has defined GES for Descriptor 6 at the descriptor level. The Portuguese definition specifies further the definition as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. It can be considered that the definition incorporates criterion 6.1 on physical damage. However, it does not specifically refer to the ecosystem components impacted (biogenic substrates, benthic community) but refers globally to ecosystems (structure and functioning) and ecological processes (diversity, productivity and dynamism). In particular, the definition is not at all focused on seafloor integrity and seafloor ecosystems. 

It is rather defined from the perspective of the pressures causing the impact on the ecosystem (but not specifically the seafloor ecosystem) and introduces a notion of sustainability of the marine uses. Based on the GES definition it is clear that impacts will have to be assessed at the ecosystem scale. 

No baseline is defined which would further specify the term “maintained” in the first sentence and “maintenance” in the second sentence. It is also not clear what is meant with “significant adverse impacts” or “balanced” pressures. “Sufficiently small” negative impacts are specified only to the extent that they allow recovery but it is not clarified to which state they should recover (i.e. the state just before the impact occurred? That might still be a degraded state in comparison to prevailing conditions). ";The definition of GES for D6 is considered inadequate. The GES definition lacks specificity with regard to a number of terms which means that it is not possible to know when GES is achieved. The definition does not refer to specific seafloor ecosystem components impacted and is not at all specific to seafloor integrity.;"- GES defined only at descriptor level but not a reproduction of the MSFD Annex I definition

Portugal;D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Adequate; 3):

Portugal has made a comprehensive assessment of the relevant types and causes of physical loss and physical damage in its marine waters. Portugal acknowledges that knowledge of the full spatial distribution and intensity of physical loss and physical damage is not homogeneous and therefore the assessment areas vary depending on the specific indicators and the information available. 

The main causes of physical loss include dredging associated with sand extraction, marinas and ports, placement of reef structures, as well as cables and pipelines; while trawl fishing has been indicated as the main cause of physical damage. Portugal also listed the types of subtract impacted relating them to specific pressures (construction of artificial reefs and trawl fishing), providing qualitative and quantitative information. Each type of pressure is addressed separately and the information, particularly in relation to trawl fishing, is quite comprehensive.

Specifically in relation to physical damage caused by trawling, the current situation is quite negative as Portugal indicates that 46% of the analysed subtracts were subject to trawl fishing in more than 75 % of the areas of occurrence. Portugal has also reported a list of structures with direct influence on the coastal zone and involving a loss of physical substrate in their area of implementation; although no quantification of the area affected is provided, it is indicated that it is rather small when compared with the total area assessed. However, it is indicated that existing biodiversity studies do not show significant negative impacts resulting from trawl fishing.

Portugal acknowledges that it has not made a conclusive judgement level of, and impacts from, physical loss and physical damage due to insufficient knowledge. The judgement provided by Portugal in the paper report is limited to the indicator 6.2.2 on benthic community condition and functionality, such as species diversity and richness, proportion of opportunistic to sensitive species – in all the areas assessed it was considered that GES is currently achieved, even if in some cases with a low level of confidence.

Biological features (Adequate, 3):

Habitats
Portugal has reported on a number of seabed habitat types (coastal sediment, shelf sediment, bathyal sediment, coastal rock, shelf rock, bathyal rock, water column: coastal, water column: shelf and water column: oceanic), following the EUNIS level 2 categories rather than the pre-defined list of predominant habitat types. However, the Portuguese classification can be considered equivalent to the MSFD classification. No fine-level habitats have been reported. 

Where appropriate, the assessment of habitat types addresses both the abiotic (physical, hydrological, chemical) and biotic (community) aspects of each habitat. For each habitat, the habitat distribution, extent and condition have been reported. For those habitats mentioned the report describes the assessment area, status and confidence level. A qualitative judgement on status or the trend of the status has been made but not a quantitative assessment, even if there is an attempt to quantify some parameters. The main pressures on each habitat have not been identified.

For the water column, the assessment is made in a general fashion based on plankton communities. In relation to phytoplankton, the taxonomic groups which were considered most relevant for the assessment are listed and the indicator 1.6.2 of the Commission Decision was used; for zooplankton, both indicator 1.6.1 and 1.6.2 were used. For the seabed, the assessment of both micro and macrofauna used indicator 1.6.1 of the Commission Decision. The species more representative of each type of seabed habitat are also listed.

Portugal indicates that the habitats listed in the Habitats Directive will be reported according to the timescale and format agreed under that Directive and lists the seven relevant habitats for the sub-division of the Continent. The report refers to OSPAR and to the Convention on Biological Diversity but just in general terms, and not specifically in relation to the habitats requiring special protection under these agreements. It does however refer to three specific areas as “special habitats” – the Reserva Natural das Ilhas Berlengas (a natural reserve consisting on a group of island locate 5.7 miles of the coast), the Parque Marinho Professor Luiz Saldanha (a natural park which is part of Natura 2000) and the Gorringe Bank (a underwater mountain located in southwest area of the sub-division).";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Features:
The initial assessment by Portugal of biological features is considered adequate.

Portugal;D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Portugal has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor level only. No criteria or indicators are provided. The GES definition is a mere reformulation of the definition of the Directive but it differs in one aspect. Portugal has not qualified the duration of the changes to the hydrographical conditions (e.g. permanent). Although it is presumed that this is what is meant by Portugal considering that hydrographical parameters continuously change under natural drivers (day/night, season, meteorological conditions, etc.) and that such changes by themselves should not alter GES.

“Conditions” as used by Portugal probably refers to a specific nominal regime, and “changes” to permanent changes of this regime related to human activities; but the nature, time or space scale and origin of the undesired changes are not specified;

No threshold values, reference conditions or indications on scale (while spatial scales are specified in IA) are provided and there is no reference to the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters or to the OSPAR approach. 

There is a lack of specificity with regard to certain terms such as “significant” or “affect the ecosystems”. It seems from the Portuguese text (not significant OR...) that “significant” should be distinct from “changes affecting the ecosystems”. In this case, it is unclear what a significant change is (e.g. related to change of certain parameters – but then which ones and in which range). Then the ecosystems specifically covered by the definition are not determined, and the nature (e.g. short term small scale reversible effects or only permanent or/and large scale negative effects) and type (e.g. destruction of habitats, ecosystems functions affected) of the undesired effects are not specified. ";The GES definition of Portugal for D7 is assessed as inadequate. The definition lacks many details with regard to the various characteristics it covers. It does not refer to the relevant WFD normative definitions. As such the proposed definition is insufficient for assessing if and when GES will be achieved.;"- GES is defined at descriptor level and is very close to the MSFD definition
- Not specific enough

Portugal;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"A partial assessment – mainly qualitative – has been carried out for permanent hydrographical changes in the Continental sub-division. The lack of a more complete assessment is justified in very broad terms by the size of the area and the local character of the pressure. A list of the main structures is provided which includes spurs, jetties and breakwaters. Coastal defence, ports, and thermal power stations are indicated as causes of the pressure and a few specific projects are expressly mentioned. Even though there is no express mention to OSPAR QSR the assessment appears to be consistent with the findings for Region IV. 

It is indicated that the structures that can cause changes in the hydrographical conditions have very limited impacts and only at local level. GES is considered to be achieved, although with an estimate medium degree of confidence, for all the three marine units of the sub-division.

There is no indication of trends and no identification of habitats or ecosystemic functions potentially affected. There is no identification of gaps and no plans proposed to address potential gaps. Portugal however makes a judgement that the level of the pressure is low and localized and that there is no evidence of impacts.";The initial assessment of Portugal for pressure permanent hydrographical changes is assessed as partially adequate. All areas have been covered and the main marine coastal pressures have been taken into account (even if no pressure from watershed has been reported).

Portugal;D7;Consistency ;;"The initial assessment of permanent hydrographical changes and their impacts is formally consistent with the definition of GES, mainly because of the way GES is defined. In fact there is little correlation between the definition of GES and the outcomes of the initial assessment (e.g. GES refers to the impact on ecosystems which is not properly covered in the initial assessment). 

The consistency between targets and the initial assessment and between targets and GES was not assessed since no specific environmental targets were established by Portugal to address permanent hydrographical changes and their impacts.";;;;
Portugal;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Portugal has defined D8 for the Continental subdivision at descriptor level. The definition seems to incorporate the two criteria of the Commission Decision on concentration and effects of contaminants. However, it is uncertain whether Portugal means “effects of contaminant” when it refers to “impacts and threats to the ecosystem” (see below). It is therefore uncertain whether criterion 8.2 is covered by the GES definition. 

Portugal does not define its GES in reference to the Water Framework Directive or the Environmental Quality Standards Directive. It does not refer to the OSPAR’s Environmental Assessment Criteria either. It is not clear why Portugal says that there is no definition established by the JRC and OSPAR when both organisations have produced advice on D8 including recommended criteria and indicators to be used to define GES. 

While the first part of the definition mentions concentrations of contaminants, there is no specification of reference levels (e.g. EQS, EACs, national standards, etc.) and no specification of the contaminants concerned (although these might have been defined in the initial assessment). The threshold value used by Portugal to determine if its waters are at GES is based on a spatial assessment of the impacts on the ecosystem. Portugal defines “the impacts and threats to the ecosystem” as “deviations compared with established reference conditions”. It is unclear whether this means “deviations of concentrations of contaminants” or if it also includes certain biological effects of contaminants on ecosystem components. Portugal does not specify what the reference conditions are. Presumably they have been defined in the initial assessment and relate to the relevant legislation. Again, this is an interpretation and is not clear from the text. 

The basis of the Portuguese GES definition for D8 is the setting of an aggregation rule that less than 10% of marine waters should deviate from the reference conditions. Portugal acknowledges that this condition is based on expert judgement and follows recommendation from the JRC for Descriptor 5. It is unclear why Portugal refers to Descriptor 5 in its definition of GES for D8. In any case, there is no evidence of such recommendation in the JRC report on Descriptor 5. 

In the introduction to its GES definition, Portugal quotes the Commission Decision and refers to the conclusion of the initial assessment. But it does not provide any further indication that would be relevant to assess the adequacy of the GES definition for D8.";The definition of D8 by Portugal is considered inadequate. It does not refer to any of the internationally-agreed standards for contaminants (EQS/WFD, EACs) or even to national legislation. The criterion it uses to establish GES is based on expert judgement and there is no clear explanation of how it has been established. Presumably this has been done in the initial assessment. In any case, the use of a 10% threshold value can be considered inadequate as this can represent a large area of the Portuguese marine waters if monitoring for contaminants in Portugal is limited (few sites). ;"- GES defined at descriptor level

Portugal;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Portugal has done an assessment of contamination by hazardous substances following the criteria of the Commission Decision. However, at the beginning of the assessment, Portugal acknowledges that it has not assessed the effects/impacts of contaminants on ecosystem components because of a lack of data and knowledge on cause/effect relationships in its marine waters. 

The assessment of contamination has been done in seven different assessment areas, A1, A2, B1.1, B1.2, B2, C1 and C2. It has been done on the basis of the criteria and methodological standards referred to in the Commission Decision, such as Directive 2008/105/EC (EQS); Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD) and in ICES Advice 2008 Book 1 (ICES, 2008). No reference is made however to OSPAR’s Environmental Assessment Criteria. 

Portugal provides information on land-, sea- and air-based sources of contamination in the various assessment areas. The main sources are fluvial-estuarine inputs (for coastal areas) and shipping for offshore areas. It makes a quantitative assessment of the concentrations of 32 pollutants in the marine environment. The pollutants selected cover heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg among others), phenols, PCBs, PBDEs, PAHs and other organic compounds (including DDT and TBT). Portugal also provides the list of species that were used to make the measurements in biota (about 30 species).  

The methodology put in place by Portugal assesses the deviation between the current concentrations of the substances, measured in three matrices (water, sediment and biota), and reference levels (EQS for Cd, Hg, Pb and PAH benzo-a-pirene; WHO for other heavy metals; ICES for PCBs; unclear where the reference levels for the other substances come from). A deviation is considered to be caused by human pressure, when for synthetic substances, the current concentrations of the contaminants are above the reference levels and, for heavy metals, they are twice as high as the reference levels. For heavy metals, Portugal takes into account the natural variability of these contaminants.  

For each assessment area, Portugal provides details of the deviation (or lack thereof) of current concentrations of contaminants with respect to reference levels and an assessment of the extent of the assessment area affected by the contamination. The result of the assessment is that in 6 areas out of 7, the current status is at GES. It is not clear what method is used to aggregate the results by contaminants to the level of the assessment area and come to the conclusion that a certain extent of the assessment area is affected. In any case, Portugal has used the threshold value of 10% of the area affected to make its final judgement in relation to GES. For each area, Portugal also provides an assessment of the level of confidence in the results and for 5 areas out of 7, Portugal acknowledges that the level of confidence is low.

Radionuclides
Portugal has not made an assessment of contamination by radionuclides as it says that it is not relevant for the marine waters of the Continental subdivision. 

Acute pollution events
Portugal has not made an assessment of the contamination by oil spills or release of oil products and their impact on biota. Portugal mentions that the cases of spills of oil or petroleum products were detected mainly in the transitional waters of Portugal and that indicator 8.2.2 was not used for the initial assessment but it does not provide a justification as to why no assessment of the level of contamination and the impacts on ecosystem components has ever been done for these rare events. ";The initial assessment of contamination of the Portuguese marine waters by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered partially adequate. While Portugal has clearly made an effort to assess the current status in relation to internationally-agreed standards (and in particular the EQS), it has not assessed at all the impacts of contaminants on ecosystem component. No assessment has been done of contamination by radionuclides and acute pollution events either. ;"- Description of relevant sources of contamination

Portugal;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Portugal has reported three targets for D8. Two of them (Targets 1 and 2) are actually more relevant for D9 than for D8 and will therefore be assessed in the section on D9. But it is noted that they should also help progress on D8. In particular Target 1 should help gather knowledge on bioaccumulation in biota, which is clearly a gap in the current assessment. The objective of the targets is basically to improve knowledge and collect more data in areas where gaps have been identified. The targets are rather measures to increase knowledge and improve the assessment than actual targets to help achieve GES. They are neither pressure-, impact- or state-based targets. 

Target 3 is specifically defined for D8. Again, it is not a target to help reach GES but rather a measure to improve the assessment methodology and gather better data. The target is generic and not specific. Although it is not specified, it is assumed that the concentrations covered in the target are those covered in the initial assessment. The target has no timeline so it is not possible for when this re-assessment should be done and what the purpose of it is (e.g. Define better targets? Define a more specific GES definition?) It is consistent that the area targeted should be B1.1 as it is the area Portugal says is not at GES but the target is not defined to improve the state of the area or reduce the pressures, only to increase data. 

Portugal has also reported one generic target on monitoring which is applicable to D8 and is analysed in the cross-cutting section. In addition, Portugal has indicated that, in relation to D8, the targets must be compatible with the objectives of the Commission Communication on Maritime Spatial Planning, as well as with the objectives of Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system in relation to acute pollution events, with the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, the MARPOL Convention and Directive 2000/59/EC on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues, in relation to ship pollution, to the OSPAR, Oslo and Paris Conventions specifically on marine pollution, and to the WFD, inter alia, to gradually reduce emissions of priority substances and minimize the risks of accidental pollution. ";The set of targets defined by Portugal to cover Descriptor 8 is considered as inadequate. The targets reported are more plans to address knowledge and data gaps than actual targets to ensure GES is achieved. In addition, they do not cover the major gap in relation to contaminants which is the impacts of contaminants on ecosystem components. ;"- Knowledge targets to gather more data rather than state-, impact- or pressure-targets
- No coverage of main gap in relation to D8, i.e. impact of contaminants on ecosystem components";1;Inadequate
Portugal;D8;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the level of contamination of Portuguese marine waters is generally consistent with the definition of GES considering that this one is unspecific and general. The link between the methodology used to make a judgement of the current contamination status of marine waters in relation to GES and the methodology provided in the GES definition is not clear. While the same threshold value of 10% of assessment area affected is used in both cases, it is unclear how this result is obtained from measurements of concentration levels. 

The target defined for D8 and assessed in this section is consistent with the initial assessment in that it focuses on the area, which is currently not at GES, but its aim is not to improve the state of the area but only to collect more data. ";;;;
Portugal;D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Portugal has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor level. Indirectly however it does incorporate part of criterion 9.1 in particular in relation to the actual levels of contaminants. The second part of criterion 9.1 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded is not covered by the definition. 

The first part of the GES definition is a reformulation of the definition in the Directive but adds shellfish in addition to fish. It does not specify what is meant with Community law or other relevant regulations. It could be interpreted in such a way that it covers Regulation 1881/2006 however it seems that this was not used for the initial assessment and therefore there is no guarantee that it will be used for the assessment of GES. 

Portugal provides a quantitative threshold value for the measurement of GES (less than 10% samples to show deviation from the regulatory levels). It is understood that a “positive deviation” means a higher level than the reference values (and not in the sense of an improvement of the concentrations).

There is no specification of what contaminants or species are covered by the definition. Presumably these have been defined in the initial assessment, considering the strong links between the IA and the definition of GES but it is not certain.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. It is a reformulation of the text of the Directive but since this one integrates an element of measurability (reference to levels established in the law), the Portuguese definition is potentially measurable. GES is defined only for part of criterion 9.1, there is no mention of the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded. In addition, the definition lacks specification on what regulatory levels are addresses by the definition (in particular considering that Regulation 1881/2006 is not used for the IA) and on the contaminants and species covered. ;"- GES definition at descriptor level

- Addition of an aggregation rule

Portugal;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Portugal has made an assessment of the level of contamination from hazardous substances of fish, shellfish and other seafood. It explains that it has done this assessment on the basis of the criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision and using standards from Directive 2008/105/EC (EQSD), Directive 2001/22/EC (on the sampling methods and methods of analysis for the control of levels of lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-MCPD in foodstuffs). It also mentions the ICES advice Book 1 (ICES 2008). 

It should be noted that Portugal does not refer to Regulation 1881/2006. Directive 2001/22/EC covers sampling methodology but does not include reference values. The Directive does refer in the recitals to Regulation 466/2001, which was then repealed by Regulation 1881/2006. Since Portugal provides reference values per substance, it is not clear where these come from (Regulation 466/2001 or Regulation 1881/2006). Some values may be equal to values in Regulation 1881/2006 however since it is not specified to which species the values reported correspond, it is not possible to assess whether the values are in line with Regulation 1881/2006. 

Portugal provides the list of substances used for the assessment which cover heavy metals, PCBs, and PAHs. However, as mentioned, Portugal does not provide the list of species (or even group type) that has been assessed. It provides a number of tables where are listed the species, in which regulatory levels have been exceeded (e.g. the Atlantic horse mackerel or the common octopus) and tables showing the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded for certain species. No time reference is provided for these ones however.  

In the section on GES, Portugal makes a final judgement on the current status of its marine waters with regard to contamination of fish and seafood in relation to GES. This final judgement is based on the assessments made for each area in the section on the initial assessment. Only two of these assessments explicitly refer to the 10% threshold value but it is assumed that this has been used throughout to make a final judgement with regard to GES.

Microbial pathogens
Portugal has reported on microbial pathogens. Portugal made an assessment for the level of pressure and impacts related to microbial pathogens, only for bathing water. The level of the pressure is considered as good. Shellfish waters are not covered by the assessment although Portugal has a large shellfish aquaculture sector.  ";The initial assessment of the contamination by hazardous substances of fish and other seafood (including by microbial pathogens) is considered partially adequate. Portugal provides a detailed description of the measurements made to assess the level of contamination in fish and seafood however it is not clear what the reference levels used are and if they are in line with the minimum requirements (Regulation 1881/2006 and amendments).;"- Detailed and quantitative description of the measurements made to assess level of contamination of fish and seafood

Portugal;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Portugal has defined two targets to cover D9. They are said to also cover D8 but are quite specific to contamination in fish and seafood and therefore are assessed here. 

Target 1 aims to improve knowledge on bioaccumulation of contaminants in biota. The target is generic and not specific. It is not clear which species are covered by the target and exactly what variations should be analysed. In any case, it is not a target defined to help reach GES but rather an objective to increase knowledge. 

Target 2 is related to monitoring rather than being an actual target to help achieve GES. It states that the current decreasing trends in contaminants in fish should be “followed”, which is understood as a synonym of “monitored”. 

Finally, Portugal has also reported one generic target on monitoring which is applicable to D8 and is analysed in the cross-cutting section.";The set of target and indicator defined by Portugal to cover Descriptor 9 is considered as inadequate. The targets are rather measures to increase knowledge and collect more data than targets to help reach GES. A more appropriate Target 2 would have been to state that the current decreasing trend in contaminants in fish should be maintained and should reach X% in 2020 in comparison to the current situation or another baseline. ;"- First target is a knowledge target and is not specific regarding which species are covered
- Second target is monitoring target and is also unspecific regarding substances and species to cover";1;Inadequate
Portugal;D9;Consistency ;;The initial assessment and the judgement made by Portugal of the level of contamination in fish and seafood is consistent with the definition of GES in the sense that it uses the same threshold value of 10% of samples below regulatory levels. They are also both equally unclear regarding the reference values that have been used to make the assessment. The targets are not inconsistent as such but do not really relate to the GES definition or to the initial assessment.  ;;;;
Romania;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Romania has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at indicator level in the reporting sheet, although some of the numbering corresponds to the criteria level. In the paper report, Romania does not provide a comprehensive definition of GES but a list of indicators to measure GES. 

The first two GES statements, indicator 1.1 and 1.2, both also relate to Descriptor 5. They are quite specific and include threshold values. Indicator 1.2 relates to the composition of benthic macrophytes in coastal and transitional waters, which is used to assess the level of anthropogenic pressure. Indicator 1.3 relates to the harbour porpoise and requires that the population of harbour porpoises stays above the current level, which can then be considered the baseline. No threshold value is proposed to specify what is meant with “larger”. Indicators 1.4.1 and 1.5.1 and both those numbered 1.7 relate to the extent of habitats characterized by specific shellfish species. Indicators 1.5.1 and 1.6.1 have defined baselines and threshold values in the reporting sheets. In the case of indicator 1.4.1, it is not clear which historical baseline will be applied. For the indicators numbered 1.7 the current state can be considered the baseline. The GES definition for indicator 1.6.1 refers to the density of a specific shellfish species (Donacilla cornea).

Species
The Romanian GES covers only one species of marine mammals (i.e. the harbour porpoise in indicator 1.3) but does not cover any representatives of seabirds, fish or cephalopods (marine reptiles are most likely not relevant). For mammals, the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncates), which are mentioned extensively in the initial assessment as a species being impacted by fisheries, are not at all covered in the GES definition. The initial assessment also focuses on a number of fish species (anchovy, dogfish, horse mackerel, sprat, turbot and whiting) which are not all covered in the GES definition. Indicator 1.6.1 covers the habitat condition of just a single typical species of shellfish.  Both indicators 1.7 also cover shellfish species. Only the Mytilus galloprovincialis (the Mediterranean mussel), covered in the initial assessment, is not included in the GES definition. 

Habitats 
Indicator 1.1 covers sea column habitats albeit at a very low level of detail. Indicator 1.2 and indicator 5.3.1 which is provided for Descriptor 5 are related to macrophytes. The remaining indicators, which are specific and are reported with threshold values and baselines most of the time, relate to specific habitats but do not cover all those mentioned in the initial assessment (e.g. habitat 1170-10 is missing from the GES definition). 

Ecosystems
The shellfish communities mentioned for the indicators numbered 1.7 are definitely not sufficient to represent the ecosystem in a holistic manner and it is therefore not considered that indicators 1.7 in the Romanian definition are indicators of the ecosystem structure, as per criterion 1.7 of the Commission Decision.  

All species and habitats covered in the Romanian GES definition are already listed/protected by the Bucharest Convention, which means that Romania does not consider any other non-listed species in its GES definition. Biodiversity elements are therefore not all covered equally.

Finally several indicators start with the phrase “GES could be defined” which suggests GES for that indicator is actually not defined.";The GES definition for D1 by Romania is considered inadequate. The GES definition is specific to only a small number of species and habitats which do not sufficiently cover the species, species groups and habitats present in Romanian waters. Some of the GES definitions are also very non-committal (“GES could be defined”) (e.g. 1.3, 1.4.3 and 1.5.1) and/or lack thresholds (e.g. 1.3, 1.4, 1.7). No justification is given for the gaps. Finally the use of the current state as the baseline for GES is not considered adequate. ;"- GES defined only for small number of specific habitats and species

- Fish, seabirds and cephalopods are not covered
- Habitats and species covered are already protected by other mechanisms

Romania;D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
In the fields to report on functional groups in the reporting sheet, Romania has reported on demersal and pelagic fish. For both groups of fish, very limited information is reported. For both, it has assessed the group’s relative abundance and considers them altered mainly due to the high level of fishing effort at regional level (whereas it is rather low at national level). For both functional groups, Romania does not conclude on the current status of the groups (good or not good) but assesses that currently fishing effort is much higher than Fmsy and that the current status is declining. 

In the reporting sheets, Romania reports on a number of species that are listed by the Bucharest Convention: anchovy, dogfish, horse mackerel, sprat, turbot, whiting, short-beaked common dolphin, harbour porpoise and common bottlenose dolphin. All these species are reported by Romania as being listed under the Bucharest Convention. For all species, Romania describes mostly the population size of species and their distribution (with varying level of details depending on the species). The condition of populations is never assessed because of insufficient data. Romania makes a judgement on the current status of species in relation to GES only for the fish species (and for the criterion of population size), concluding that status is good for whiting (but declining), turbot (but declining), sprat (and stable), dogfish (but declining) and anchovy (but declining). However these conclusions seem to be in contradiction with the judgement at functional group level that fishing effort is much higher than Fmsy. Most of the assessment related to commercial fisheries focuses on the by-catch of dolphins, which is not reflected in the assessment of status of the cetacean species reported by Romania under the description of its biological features. 

In the paper report additional historic observations and research data is provided. 

Habitats
In the reporting sheets Romania has provided an initial assessment for a number of habitats with the following EUNIS classification codes: 1110-3b, 1140-3, 1170-10. All the habitats reported upon by Romania are listed under the national classification of the Habitats Directive. Romania does not report on habitat types that are not already protected under the Habitats Directive. 

The distribution and extent for each habitat are considered altered but stable while the habitat conditions are considered in line with natural conditions and stable except for habitat 1170-10 for which the habitat condition is declining. The habitat extent and condition for each of the habitats has been judged as being at good status. The habitat distributions are however indicated as being greatly reduced for three of the habitats and reduced for one compared to the reference period in the 1960s. The following habitat forming species are also covered in the reporting sheets: Cystoseira barbata, phanerogame Zostera noltii, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Modiolus phaseolinus, Lentidium mediterraneum. With regard to the first two of these species it is mentioned that recovery process is noticed for these species in comparison to previous years. In the paper report further attention is given to habitats present in a number of Natura 2000 sites. The assessment provides quantitative data on distribution and extent of these habitats within specific areas but does not discuss their condition. In the paper report habitat condition is however reported on in relation to the composition of and states of macroalgae and macrophytes. Water column habitats are not assessed in the reporting sheets although the phytoplankton community is discussed under ecosystems. In the paper report both abiotic and biotic attributes of the water column are assessed and phytoplankton and zooplankton communities are reported on. 

Ecosystems
In the reporting sheets Romania has filled out the ecosystem fields but provides data on specific habitat forming species and phytoplankton abundance. This deals only with specific ecosystem attributes rather than the ecosystems as a whole. ";The initial assessment by Romania of the biological features in its marine waters is considered inadequate. While the assessment of habitats is relatively detailed it focuses mostly on habitats covered under the Habitat Directive. The assessment of functional groups and species is particularly poor and focuses only on a number of fish stocks (which are also reported for D3) and a few species of dolphins, as well as a number of lower trophic species. Romania has not reported at all on birds and no justification is provided for this gap apart from stating that there is not enough data. ;"Features:
- Information on habitats is relatively detailed but focuses mostly on habitats covered under the Habitats Directive
- Information on functional groups and species is particularly poor and focuses only on a number of fish stocks and a few species of dolphins, as well as a number of lower trophic species";1;Inadequate
Romania;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Romania has defined 14 environmental targets (and no indicators) related to D1 in the reporting sheet. In the paper report, it has defined a number of targets for different areas. In the paper report, the targets relate to the maintenance of good conservation status for a number of habitats and species. The targets therefore seem to relate exclusively to habitats and species already protected under the Habitats Directive. 

The targets in the reporting sheet and in the paper report are relatively similar, in that they cover mostly the same elements. The targets in the reporting sheet cover a number of benthic species not covered in the paper report (although they are probably indirectly associated with the habitats). This includes the Donacilla, the Donax trunculus and the Pholas dactylus bivalves. 

Overall the targets do not cover all biodiversity components – only selected fish, cetaceans and a narrow range of seabed components are addressed (zoobenthos, macrophytes/phytobenthos). Water column is not addressed. The species covered are three species of fish (Alosa Immaculata, Alosa tanaica, sturgeon) and two species of dolphin (Tursiops truncatus and Phocoena phocoena). Seabirds are not addressed. 

In the paper report, as in the reporting sheet, specific indicators and threshold values are defined for each habitat/species (e.g. area occupied by the habitat or the median size of a specimen). The targets mostly aim at attaining values that are equal or greater than the threshold value. In the paper report, this is translated by “maintaining” good status, which could indicate that Romania considers these various components to already be in good status. The targets in the paper report, along with their associated indicators, are SMART. ";The set of target and indicators developed by Romania to cover D1 is considered partially adequate. The targets focus on the specific habitats and species assessed in Romanian waters and aim to maintain their good conservation status. The targets in the paper report are SMART since they have specific indicators and threshold values. The habitats and species covered are all listed/protected species as per the Habitat Directive and the Bucharest Convention and included in the GES definition and therefore achievement of the targets/indicators would ensure achieving GES. Non-listed species are not covered by the targets.;"- Focus on specific habitats and species assessed in Romanian waters

- SMART targets which would ensure that GES is achieved";2;Partially adequate 
Romania;D1;Consistency ;;Consistency is quite high for the reporting for Descriptor 1 as the GES definition, the targets and the initial assessment have all focused on the same habitats and species. Some inconsistency is related to the fact that Romania reports a relatively degraded state for a number of fish stocks and describes extensively the problems caused by dolphin by-catches under the assessment of the pressure from commercial fisheries but has not proposed any target under D1 related to reducing the fishing effort. Such targets have been defined for D3 however. ;;;;

Romania;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"In the reporting sheet, Romania has defined GES at the criteria level. However, there is no definition for Descriptor 2 in the paper report.

The definition for criterion 2.1 applies only to demersal fish species and to coastal waters. The definition for criterion 2.2 applies also only to coastal waters and to all NIS. Both definitions are unclear. With regard to the first definition, it does not seem realistic to prevent NIS from becoming invasive. The second definition is very general. In the absence of baseline or threshold, it is not possible to measure whether GES is achieved or maintained.

The definition of GES does not meet the minimum requirements as it does not mention the increase of NIS, new introduction of NIS or further spread of NIS.

For both criteria, Romania notes that there is no method to determine GES according to the 2010 Commission Decision and that the methodology will be developed in the coming period and the results of its application provided in the second cycle of the MSFD reporting. No action plan or specifics is provided about the missing information. It is not clear which information is missing or why and what will be done about it. ";The GES definition for D2 is considered as inadequate. It does not reflect the minimum requirements. It lacks thresholds and baselines. GES definitions set at criteria level are generally worded. While Romania recognises that the definitions need further development, missing data is not identified and there is no plan as to how to address these gaps.;"- GES does not reflect minimum requirements

Romania;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Romania provided an inventory of NIS, distinguishing between coastal (5 species), transitional and marine areas, respectively 5, 2 and 3 species, indicating the predominant habitats where these species are to be found and, except for transitional waters, the main pathway, which is shipping. The paper report includes a list of 15 species. 

In the paper report, Romania provides detailed information on distribution, abundance and spatial distribution for 11 invasive NIS (Mya arenaria, Anadara inaequivalvis, Doridella obscura, Eriocheir sinensis, Callinectes sapidus, Dyspanopeus sayi, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, Palaemon macrodactylus, Mnemiopsis leidyi, Beroe ovate, Oithona brevicornis), based on studies conducted in 2006-2011. It should be noted that three of these species are not included in the inventory provided in the reporting sheet. 

In the reporting sheet, Romania describes in a very general way the impacts of NIS. It specifies the percentage of the area affected (5 to 25% for coastal and transitional waters, 1 to 5% for marine waters). The trend for the level of pressure from NIS is assessed as stable for all three areas.  Impacts on the water column and seabed habitats are described, indicating the area affected. Romania indicates that impacts on functional groups need to be further studied to carry out a proper assessment.

For all three areas, Romania considers that the current environmental impact of NIS is acceptable because it does not lead to an undesirable disturbance of the marine ecosystem balance. If to refer to the second definition of GES commented upon above, this seems to imply that Romania considers that GES is achieved for this part of the definition. ";The initial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered partially adequate. Romania has provided an inventory of NIS (although there are some discrepancies between the paper report and the reporting sheet). There is a limited assessment of the level of pressure and impacts from the pressure.

Romania;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Romania has defined GES for Descriptor 3 at criteria level in the reporting sheet. In the paper report, it does not provide a comprehensive GES definition but a summary of the assessment of the current state of a number of stocks (turbot, sprat, anchovy and whiting) in relation to Fmsy.

The Romanian GES definition for Descriptor 3 in the reporting sheet only refers to ensuring that the fishing mortality for horse mackerel does not increase. It can be assumed that Romania considers horse mackerel stocks to be at GES however this conclusion would be more appropriate in the initial assessment. The GES definition does not correspond either to the descriptor provided in Annex I of the MSFD or to the criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision. It is also not clear why the horse mackerel was chosen as a GES indicator when in the paper report, the turbot, sprat, anchovy and whitening are mentioned and clearly have been used for the initial assessment. ";The definition of GES for descriptor 3 is considered inadequate.

The evaluation of the proportions of individuals within the population larger than the average size at sexual maturity all showed decreasing trends in the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 except for whiting which increased. 

Most of the assessment however focuses on the by-catch of dolphins. Fleets are not described in the Romanian fisheries assessment.

The reporting sheet targets also do not have timelines so they are not completely SMART. 

The paper report targets relate to increasing knowledge and increasing joint cooperation within the Black Sea in regard to managing fish stocks. The targets are however very general and not SMART.

Romania;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Romania has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at indicator level both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report, but the content reported is not the same in the reporting sheet and the paper report. On one hand, the text reported in the reporting sheets is more developed than in the paper report but the additional text is mostly a summary of the initial assessment. On the other hand, indicator 5.2.3 (abundance of opportunistic macroalgae) is only covered in the paper report, which addresses all the indicators of the 2010 Commission Decision. The definition of the reporting sheets, together with the indicator 5.2.3, reported only in the paper report, is the basis of this analysis.

Quantitative values are presented for nutrient concentrations (indicator 5.1.1), but unusually, Romania has broken DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) into its constituent components of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium. It is not specified whether the nutrient ‘standards’ presented are threshold or baseline levels, but the monitoring time period from which these standards are developed (1960-65) makes it almost certain that they are baseline values. However, Romania does not specify what the corresponding threshold standards for GES would be (e.g. 50% greater than the baseline). It is also unclear what reporting metrics are to be used – winter averages, annual means, etc. Nutrient baselines are presented only for coastal/transitional waters, but not for marine waters; instead, for marine waters GES would appear to be based on a molar N:P ratio of 10-16 (indicator 5.1.2) . A transparency threshold of 3.0 m (indicator 5.2.2), presumably Secchi depth, is suggested. 

GES could be represented by the stable spatial distribution of perennial species (Cystoseira, Zostera), but no maps of current distribution are presented. This is rather different to the 2010 Commission Decision criterion of ‘abundance’ (5.3.1), but would represent a suitable alternative, providing maps of current distribution can be established. No threshold or assessment methodology is offered for abundance of opportunistic macroalgae (indicator 5.2.3). It is stated that GES could be defined as a stable ratio between diatoms and dinoflagellates (indicator 5.2.4), but no further explanation or threshold is provided for coastal or offshore areas. No threshold value is given for chlorophyll (indicator 5.2.1), or for its use in determining indicator 5.2.2. Finally, a proposed GES threshold value for dissolved oxygen is proposed (75% of values measured during 1963-2007). Presumably this would be a seasonal (summer) threshold, but it not stated whether the assessment metric would be a mean value or a minimum concentration, etc.

MSFD GES appears to have been linked to WFD GES for nutrient concentrations, but not for any other criteria. It is not explained how WFD coastal phytobenthos monitoring, dissolved oxygen status or other WFD normatives would match with MSFD GES. While, the establishment of WFD chlorophyll thresholds for coastal waters is explained in the paper report, the use of these for MSFD purposes is not made clear. The Black Sea Commission has not developed a regional approach to MSFD assessment and Romania does not appear to have borrowed or developed techniques from other European RSCs. ";The GES definition of Romania for Descriptor 5 is assessed as inadequate. The definition of GES reported is more a series of potential criteria-based sub-definitions, to be further investigated as environmental targets. The GES definition is most of the time non-committal (“GES could be defined as”). The failure to include chlorophyll concentrations (or phytoplankton biovolume) in the definition of GES is particularly worrying, although a consideration of macrophytobenthos status and changes in floristic composition in the definition is encouraging, as is a possible link between WFD and MSFD GES normatives for nutrients (albeit poorly explained).;"- The definition of GES reported is rather a series of potential criteria-based sub-definitions and is most of the time non-committal

Romania;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Romania has carried out an initial assessment on the level of pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the Black Sea. Romania acknowledges a series of information gaps and indicates that the appropriate data will be provided in the second cycle of the MSFD reporting. In the reporting sheets, Romania used three different assessment areas (coastal waters, transitional waters and territorial waters (excluding coastal and transitional waters)) and presented mainly descriptive information, although some quantification is provided. The assessment covers loads and concentrations of the relevant nutrients – nitrogen and phosphorus – as well as of organic matter but the data presented is incomplete. In any case, Romania provides trends and conclusive judgements on the current level of pressure for most cases (but the threshold values used are unclear). 

There appears to be little attempt at nutrient budgeting; however, seasonality and depth profiling of nutrient concentrations is usefully explained. Inflows from the Danube River and, to a lesser extent, the River Dniester dominate the hydrography and chemistry of Romanian marine waters, but this is not to downplay the importance of coastal population centres in terms of localised impacts. Nutrient budgeting of Danube nitrogen and phosphorus loads has been undertaken for the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (of which Romania is a member), but no reference appears to be made to this, so the relative importance of different nutrient sources (atmospheric deposition, municipal wastewater treatment plants, arable and livestock farming, etc.) is not stated. Historically, attention has been paid to the potential importance of silicate levels in determining phytoplankton community composition in the Black Sea, but no mention is made of this, or whether these views are still held.

Unlike other countries, Romania has attempted to include transitional waters, which are covered under the Water Framework Directive, in both its definition of GES and initial assessment under the MSFD, without any justification for doing so. Decisions about which features are relevant with regard to the assessment of impacts appear questionable, or at least insufficiently explained. Overall, impacts, in particular are weakly covered. No judgements or trends have been provided on the levels of impacts on the water column and seabed habitats.";The initial assessment of Romania for pressure eutrophication is assessed as partially adequate.

The information on impacts is very limited.;"- Covers loads and concentrations of the relevant nutrients and organic matter but the data presented is incomplete

Romania;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Romania has defined eight environmental targets and associated indicators to address Descriptor 5 in the reporting sheet. These are not targets in the usual understanding of the term, but rather are statements describing how GES could potentially be defined and presumably requiring further evaluation. All of these targets are described as GES descriptors, requiring no thresholds, and have been reported also under Article 9.

The targets reported are all impact-based and not SMART, though they are specific. Some rely on trend evaluation as the threshold metric (5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.4), others have a built-in threshold (5.1.2, 5.2.2, 5.3.2), albeit without an evaluation period or related metric (e.g. annual mean) and for others no basis is described for assessment purposes (5.3.1). There is no conflict between the targets and indicators reported, but it is unclear why GES will only achieved in offshore waters by a stable DIP levels but reducing DIN concentrations.

In the paper report, Romania has reported one overall target and three sub-targets to address D5. They are completely different from those in the reporting sheet since they are all pressure-based and focus on the reduction of nutrient inputs from land-based sources of contamination. The targets are ambitious but not operational or SMART since no thresholds are defined and some of them are worded very vaguely (“improved farming practices”). It is not clear how their achievement can be measured. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Romania for D5 is assessed as inadequate. The environmental targets reported in the reporting sheet are actually indicators and thresholds for the achievement of GES. They are all impact-specific but not SMART.

Romania;D5;Consistency ;;The definition of GES is not completely consistent with the initial assessment as impacts are addressed by GES but not described in much detail in the initial assessment. The initial assessment appears to consider very few pressures – coastal Waste Water Treatment Plants and the River Danube only, with no source apportionment of the latter, and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen does not appear to have been considered as pressure. While the targets are associated with most of the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision, impacts are poorly assessed due to a paucity of data. It is not clear how the targets will contribute to the achievement of GES.;;;;

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Inadequate; 1):

Romania has carried out an initial assessment in relation to physical damage but not physical loss as there was no data regarding this pressure. Physical damage is only described in a very general way referring to the effects of siltation and removal and abrasion of plants. 1 to 5% of the Romanian marine environment and 5 to 25% of seabed habitats are estimated to be affected by physical damage. 

In the paper report, physical damage is regarded as one of the environmental issues caused by hydraulic activities, shipping, fishing and marine recreational activities. It is not assessed as a separate pressure on the ecosystem. Romania describes the different activities that over the years have caused coastal erosion, changes in shoreline morphology and bottom slope and changes in the structure of the substrate. The activities include hydraulic infrastructures, coastal protection, construction of ports, etc. Romania also describes the impacts from these activities on the local fauna, and in particular on macrophytes and other types of algae (e.g. Cystoseira and Zostera marina), and on different substrate types.

Habitats
In the reporting sheets Romania has provided an initial assessment for a number of habitats with the following EUNIS classification codes: 1110-3b, 1140-3, 1170-10. All the habitats reported upon by Romania are listed under the national classification of the Habitats Directive. Romania does not report on habitat types that are not already protected under the Habitats Directive. 

The distribution and extent for each habitat are considered altered but stable while the habitat conditions are considered in line with natural conditions and stable except for habitat 1170-10 for which the habitat condition is declining. The habitat extent and condition for each of the habitats has been judged as being at good status. The habitat distributions are however indicated as being greatly reduced for three of the habitats and reduced for one compared to the reference period in the 1960s. The following habitat forming species are also covered in the reporting sheets: Cystoseira barbata, phanerogame Zostera noltii, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Modiolus phaseolinus, Lentidium mediterraneum. With regard to the first two of these species it is mentioned that recovery process is noticed for these species in comparison to previous years. In the paper report further attention is given to habitats present in a number of Natura 2000 sites. The assessment provides quantitative data on distribution and extent of these habitats within specific areas but does not discuss their condition. In the paper report habitat condition is however reported on in relation to the composition of and states of macroalgae and macrophytes.

Romania;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Romania has not defined environmental targets for Descriptor 6.

From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Partially adequate, 2):
Romania has defined 14 environmental targets (and no indicators) related to D1 in the reporting sheet. In the paper report, it has defined a number of targets for different areas. In the paper report, the targets relate to the maintenance of good conservation status for a number of habitats and species. The targets therefore seem to relate exclusively to habitats and species already protected under the Habitats Directive.
The targets in the reporting sheet and in the paper report are relatively similar, in that they cover mostly the same elements. The targets in the reporting sheet cover a number of benthic species not covered in the paper report (although they are probably indirectly associated with the habitats). This includes the Donacilla, the Donax trunculus and the Pholas dactylus bivalves.
Overall the targets do not cover all biodiversity components – only selected fish, cetaceans and a narrow range of seabed components are addressed (zoobenthos, macrophytes/phytobenthos). Water column is not addressed. The species covered are three species of fish (Alosa Immaculata, Alosa tanaica, sturgeon) and two species of dolphin (Tursiops truncatus and Phocoena phocoena). Seabirds are not addressed.
In the paper report, as in the reporting sheet, specific indicators and threshold values are defined for each habitat/species (e.g. area occupied by the habitat or the median size of a specimen). The targets mostly aim at attaining values that are equal or greater than the threshold value. In the paper report, this is translated by “maintaining” good status, which could indicate that Romania considers these various components to already be in good status. The targets in the paper report, along with their associated indicators, are SMART.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of target and indicators developed by Romania to cover D1 is considered partially adequate.

Romania;D6;Consistency ;;Consistency is quite high for the reporting for Descriptor 1 as the GES definition, the targets and the initial assessment have all focused on the same habitats and species. Some inconsistency is related to the fact that Romania reports a relatively degraded state for a number of fish stocks and describes extensively the problems caused by dolphin by-catches under the assessment of the pressure from commercial fisheries but has not proposed any target under D1 related to reducing the fishing effort. Such targets have been defined for D3 however.;;;;

Romania;D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Romania reports very little information on hydrographical changes in the reporting sheet. On hydrological processes, Romania reports that the increase in the thermic regime influences the structure of phytoplankton communities, mostly changes in the diatoms /dinoflagellates ratio.

Romania;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"In the reporting sheet, Romania has provided a definition for GES for D8 at the indicator level, covering only indicator 8.1.1 (and therefore criterion 8.1). Nothing is mentioned about criterion 8.2. However, the definition in the reporting sheet is actually a summary of the initial assessment, providing information on concentration levels of heavy metals between 2006 and 2011 and assessing them against the EQS. It does not provide a definition of what is considered GES for Romanian marine waters. 

In the paper report, Romania does not provide a comprehensive definition of GES either but provides a list of substances that should be used to measure GES and a list of reference documents for the limit values to be complied with. The list of substances, which Romania says cover the priority substances identified under OSPAR, HELCOM, MEDPOL, BSC, AMAP (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) and the WFD, includes: heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr) to be measured in sediment and biota and a number of synthetic substances (hexachlorobenzene, lindane, heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, DDT, anthracene, phenanthrene, benzo (a) anthracene, chrysene, fluoranthene, naftaline, pyrene, benzo (a) pyrene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, benzo (k) fluoranthene, benzo (ghi) perylene, indeno [1,2,3-c, d] pyrene) to be measured in water, sediment and biota. It should be noted that mercury is not included in the list of heavy metals to be used to measure GES when it is a priority substance at EU level and a substance which is well-monitored in Europe.  

Although it is not stated clearly, it is understood that concentration levels of these substances should not exceed certain reference levels to achieve GES. Romania provides a list of the regulatory texts or international standards to be used to assess concentration levels, including the Water Framework Directive (and transposing Romanian legislation), the OSPAR EAC and BAC and the EQS Directive. It does not explain in detail which reference levels should be used to measure which substance in which matrix. It is for instance not clear which standards will be used to measure concentrations of HCB in biota since both OSPAR and the EQS Directive have standards for this substance. Apart from a reference to the BSC list of priority substances, there is no further reference to the Bucharest Convention, its protocols or any of the work undertaken by the Black Sea Commission on pollutants. 

In addition, Romania has added a condition that the concentrations of these substances in biota (and in sediment for synthetic substances) should not increase. Because of the lack of a comprehensive definition, it is uncertain whether this is an additional condition to the requirement that concentration levels should not exceed reference levels (i.e. it is a good practice) or if it is to be applied instead of the first condition, in case concentration levels do exceed reference levels.  

Romania does not address criterion 8.2 on effects of contaminants through the coverage of specific biological effects (e.g. imposex) and does not address at all acute pollution events. Through the use of OSPAR’s EAC, it can be considered that some attention is given to biological effects since the OSPAR EAC are developed in an integrated manner taking into account contaminants’ concentrations and their biological effects. ";The definition of GES for D8 by Romania is considered inadequate. While the relevant reference levels and substances are mentioned in the paper report, Romania has not provided a comprehensive definition of GES for D8, which would allow in 2020 to measure with certainty what constitutes GES. In addition, Romania does not address biological effects and acute pollution events. ;"- No real GES definition, only reference to relevant regulations

Romania;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
In the reporting sheet, Romania provides a quantitative assessment of concentration levels of hazardous substances in the marine environment but provides only a very limited description of the land-based sources of contamination and input loads and only for heavy metals. Riverine inputs are considered to constitute the main source of input of heavy metals in the marine environment (0,319 tones/year for lead in coastal waters and 401,188 tones/year for chrome in transitional waters). Sea- and land-based sources of contamination are not described. In the reporting sheet, Romania mentions that the main causes for contamination by hazardous substances are industry and urban areas for the coastal waters and industry, oil and gas installations and shipping for the marine waters. In the paper report, Romania describes in much more detail sources of contamination and provides input loads for a number of synthetic substances and for most heavy metals. 

For synthetic substances, it makes an assessment of the following substances: Anthracene and organochlorine pesticides (HCB, lindane, hepatachlor, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, p,p'DDT, p,p'DDD and p,p’DDE). PAHs are also assessed under non-synthetic substances. It assesses their concentrations levels in the marine environment against levels in Directive 2008/105/EC. It concludes that for the period 2006-2011 levels of HCB, lindane and cyclodiene pesticides have exceeded limit values in 50% of cases (20% for DDT). It adds that in the last two years (2009-2011), levels have significantly decreased in comparison to 2006-2008. Romania assesses that 50-75% of its assessment area is affected by contamination by synthetic substances. Romania mentions that there is no relevant data on concentrations of organochlorine pesticides in species or functional groups (including fish and seafood for human consumption), predominant habitats and associated communities because of a lack of development of the monitoring system for this type of data. Although Romania only refers to concentration levels in ecosystem components, it is understood that the justification also applies to other types of impacts on ecosystem components (e.g. biological effects). 

For heavy metals, it makes an assessment for copper, cadmium, lead, nickel and chrome, as well as total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs). It does not assess concentration levels for mercury for coastal and marine waters, only for transitional waters. As for synthetic substances, Romania assesses the concentration levels of heavy metals in the marine environment against the EQS and concludes that the percentage of samples measured in the period 2006-2011 which exceed the regulatory limit values vary by element, area, season, special hydrological events but remains below 10%. For mercury in transitional waters, it concludes that concentration levels have exceeded the EQS for the entire period of time. 

With regard to impacts on ecosystem components, Romania acknowledges that it does not have data on the impacts of heavy metals on individual species, functional groups (including fish and seafood for human consumption), predominant habitats and associated communities because of the current state of development of the monitoring system which does not support this type of data. In the paper report, Romania describes the effects of pollutants on sediment and organisms (bioaccumulation) and makes a very limited assessment of certain effects from contamination by pesticides on marine organisms (e.g. lysosomal membrane stability).  

Romania makes a number of judgements on the current concentration levels according to GES for synthetic substances and heavy metals. For both types of substances, Romania reports that current levels are both acceptable (good) and not acceptable (not good) – i.e. the statements are contradictory – for coastal and transitional waters, using exactly the same threshold values (corresponding to the EQS). For marine waters, it does not make a conclusive judgement (good or not good) but provides the current levels for the substances used in the assessment in water, sediment and biota (Mediterranean mussel, Rapana venosa and Scapharca inaequivalvis). For all synthetic substances and TPHs, it reports that the trend in status is improving. For heavy metals, it reports that it is “unknown”. 

Radionuclides
Romania does not report on contamination by radionuclides (neither in the reporting sheet nor in the paper report). 

Acute pollution events
Romania does not describe acute pollution events in the paper report. In the reporting sheet, the information is very limited. In the assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, Romania assesses contamination by TPHs (total petroleum hydrocarbons). In addition, it describes some of the sources of acute pollution (upload-download operations of commercial ships, ship discharges and ship sinking, damaged wastewater pipes, etc.) but does not assess the level of the pressure in Romanian marine waters nor the impacts on ecosystem components. ";The assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events by Romania is considered partially adequate. Romania reports adequately on sources of contamination and input loads and makes an assessment of current concentration levels for an adequate number of substances against the EQS (but only in the reporting sheet). It does not really assess biological effects on species and functional groups. It does not assess the pressure from radioactive contamination or from acute pollution. ;"- Adequate reporting on sources of contamination and input loads

Romania;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Romania has defined ten environmental targets (and no associated indicators) to cover D8 in the reporting sheet. In the paper report, Romania has defined three targets, a state target, a pressure target and an impact target.  

The targets in the reporting sheet can be grouped into four categories, according to the substances they cover:
-	Heavy metals to be measured in water, sediment and biota
-	PAHs in water and sediment
-	TPHs in water and sediment
-	POPs in water, sediment and biota

The targets for heavy metals require concentration levels in water, sediment or biota to be maintained within agreed national, European or regional limit values. There is no further specification of what is meant with this but it is understood that it refers at least to the EQS or probably to OSPAR standards (considering that they were mentioned in the accompanying text to the GES definition), especially for measurements in sediment. This is confirmed by the impact target in the paper report, although it focuses only on measurements in sediment and biota. For PAHs and POPs in water, the targets also refer to the EQS Directive. For TPHs in water, Romania refers to national legislation but it is not certain what this refers to. In the initial assessment, Romania does not mention what reference levels are used to assess current concentration levels of TPHs. 

For PAHs, TPHs and POPs in sediment (and biota for POPs), the targets require that concentration levels are maintained “within the current limits”. It is not clear whether this means that concentrations should remain below the current limit values as defined by regulatory texts or internationally-recognized organisations (e.g. EQS Directive or OSPAR EAC) or if it means that concentration levels should not exceed levels measured during the 2012 initial assessment (i.e. “current” concentration levels). In the paper report, the state target mentions “current levels”. As there is uncertainty in the initial assessment about the current levels for these types of substances (below or above international standards), it is difficult to assess whether these targets would allow to achieve GES (if GES is achieved for these substances already, then the targets are sufficient. If GES is not achieved, they are insufficient). 

The three targets defined in the paper report are not specific enough to be SMART. The pressure-target for instance lacks details as to what is meant with “low” and how such minimization of input can be achieved (e.g. by targeting a specific human activity). The impact-target also lacks details to be SMART and in particular which organisms should be used for the sampling of heavy metals and which standards should not be exceeded (it cannot be the EQS since they have been defined in biota only for mercury). ";The set of targets defined by Romania to cover D8 is considered partially adequate. The targets focus on the relevant substances, according to the initial assessment, and require levels to be below regulatory limits. However, the targets are all state-based, none focuses on a specific pressure or source of contamination to reduce the level of pressure on the environment. As such, they read more as GES definitions than targets designed to help achieved GES.  ;"- SMART targets focusing on relevant substances and requiring them to be below regulatory levels
- No real pressure targets focusing on reducing input loads from specific pressures
- Targets are more expressions of GES";2;Partially adequate

Slovenia;D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Slovenia has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at the descriptor and criteria level in the reporting sheets and only at criteria level in the paper report. The first definition for D1, which refers to the maintenance of “Good Status” according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and to “Favourable status” according to the Habitats and Birds Directives, is not reproduced in the paper report.

Slovenia has defined GES in the same way for criteria 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 (the “species” criteria). The definition addresses species distribution (1.1) but does not directly address population size (1.2) and condition (1.3). In the accompanying text, in the paper report, Slovenia refers to “species distribution, population size and conservation”. It is not clear however that “conservation” is appropriate to cover “condition”. 

In the reporting sheet, Slovenia does not include any species or functional groups in the features addressed by the GES definitions for criteria 1.1 to 1.3. In the accompanying text to the GES definition, Slovenia provides a list of the species that are covered by the GES definition. This includes the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), the common tern (Sterna hirundo) and the little tern (Sternula albifrons). This covers turtles, only one species of marine mammals and only two species of birds. It does not cover any fish species or cephalopods. Slovenia justifies the choice of these species by mentioning that they are covered by regulations (the terns by the Birds Directive, the dolphins and turtles by the Habitats Directive). The list of species selected by Slovenia includes only protected/listed habitats, meaning that the GES definition does not address all marine species equally.

Threshold values, reference point type and baselines are not mentioned for criteria 1.1 to 1.3. The GES definition set a goal to be in “accordance with baselines as described in the initial assessment (2012) or in according with other directives”. It is not clear whether the baseline state of the IA is assumed to be at GES, i.e. using the concept of no further decline. It is also not clear which directives are addressed by the GES definition but presumably it relates to the Birds and Habitats Directives. 

Slovenia has defined GES almost the same way for criteria 1.4 (habitat distribution), 1.5 (habitat extent) and 1.6 (habitat condition). For criterion 1.4, it has added a condition that “good condition” is related to Descriptor 5 (presumable to the definition of GES for D5). The definition addresses the habitats’ extent and distribution. In the accompanying text, Slovenia specifies which habitats are covered by the GES definition. This includes rocky bottom in the lower intertidal, sediment in the bottom of the left lower intertidal, solid infralittoral and circalittoral, sedimentary bottom infralittoral and circalittoral and habitat types in the water column. Zooplankton is also referred to in the reporting sheet. In addition, a number of features are reported as part of the species but are actually more relevant under habitats. This includes coral rock (Cladocora caespitosa), seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) and Cymodocea nodosa (Pinna nobilis). Slovenia justifies selecting these habitats by stating that the Cymodocea and seagrass are included in the Annexes to the Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean (SPA/BD Protocol) of the Barcelona Convention and coral rock is a type of Mediterranean endemic species which forms large biogenic formation (e.g. facies, reefs), and is a good indicator of status development, in relation to climate change and direct human influences. 

Threshold values have been defined for criteria 1.4 and 1.6 (but not for 1.5) in terms of various indices for soft bottom benthic invertebrates and seagrass meadows (presumably taken from other directives such as the WFD), and states as a baseline that anthropogenic interventions shall be minimal. A threshold value has been defined for density of cunner (fish), which should rather have been reported under species abundance (1.1). Baselines for criterion 1.6 are much more specific than for the other criteria. The baselines focus on various aspects of seabed habitats (seagrasses using leaf length as indicator, and various appropriate multi-metric indices for benthic invertebrates) but do not cover water column habitats.

While criteria 1.1 to 1.3 seem to use either the 2012 status or the status as defined by EU directives as baselines, criteria 1.4 to 1.6 refer to ‘natural conditions’, which is assumed to mean “free from anthropogenic influences”. Slovenia does not mention acceptable deviation and it is not clear where current conditions are in relation to the target state or to what extent current states are degraded or in need of restitution. It is assumed that this is assessed in the 2012 initial assessment.

Criterion 1.7 (ecosystem structure) is addressed only in general terms, and no thresholds or reference values are given, except for the mention of ‘natural conditions’. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 1 is considered to be partially adequate. GES is defined for all criteria (although it is uncertain whether criterion 1.3 is fully covered) however the species covered by the GES definition are only listed/protected species. The coverage of habitats seems to be broader as Slovenia covers a number of littoral habitats and water column habitats. In addition, quantitative threshold values and baselines have been defined for the habitats criterion, in relation to the WFD. Reference to the relevant EU legislation and various regional and international agreements is made throughout the GES definition. The definition for criterion 1.7 means that the ecosystem is covered in a holistic manner, even though the definition is rather vague. In terms of baseline, if current status is not at GES, the use of the IA as a baseline is considered not to be appropriate. A current or past degraded state can be used as a baseline only if the ambition is to improve quality towards a reference state (reference conditions).;"- GES defined for all criteria (although uncertain if criterion 1.3 is fully covered)

Species/functional groups
In the reporting sheets Slovenia has reported on the following species/functional groups: coastal fish, pelagic elasmobranchs, demersal elasmobranchs, demersal fish and demersal cephalopods. Slovenia indicates that birds are covered under the reporting obligations of the Birds Directive and that mammals and turtles are covered under the reporting obligations of the Habitats Directive (even though they are addressed in the paper report). Each of these groups is briefly described and their state in relation to natural conditions is reported. For some groups the main causes of pressure are also listed. Judgements on the current status in relation to GES are provided only for coastal fish (good) and trends in status for relatively few groups: coastal fish (stable), pelagic and demersal elasmobranchs (declining). In addition, the following individual species are mentioned: Cladocora caespitosa, Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus and Solea solea. Trends (declining) and judgements (fully exploited or subjected to overfishing) on the current status are provided where the information is available.

Habitats
Slovenia has carried out an initial assessment on both seabed and water column habitats. The assessment is mainly qualitative and covers both seabed and water column habitats. Slovenia has reported on the following habitats: shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shallow sublittoral mixed sediment, coastal waters, littoral rock and biogenic reef, littoral sediment and Posidonia oceanica meadows. For each of the habitats reported, the information in the reporting sheets covers the habitat distribution, extension and condition, the main causes of pressure, the status of the habitat in relation to the natural status and the proportion of habitat that is altered. Trends (stable in all cases except littoral rock and biogenic reef and littoral sediment) and judgements on the current status (not good for littoral rock and biogenic reef and littoral sediment, good for shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shallow sublittoral mixed sediment and Posidonia oceanica meadows, with no conclusive judgement given for coastal waters) are also provided as are the threshold values and baselines used for these assessments. The paper report cites a considerable amount of literature and focuses on the initial assessment of mediolittoral habitat, rock infralittoral habitat, circalittoral habitat and water column. It refers a few times to the Habitats Directive.

Ecosystems
Slovenia has not reported on ecosystems.";The initial assessment by Slovenia of biological features is considered partially adequate. The information is mainly qualitative but covers, although not always in great detail, most habitat types and functional/species groups, as well as a few individual species (groups which have not been reported on will be under the Habitats and Birds Directives). Trends and judgements on status are provided in some cases. Slovenia has not reported on ecosystems.;"Features:

Slovenia;D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Slovenia has defined seven targets and associated indicators to cover Descriptor 1. A number of targets can also be considered relevant for Descriptor 6. The targets should be achieved by 2020. 

Descriptor 1 targets are linked to achieving the objectives of a number of existing pieces of legislation including the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive. Furthermore Slovenia has set as a target to achieve the objectives of the Barcelona convention. These targets which relate to these existing directives are by implication measurable. The associated indicators for these targets specify further which specific species and habitats are considered for each of the targets. In addition, most are associated with a quantitative threshold value and a baseline. 

In regard to species, two birds (common and little tern), one mammal (bottlenose dolphin), one species of turtle (loggerhead) and one species of fish (cunner) have been mentioned in the associated indicators. This choice of species-level targets however does not contain the whole range of biodiversity components, especially regarding fish and seabirds for Slovenian waters. These are all listed/protected species, already covered by other pieces of legislation, which is in line with the definition of GES.  

For indicators associated to habitats, Slovenia mentions a number of benthic habitats which constitute relatively good coverage of the main seabed habitats but do not cover water column habitats. 

Finally, Slovenia also has three operational targets relating to Descriptor 1, including the establishment of protected areas for 10% of the surface of the coast and marine territory and the elimination of uncertainties and gaps in the initial assessment and the setting of objectives and targets for all criteria and indicators. Each of these three operational targets are interim targets but as the achievement deadline is set for 2020, it is therefore unlikely that these are sufficient to achieve GES. ";The Slovenian targets for D1 are considered partially adequate. The targets, along with associated indicators, are SMART. The targets focus on compliance with relevant existing legislation and convention, which means that the species and habitats covered by the targets are listed/protected species already covered by other frameworks. The coverage of the biodiversity components is therefore not comprehensive as not all relevant species are covered and water column habitats have been excluded completely, whereas the coverage of benthic habitats is relatively good. It is unlikely that the targets will be sufficient to achieve GES, which is defined at a more general level, especially for habitats.;"- SMART targets and indicators
- Focus on compliance with existing legislation and agreements
- Not full coverage of all biodiversity components covered in the GES definition";2;Partially adequate
Slovenia;D1;Consistency ;;"The approach for the three biodiversity descriptors is not fully consistent. With regard to Descriptor 1 for both the GES definition and the setting of targets, Slovenia has referred to existing legislation which it has not done for Descriptors 4 and 6. The GES definitions for each of the descriptors have been defined at a high level and generally remain at the criteria level. The GES definitions often set as a baseline “natural conditions” but it is unclear what are considered natural conditions. In addition, it seems that the GES definition for D1 includes only protected/listed habitats and does not address all marine species reported in the initial assessment.

The targets are not comprehensive enough to achieve GES and are not fully consistent with the initial assessment. Slovenia’s option not to report on some species groups/individual species, justified by the fact that they will be covered under the reporting obligations of the Habitats and Birds Directives, did not hinder the establishment of targets covering some of these species groups/individual species (e.g. loggerhead turtle). Still, the choice of species-level targets does not contain the whole range of biodiversity components, especially regarding fish and seabirds, for Slovenian waters.";;;;
Slovenia;D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Slovenia has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor level both in the reporting sheets and in the paper report (the text is very similar but “reduced fertility” is not mentioned in the reporting sheets). None of the criteria or indicators laid out for Descriptor 10 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated and no justification has been provided.

Slovenia acknowledges the need for more information on marine litter and indicates that it is not possible to claim with certainty that GES will be achieved by 2020, stating that a decreasing trend in the amount of waste will be a good indicator of the developments achieved. The baseline used for this assessment is provided in the reporting sheets and consists of the results of the analyses from 2007-2012. It is also indicated that Descriptor 10 is related to Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 and some impacts are listed, including the socio-economic impacts on industry and coastal communities, which are not referred to in the 2010 Commission Decision.";The definition of GES for Descriptor 10 is considered partially adequate.

Slovenia;D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Slovenia has carried out an initial assessment on the level of pressure and the impacts of marine litter in Slovenian marine waters. The assessment focuses on litter found on beaches and in the water column. It is acknowledged that there is insufficient data on litter in the seabed. The information is both qualitative and quantitative. There is a good attempt to provide quantitative information, including the amount of litter found and the percentage of litter of different compositions, usually referring to data gathered in 2007-2012. The information on marine litter in the water column refers to micro-particles in some detail. 

Trends (stable) and judgements (not good) on the current level of pressure caused by marine litter are provided but only for beaches as there is insufficient information on the water column.

Slovenia;D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Slovenia has defined four targets and four associated indicators to address Descriptor 10. In the paper report, the first two targets are referred to as “environmental objectives” and the other two as “operational objectives”. The targets are the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report (the text is very similar) but the indicators are only reported in the reporting sheets (as are the baselines for threshold values for the indicators of Target 10.1).

The first two targets are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound. However, it is not specified what “reducing” means (no thresholds are provided, although baselines are given for Target 10.1) and therefore any reduction will be sufficient to achieve these targets. The other two targets are operational targets and do not address the reduction of pressures or impacts.

Slovenia;D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Slovenia has defined their GES for Descriptor 11 at the criteria level and has applied both Criteria 11.1 and 11.2.  Slovenia has not applied Indicators 11.1.1 or 11.2.1 when defining their GES nor does it have an overall GES descriptor. Both criteria specify that noise distribution and ambient noise should not have significant adverse effects on marine organisms. This ensures that that the conditions of the Descriptor as provided in Annex I of the Commission Decision are covered. 

With regard to Indicator 11.1, the definition applies to high, low and medium frequency noises while the Commission Decision Criteria 11.1 refers to loud, low and mid frequency impulsive sounds. High frequencies are not covered by the Commission Decision and this inclusion by Slovenia results in a significant increase in the scope of Descriptor 11. Furthermore the exclusion of the word loud in the GES definition could potentially increase the scope of the descriptor, however since the concept of loud has not yet been defined this is unlikely to be a problem. Finally no thresholds or reference values have been provided in the GES definition.";The GES definition of Slovenia for D11 is considered as partially adequate. It is based partly on the text of the indicator but has also significantly increased the scope of the descriptor by including the effects of high frequency noises which can be considered out of scope and not practical.  ;"- The GES definition is partly based on the text of the indicator 
- The scope of the descriptor is significantly increased by including the effects of high frequency noises which can be considered out of scope and not practical";2;Partially adequate
Slovenia;D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);The Slovenian initial assessment has judged the level of pressure of impulsive noise as being low. The source of continuous noise has been identified as coming from shipping and Slovenia has reported in detail on noise monitoring at different points in time and at different locations. Based on the outcome of these results, Slovenia estimated that the level of continuous underwater noise in Slovenian waters is high. No thresholds or baselines were reported.  The impacts of marine noise have been described in a general fashion and not specifically relating to the Slovenian situation. ;The initial assessment of Slovenia for underwater noise is considered adequate. Considering the data available for marine noise, Slovenia has provided data from relevant noise measurements and drawn a number of relevant conclusions regarding noise from these observations. ;"- Includes data from relevant noise measurements
- A number of relevant conclusions are made";3;Adequate
Slovenia;D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Slovenia has set three interim operational targets for Descriptor 11. The first target relates to criterion 11.1 but it lacks details as to the types of impulsive sounds that will be considered or the types of regulations that could be implemented.

The following two targets are related to the whole of Descriptor 11. The second target is to plan measures necessary to achieve GES while the third target is to develop methods and an approach to monitor underwater noise. Neither of these targets however commits either to actually monitoring noise or implementing measures. Based on the text of the second target, it can be implied that monitoring will start in 2014. ";The targets for D11 are considered inadequate. The targets lack details such as thresholds and baselines, hence are not measurable, and remain quite noncommittal.

Slovenia;D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"GES is defined only at criteria level. However, the definition is closer to the D2 definition at descriptor level as set by the MSFD Annex I. The main difference is that it does not refer to introduction by human activities. The terms ‘number and magnitude’ relates to ‘abundance’ as set in criteria 2.1. Impacts at the levels of species, habitats and ecosystems covered by indicator 2.2.2 are mentioned. However, it is not specified what is meant by ‘negligible impact’. With regard to criterion 2.2, the paper report indicates that indicator 2.2.1 is not practical, since it demands monitoring that is too extensive and intensive in relation to the expected results. It adds that no such impact has been detected in Slovenian waters.

On the whole, the Slovenian definition reflects criteria 2.1 and 2.2 at a high level. It does not provide any information on specific vectors or NIS. There is no indication of baseline, although it could be inferred that the baseline is the current status.

In the accompanying text in the paper report, Slovenia notes that the introduction of certain species due to human activities is already regulated at EU level in order to assess and minimize their potential impact on aquatic ecosystems, and that the use of certain non-native species in aquaculture has to be authorised in accordance with applicable regulations. It notes that further research is needed for developing indicators, in particular on the impact of invasive NIS. It adds that priority should be given to the definition of the current situation, which is a prerequisite for assessing the extent of impact, but by itself does not provide for the achievement of good environmental status for this descriptor. There are no plans as to how such research should be carried out. ";The GES definition for D2 is assessed as inadequate. The minimum requirements (no further increase of NIS which have an adverse effect on the ecosystem, i.e. no new introductions of NIS, and where possible no further spreading of them) are not clearly reflected. The descriptor is set at criteria level but in a broad and imprecise way. The baseline is not clearly set.;"- GES defined at criteria level but in a very broad and imprecise way
- The minimum requirements are not reflected
- Baseline not clearly set";1;Inadequate
Slovenia;D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Slovenia has provided a list of 16 NIS indicating for all of them the predominant habitat or functional group to which the species belongs or is associated and their means of arrival. It indicates that this number is considered as understated due to the lack of projects and research, in particular the lack of regular monitoring for established non-native organisms, which would allow for the interpretation of basic information on population growth and trends of colonisation. NIS that are established and common in Slovenian waters are listed.

Based on the available data and expert knowledge, it is concluded that non-native species in Slovenian waters do not currently have significant negative impacts on native species and ecosystems. Slovenia notes that there is no information on the potential impacts that these organisms (may) have on biodiversity in Slovenian waters, adding that the available data contain the records of the occurrence of non-native species without detailed data on the ecological and/or biological parameters of these species and that there is no concrete data on the relationship between invasive and native species.

The main pathways/vectors identified are ballast water and aquaculture.

Slovenia is making a judgement on the level of the pressure which is considered as ‘good’, based on available data, and on the trend assessed as ‘stable’, both with a medium level of confidence. This is in relation to criterion 2.1. ";The initial assessment is considered as partially adequate. It appears relatively complete in light of what can be expected for Descriptor 2. Slovenia has provided a list of invasive NIS and information on the level of pressure, as well as a judgement of the status in relation to GES (only for criterion 2.1). There is no assessment of impacts. Slovenia notes knowledge and data gaps but one of the targets aims at establishing on-going monitoring of the most vulnerable areas.;"- List of invasive NIS provided

- Judgement of the status in relation to GES

Slovenia;D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Slovenia has set three interim environmental targets for Descriptor 2. There are no associated indicators. All targets are time-bound with a deadline set at January 2020. 

The first target is an impact target for which limit/threshold should be set later. It is not specific (no indication of specific vectors and pathways, no indication of what are considered as fast actions). The target is too vague to be measurable. It is achievable and quite realistic. 

Slovenia notes that the assessment method should be developed by 2018 in cooperation with other Adriatic countries. It should be noted that this is the only target reported in the paper report on Article 10 for Descriptor 2 when three targets have been reported upon for Descriptor 2 in the reporting sheet and the summary paper report covering Articles 9 and 10.

The second target relates to monitoring of most vulnerable areas for the introduction of NIS. One example of such area is provided – the Koper Port. Apart from this example, the most vulnerable areas are not identified. In the absence of specifications, the target is not measurable. It is achievable and realistic. 

Similarly, the third target is rather vague as it does not specify the type of control to be established and which are the invasive NIS with a high invasive potential. Taking control measures to address further spreading of already established species is difficult to measure without further specifications. For the same reason, in order to be achievable, clear indicators should be defined. While reducing further spreading of already established species should be an overall goal, this is not always feasible and would apply only when possible.";The environmental targets are considered as partially adequate. They are not fully SMART, as in particular they lack specification. There are no associated indicators. The targets are consistent as a set. While the first target aims at controlling the risk of introduction, the third one addresses the invasive NIS already established. The second target is a surveillance target aiming at monitoring risk areas and all taken together are ambitious enough. ;"- Not fully SMART, due notably to lack of specifications
- No associated indicators
- Targets sufficiently ambitious and consistent as a set";2;Partially adequate
Slovenia;D2;Consistency ;;"While the assessment has identified particular species and vectors/pathways, the definition of GES remains very general. The targets also lack specification and could have been more appropriately reported against Article 9, as they mainly reflect the minimum requirements (no new introduction of NIS and where possible no further spreading of them). 

Slovenia recognises that the lack of specifications is linked to knowledge and data gaps and proposes to address these gaps in order to set more detailed targets by 2018. However, while this introduces a certain degree of consistency, the level of details provided in the initial assessment should enable more detailed definition of GES and environmental targets at present.

Slovenia;D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Slovenia has defined Descriptor 3 at the indicator level and has covered all indicators of the Commission Decision with the exception of indicators 3.3.2 and 3.3.4. In relation to indicator 3.3.4 Slovenia has justified the exclusion of this indicator due to a lack of data on the sizes at first sexual maturity (L50).
 
Both the primary and secondary indicators have been applied for criterion 3.1. In order to achieve GES all stocks need to be exploited below Fmsy, at the exploitation rate of E=0.4 for small pelagic species which is a suitable proxy for Fmsy or if these values are not available then the catch biomass ratio needs to be stable or decrease. Criterion 3.1 has been defined in accordance with guidance from the Commission Decision. 

With regard to criterion 3.2 both the primary and secondary indicators have been applied. Indicator 3.2.1 is achieved when the SSB is above the SSBmsy threshold. However, unlike indicator 3.1.1, it does not explicitly state that this applies for all commercial species. The secondary indicator 3.2.2 is achieved when the biomass index for adult specimens for all commercial species is stable or decreasing for data obtained from sampling with trawl nets. This indicator has however not been applied correctly since decreasing biomass indices indicates overexploitation. Additionally, sampling by trawl nets will not be adequate to sample all stocks since not all commercial species are caught using trawling techniques. Furthermore based on the phrasing for these two indicators, it can be understood that Slovenia does not require all stocks to be at a level equal to or above SSBmsy and does not necessarily require all stocks to be at or above SSBpa and is therefore not in line with guidance from the Commission. 

Indicator 3.3.1 has been applied but a definitive threshold has not been set, however this is not a problem as there is still no clear guidance from the Commission on how to apply this indicator. Indicator 3.3.3 has been applied and in order for GES to be achieved, the indicator should remain stable or rising for all commercial fish species. This could be considered a good practice. ";The Slovenian GES is partially adequate. For criterion 3.1 the Slovenian GES requires all stocks with an Fmsy reference point to be exploited below Fmsy or E=0.4 which is an appropriate MSY proxy. This is in line with the Commission Decision. The secondary indicator 3.1.2 has been applied correctly. The Slovenian definition in regard to criterion 3.2 has not been defined in accordance with guidance from the Commission since it is not clear that all commercially exploited species should at least be at or above SSBmsy or SSBpa. The secondary indicator has been applied incorrectly since decreasing biomass indices are an indication of overexploitation. Criterion 3.3 has been applied, which is in accordance with guidance from the Commission and indicator 3.3.3 has to remain stable or increase in order to achieve GES and therefore has a threshold which can be considered a good practice. ;"- All stocks to be exploited at Fmsy or E0.4

Slovenia;D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"In the main text on fisheries, Slovenia has for their initial assessment assessed 12 fish stocks, one elasmobranch and three cephalopods for relative frequency in occurrence %, abundance trends in number of individuals per km2 and biomass trends of these species in kg/km.2  Furthermore in the annexes, Slovenia has provided data for the same parameters as mentioned previously for species sampled independently from fisheries for a significantly larger number of species which presumably are not all species that are commercially exploited. Slovenia however has not assessed the commercial species in relation to F or SSB reference points. No assessment of the current status in relation to GES has been made for commercial fish stocks.

The level and trends of fishing effort and thereby fishing pressure have been described in detail by providing the fishing days, number of vessels and engine power for the various fleets. Additionally, Slovenia has reported the landings of various types of marine organisms such as pelagic and demersal fish, shellfish, crustaceans etc. Lastly, Slovenia has assessed the types of by-catch and discards of Slovenian vessels as monitored for five types of discards.

Slovenia;D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Slovenia has defined four interim targets for Descriptor 3, two of which are pressure reduction targets while two are operational targets. The targets are generally rather vague and in some cases have components that are not fully defined and clearly require further development. 

In regard to the first target it is specified that fishing mortality needs to be reduced in order to achieve sustainable use, however the definition of sustainable is not provided (e.g. PA, MSY) and it is unclear how this target applies to all commercial species. The first target does however include specific recommendations related to the fishing mortality (F) for sole, sardines and anchovy and states that regarding interactions of the fishery, pilchard should be specifically considered. These specific recommendations do not cover the majority of stocks; it can however be assumed that as the third target is specified further, more specific stock recommendations regarding fishing mortality will be provided. 

The second target deals specifically with recreational fisheries. It specifies that it is necessary to prepare an assessment of the impact of recreational fisheries but does not explicitly state that an assessment will take place. This target is therefore rather noncommittal. The final target to develop relevant indicators for Descriptor 3 is useful, although it remains vague and without a defined deadline. ";The Slovenian targets for D3 are considered inadequate. The targets remain quite vague and do not specify whether any or all commercial species will be exploited at Fmsy. The target as it is stated aims for commercial species to be exploited sustainably which could imply either at MSY or Pa levels, although based on the GES definition it could be deduced to be at MSY. Furthermore, the targets still include components that require completion. The positive aspects of the targets are that they explicitly state the necessity for reduction in fishing effort when stocks are overexploited and that a target on recreational fisheries has been included. ;"- Targets vague

In regard to both the GES and targets, it is clear that certain components still require completion as has been indicated by filling in an “x” where a number should be specified. This means that it is not possible to assess whether the setting of targets is consistent with the definition of GES.";;;;
Slovenia;D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Slovenian GES definition for Descriptor 4 has been defined at descriptor and criteria level, although criterion 4.1 from the Commission Decision has not been defined. Due to the exclusion of criterion 4.1 the entire concept of productivity is lacking. Criterion 4.2 has been defined but the threshold LCUT will only be defined in 2018 and can therefore not be fully assessed. 

Criterion 4.3 states that the abundance and distribution of key trophic groups needs to be maintained at levels that prevail under natural conditions, although the definition of natural conditions is not clear. In the threshold value column of the reporting sheets, Slovenia has reported the use of indicator 4.3.1 which at this stage describes the annual geometric mean of mesozooplankton biomass, although an actual threshold or baseline value for this indicator is not provided. In the paper report it is also mentioned that along with mesozooplankton, jellyfish will also be used as an indicator of changes in the food web. In the features column of the reporting sheet in regard to criterion 4.3, the only animal type mentioned are pelagic fish, while other species such as mammals and seabirds could also be relevant especially as indicators of changes in top predators. 

Due to the lack of baselines and thresholds in the current GES definition it is currently not possible to judge the achievement of GES for Descriptor 4.

Criterion 1.7 (ecosystem structure) is addressed only in general terms, and no thresholds or reference values are given, except for the mention of ‘natural conditions’.

Only one of the targets is a state target which aims to achieve good status for, and prevent the deterioration of, indicator 4.3.1.

Slovenia;D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Slovenia has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor and criteria levels in the reporting sheets, but only at descriptor level in the paper report. All criteria and most indicators laid out for Descriptor 5 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated. 

For criterion 5.1, nutrient concentrations, but not ratios are included. For criterion 5.2, chlorophyll is included, with reference to long-term water transparency, but while the description of this criterion refers to harmful algal blooms, the criterion does not include a measure of this, nor of changes in floristic composition. Growth of opportunistic macroalgae is not considered, unless this is monitored as a constituent of the infralittoral macrophytobenthos, using the results of a macroalgal index (applicable where Cystoseira spp. predominates). Just beyond this, in slightly deeper waters where sediment, rather than stone-based substrates exist, a seagrass-based index is used to determine environmental status. For criterion 5.3, dissolved oxygen status is used to define GES in the deepest waters, in conjunction with other water column-based criteria. Quantitative thresholds/reference levels are provided for all relevant criteria discussed above, except for the seagrass index and dissolved oxygen concentrations. However, with regard to the latter, the prevention of hypoxic conditions is referred to, so it seems appropriate that a threshold value of 2 mg/l oxygen is applied.

A national approach is used to define MSFD GES, explaining in detail how the Water Framework Directive normative definitions are incorporated into the assessment. All criteria are employed, together with most (if not all) relevant indicators (5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.3.1, 5.3.2).

Slovenia;D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Slovenia has carried out an initial assessment – qualitative and quantitative – on the level of pressure and impacts of eutrophication in their marine waters. The assessment covers all relevant nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in terms of loads and concentrations, and even includes an assessment of organic loading. The breakdown of total loads into individual source-derived loads is limited, particularly with regard to diffuse source-derived terrestrial loads (agriculture, forestry, urban runoff) and atmospheric deposition. However, considerable effort has been made to describe nutrient loads from urban wastewater treatment plants. Groundwater inputs are not considered and no assessment has been made of transboundary inputs from adjacent marine areas. The assessment fails to adequately cover impacts on macrophytobenthos (bearing in mind the Water Framework Directive coastal water monitoring), but does consider dissolved oxygen status (the impact of which would be most apparent on the zoobenthos community, the status of which is not used as a Descriptor 5 indicator). 

Organic enrichment is considered primarily in terms of particulate (not dissolved) matter and mucus aggregates (presumably phytoplankton-derived and colloidal). Impacts on nutrient levels within the water column are discussed, as is transparency in the light of long-term chlorophyll data. Trends and judgements are provided, as are in some cases, the thresholds used for these judgements. Overall, trophic status is considered to be either improving or stable, with fluctuating nutrient levels recorded over the past three decades (approx.). In general terms, the situation worsened during the 1990s but appears to have improved during the 2000s, albeit with elevated nitrogen levels once again recorded recently. The input load of organic matter is considered stable, as is the status of pelagic habitats, while seabed features are considered to be improving. The proportion of features impacted has not been assessed. There is no explicit reference to the reports or monitoring under the Water Framework Directive.";The initial assessment of Slovenia for eutrophication is assessed as adequate. The assessment includes qualitative and quantitative information on all the relevant nutrients and organic matter in terms of loads and concentrations.

Slovenia;D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Slovenia has defined three environmental targets and several associated indicators to address Descriptor 5. The targets and indicators are basically the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report, although the wording used is not exactly the same.

All targets are generally impact-related, but relatively unspecific if viewed in isolation. However, when viewed in the light of the indicators, they are highly specific. They are all measurable and appear to be achievable/realistic, but no timeframe is provided apart from the overall timeframe of achieving GES by 2020. Indicator 5.3.ii is unusual, since this is relates specifically to monitoring, not addressing impacts or pressures. Even though no threshold appears to have been set, the achievement of Indicator 5.3.ii will allow achievement of Indicator 5.3.i to be assessed and progress in meeting Target 3 to be determined.

The set of targets is considered as sufficiently aiming towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact, or controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved. Target 1 acts as a useful cross-link between the Water Framework Directive GES and MSFD GES, focusing on the achievement of both with regard to nutrient and phytoplankton (chlorophyll) levels, as well as macroalgal community status. Target 2 focuses on the achievement of GES for seagrass meadows, while Target 3 focuses on improving measurement/knowledge and status of the submarine oxygen climate. The targets do not tackle pressures directly but rely on the premise that improvements in environmental status will occur primarily through pressure reduction. On the whole, the targets cover all criteria of the Commission Decision. 

The targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 are consistent as a set. The only conflict that arises is because there is more than one indicator for each target, each one with different thresholds - thus, the achievement of each target would rely on all thresholds for that target being met.";"The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Slovenia for Descriptor 5 is assessed as adequate.

The targets are all impact related, relying on the premise that improvements in environmental status will occur primarily through pressure reduction. They are ambitious and consistent.";"- The targets are specific, measurable and appear to be achievable and realistic
- All targets are impact related
- The set of targets is ambitious and consistent";3;Adequate
Slovenia;D5;Consistency ;;"All criteria are employed in the definition of GES, together with most (if not all) relevant indicators (5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.3.1, 5.3.2). The Water Framework Directive coastal waters phytobenthos monitoring results do not appear to have been included in the impact assessment, and there is also a paucity of data for some water column criteria. However, available data generally appear to have been used for the analysis. The pressures assessment lacks detail with regard to some individual pressures, suggesting that improved monitoring/modelling is required to fill knowledge gaps, but available information appears to have been used.

The targets/indicators appear to cover nutrient levels, chlorophyll, water transparency and perennial seaweeds/seagrasses, although a clear statement of what the Water Framework Directive monitoring involves is required. The same criteria are considered in the initial assessment. Pressures are not considered in the targets, except via the achievement of GES, but the initial assessment appears to cover available data in the assessment of pressures.

The set of targets will probably lead to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts. The targets effectively define GES, the full achievement of which will probably require some pressure reduction. A further breakdown of total pressures and quantification of individual sources of nutrients/organic matter would clarify matters as to appropriate next steps.";;;;
Slovenia;D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Descriptor 6 has been defined at the criterion level for both criterion 6.1 and 6.2. However. the GES definition provided by Slovenia is quite unclear and therefore difficult to interpret. 

Criterion 6.1 consists of two parts, one that deals with damage resulting from the construction in areas of biogenic substrate and the second with abrasion in areas with different substrates. Based on this it can be interpreted that biogenic substrates are only protected from construction and not abrasion. The reference to DNA damage in the second part of the definition of criterion 6.1 might however suggest that biogenic substrates are covered under both parts. The threshold in regard to areas where abrasion and other DNA damage and the loss of natural areas occurs has not yet been defined; the paper report suggests that this will be set in 2018, which might be too late to ensure GES by 2020. It is also not clear what is meant by DNA damage. 

In regard to both criteria 6.1 and 6.2, it is unclear what is considered “natural”. In both cases it should be specified whether this implies some acceptable deviation from pristine. 

Criterion 6.2 states that GES is achieved when it is at a level where various seabed attributes are protected. This use of the word “protection” is however quite vague, since it can imply that these functions should continue to exist, but it could also potentially refer to protection measures rather than the state of the seabed. The second part of the definition of criterion 6.2 referring to the lack of long-term adverse effects implies that the former applies. 

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Slovenia has defined GES almost the same way for criteria 1.4 (habitat distribution), 1.5 (habitat extent) and 1.6 (habitat condition). For criterion 1.4, it has added a condition that “good condition” is related to Descriptor 5 (presumable to the definition of GES for D5). The definition addresses the habitats’ extent and distribution. In the accompanying text, Slovenia specifies which habitats are covered by the GES definition. This includes rocky bottom in the lower intertidal, sediment in the bottom of the left lower intertidal, solid infralittoral and circalittoral, sedimentary bottom infralittoral and circalittoral and habitat types in the water column. Zooplankton is also referred to in the reporting sheet. In addition, a number of features are reported as part of the species but are actually more relevant under habitats. This includes coral rock (Cladocora caespitosa), seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) and Cymodocea nodosa (Pinna nobilis). Slovenia justifies selecting these habitats by stating that the Cymodocea and seagrass are included in the Annexes to the Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean (SPA/BD Protocol) of the Barcelona Convention and coral rock is a type of Mediterranean endemic species which forms large biogenic formation (e.g. facies, reefs), and is a good indicator of status development, in relation to climate change and direct human influences. 

Threshold values have been defined for criteria 1.4 and 1.6 (but not for 1.5) in terms of various indices for soft bottom benthic invertebrates and seagrass meadows (presumably taken from other directives such as the WFD), and states as a baseline that anthropogenic interventions shall be minimal. A threshold value has been defined for density of cunner (fish), which should rather have been reported under species abundance (1.1). Baselines for criterion 1.6 are much more specific than for the other criteria. The baselines focus on various aspects of seabed habitats (seagrasses using leaf length as indicator, and various appropriate multi-metric indices for benthic invertebrates) but do not cover water column habitats.";The GES definition set for Descriptor 6 is considered inadequate. The Descriptor 6 definition is vague and lacks thresholds and measurable baselines. A number of terms would need to be clarified or specified for the definition to be more adequate (e.g. “DNA damage”, “natural”, “long-term”).;"- Coverage of both criteria of the Commission Decision but vague definition with general terms that would need further specification

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate; 2):

Slovenia has carried out a relatively limited initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage - the information is mainly qualitative. Slovenia acknowledges that there is insufficient information available on the extent of the areas affected and the types of changes undergone, reporting that adequate methodology is still under development. In the reporting sheets, the assessment is more focused on pressures, but in the paper report, impacts are also described.
 
Slovenia indicates that the ports, land claim defence and tourism are the main causes of physical loss. The main features affected are listed and the proportion of the features impacted is provided (5-25%). However, no trends or conclusive judgements on the level of physical loss and its impacts are reported. 

In relation to physical damage, Slovenia lists fisheries, tourism and ports as the main causes of the pressure. The main features affected are listed and the proportion of the features impacted is provided (75-100%). However, no trends or conclusive judgements on the level of physical damage and its impacts are reported. The evaluation of hydrographical changes carried out under the Water Framework Directive is briefly mentioned.

Biological features (Partially adequate, 2):

Habitats:
Slovenia has carried out an initial assessment on both seabed and water column habitats. The assessment is mainly qualitative and covers both seabed and water column habitats. Slovenia has reported on the following habitats: shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shallow sublittoral mixed sediment, coastal waters, littoral rock and biogenic reef, littoral sediment and Posidonia oceanica meadows. For each of the habitats reported, the information in the reporting sheets covers the habitat distribution, extension and condition, the main causes of pressure, the status of the habitat in relation to the natural status and the proportion of habitat that is altered. Trends (stable in all cases except littoral rock and biogenic reef and littoral sediment) and judgements on the current status (not good for littoral rock and biogenic reef and littoral sediment, good for shallow sublittoral rock and biogenic reef, shallow sublittoral mixed sediment and Posidonia oceanica meadows, with no conclusive judgement given for coastal waters) are also provided as are the threshold values and baselines used for these assessments.

Slovenia;D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Slovenia has defined eight targets for D6. Four targets are state-targets requiring the achievement of good status. They also require the prevention of the deterioration of the status but without specifying how that might be done. The targets are more like expressions of GES than tools used to help achieve GES. Two targets are research/data collection targets. The remaining two targets relate to the reduction of impacts/pressures. 

None of the targets include a reference to existing legislation and none are sufficiently specific to be SMART except possibly for the last target to reduce the impacts of fishing practices so that 10% of the seabed is protected from mechanical damage. This last target is also the only target that is specifically aiming at reducing the level of impacts from a specific pressure. ";The Slovenian targets are judged as inadequate. The targets for Descriptor 6 lack references to relevant existing legislation and conventions and with the exception of one target are all insufficiently specific to be SMART. Half of the targets are expressions of GES rather than targets. Only one target focuses on pressure reduction.

Slovenia;D6;Consistency ;;"The approach for the three biodiversity descriptors is not fully consistent. With regard to Descriptor 1 for both the GES definition and the setting of targets, Slovenia has referred to existing legislation which it has not done for Descriptors 4 and 6. The GES definitions for each of the descriptors have been defined at a high level and generally remain at the criteria level. The GES definitions often set as a baseline “natural conditions” but it is unclear what are considered natural conditions. In addition, it seems that the GES definition for D1 includes only protected/listed habitats and does not address all marine species reported in the initial assessment.

The targets are not comprehensive enough to achieve GES and are not fully consistent with the initial assessment. Slovenia’s option not to report on some species groups/individual species, justified by the fact that they will be covered under the reporting obligations of the Habitats and Birds Directives, did not hinder the establishment of targets covering some of these species groups/individual species (e.g. loggerhead turtle). Still, the choice of species-level targets does not contain the whole range of biodiversity components, especially regarding fish and seabirds, for Slovenian waters.";;;;

Slovenia;D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Slovenia has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor and criteria level in the reporting sheets but only at descriptor level in the paper report. The coverage of the two criteria is only partial since the definition for criterion 8.2 does not cover acute pollution events and does not include specific biological effects on ecosystem components. 

For criterion 8.1 on concentration of contaminants, Slovenia mentions the three relevant matrices for measurement of concentrations. For concentrations in water, Slovenia refers to the EQS Directive standards, indirectly through the reference to the Decree on the status of surface waters (URL 14/2009), which transposes the WFD, and directly in the reporting sheet field “threshold value”. Hence the limit values used by Slovenia are the EQS for measurements in water. This means that all priority substances should be covered, although Slovenia does not specify this. For concentrations in biota, Slovenia does not refer to the three substances (Hg, HCB, HCBD) for which an EQS has been set in biota.  It refers however to Regulation 1881/2006 on foodstuffs limit values, which only covers species for human consumption and has a different focus than the EQS Directive (human health rather than environmental protection). For sediments, Slovenia mentions that no limit values have been set at EU level yet and therefore it defines a number of possible conditions for the achievement of GES:
-	Synthetic pollutants do not exceed values that can cause irreversible effects on organisms
-	Non-synthetic pollutants do not deviate significantly from the natural values of the environment
-	Non-increasing trend in pollutant concentrations

It is not clear whether all these three conditions must be fulfilled for GES to be achieved, or only one/some of them. The formulation used (“can be”) also makes it unclear whether these conditions are necessary or only optional. Finally, the conditions are phrased only in a qualitative way (“do not deviate significantly”), which is explained by the fact that no standards have been defined at EU level for measurement in sediment. There is also a lack of specificity regarding the baseline to be used to assess whether concentrations in sediments have not increased. 

For criterion 8.2 on effects of contaminants, Slovenia uses the background concentrations and environmental assessment criteria defined by OSPAR (Slovenia does not specify that they are from OSPAR but it is understood from the use of the acronyms BAC and EAC). It is not clear why Slovenia has not used these for the criterion 8.1 for concentrations in biota and sediment but it can be considered covered by their mention under criterion 8.2. The formulation used by Slovenia is unclear. Slovenia mentions knowledge of the BC, the BAC and the EAC and mentions that a “fall below these values means the deterioration of the environment”. However, this is the opposite of what the EAC represent since they are limit values, i.e. values above which concentrations have a negative effect on the environment (including organisms) and therefore which shouldn’t be exceeded. It is assumed that this is an error in the Slovenian text. Criterion 8.2 covers effects of contaminants only from a concentration standpoint, it does not refer to specific biological effects on marine organisms, as defined e.g. in a number of OSPAR EcoQOs. It does refer to “basal activity of biomarkers” but does not specify which biomarkers should be used, nor does it explain what the condition for the achievement of GES is with reference to the biomarkers. It does not cover acute pollution events at all. 

In the accompanying text to the GES definition, Slovenia links Descriptor 8 with a number of other descriptors, in particular D1, D4 and D9, but also D2, D3 and D10. ";The GES definition for D8 by Slovenia is considered partially adequate. Coverage of criterion 8.1 on concentration of contaminants is adequate as Slovenia refers to compliance with the EQS Directive for measurements in water. For biota and sediment, it also refers to the EAC (under Criterion 8.2). Considering that MEDPOL has no criteria of their own, the application of the OSPAR criteria is a reasonable start. However, some assumptions need to be made if the monitored species in the Mediterranean are different from those for which the OSPAR criteria apply. Effects of contaminants seem to be assessed only by looking at contaminant concentrations and it is unclear whether specific biological effects are included. Acute pollution events are not addressed at all. ;"- Adequate coverage of criterion 8.1 on concentration of contaminants

Slovenia;D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Slovenia has carried out a very limited and mainly qualitative assessment on the level of pressure and impacts from synthetic and non-synthetic substances. Slovenia acknowledges a series of serious shortcomings that prevented a more comprehensive assessment. Data are only available for certain groups of pollutants and for some of these only a single measurement was carried out. The information on loads from the different sources is also very scarce. Slovenia states the need to develop an adequate monitoring programme and to work closely with the neighbouring countries in the evaluation of the cross-border effects.

In the reporting sheets and in the paper report, Slovenia has listed the different sources of contamination by synthetic and non-synthetic substances (e.g. shipping activities, industrial and wastewater treatment wastes, agriculture). It provides quantification of input loads but only from land based sources. Little information is reported on both sea-based and air-based sources. 

In terms of substances measured, Slovenia refers to organotin compounds (benzo[a]pyrene and its derivatives), PCBs and dioxins. Slovenia only makes an assessment of contaminant concentrations in species for human consumption, including the blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), sole (Solea solea) and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), with reference to EU Regulations 1881/2006 and 1259/2011. It does not provide an indication of the level of contaminants in marine waters, in relation to the EQS Directive. In terms of quantification, it only mentions that less than 1% of its assessment area is affected by contamination by hazardous substances. It is not certain how it reaches this conclusion. 

Practically no information is provided on the impacts of synthetic substances apart from the indication that general stress has been recorded in Mytillus galloprovincialis along the Slovenian coast due to various pollutants. No trend is provided as only one measurement has ever been performed. No information on the proportion of the area/habitats affected is provided. 

Slovenia makes a judgement on the current level of the pressure in the marine environment in general. It considers that the level of pressure is not acceptable (i.e. status is not good), but only because of the high concentration of TBT (regarding all the other pollutants the status is considered good). Since no indication is provided regarding TBT concentrations anywhere else in the initial assessment, it is not certain how Slovenia reaches this conclusion. In addition, it is not specified what threshold values and baselines have been used to come up with this conclusion and how it refers to the GES definition, largely based on compliance with the EQS Directive. 

In relation to non-synthetic substances, Slovenia indicates that concentrations of metals do not normally exceed the maximum permitted value. It also reports that the concentrations in biota of PAH and metals, resulting from one single measurement, are below the limit values laid down in Regulation 1881/2006. Very little information is reported on the impact of non-synthetic substances on habitats or functional groups – the results from one single study on the occurrence of micronuclei (MN) are mentioned. No trends, judgement or the proportion of the area/habitats affected are provided.

Radionuclides
Slovenia has not reported on radionuclides. Contamination by radionuclides was considered not relevant but no further justification has been provided.

Acute pollution events
Slovenia reports very briefly on acute pollution events, referring to the only ecological disaster that has occurred in their waters in 1983 and to other, smaller, occurrences, which concerned mainly oil spill. Slovenia indicates in addition that in the past 6 years, only minor incidents of pollution have been recorded. Shipping, tourism and industry are listed as the main causes of acute pollution events. There is no reference to the impacts caused by these events. No quantification, trends or judgements are provided and no gaps or future plans are reported.";The initial assessment of Slovenia for contaminants is considered inadequate. The assessment is very limited, referring only to a limited number of sources of contaminants and to a few substances. There is practically no quantifiable information on loads or concentrations of substances or the impacts of these in the environment. In addition, the judgements made all refer to Regulation 1881/2006, which is only relevant for human consumption purposes but is not adequate for environmental protection. Considering the justification provided by Slovenia, it is possible that measurements have not been carried out under the Water Framework Directive, which would explain the lack of values for concentrations of priority substances in water. ;"- Assessment very limited, referring only to a limited number of sources of contaminants and to a few substances

Slovenia;D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Slovenia has set six targets and one associated indicator to cover Descriptor 8. In the paper report, Slovenia has divided the targets into environment targets (including the first three targets) and operational targets (the last three targets). It is not clear what makes the last three targets “operational”. It could be considered that these targets require action to be taken by the Slovenian authorities in order to determine/measure the various elements addressed by the targets (reference conditions for pollutants and heavy metals in sediment; stress biomarkers and other relevant biomarkers; sources of pollution by, and concentrations of, TBT) before they could be used to define GES. 

With regard to the first three targets, they address concentrations of contaminants (including radionuclides) in water, biota and sediment, referring to the relevant European standards (WFD, EQSD and Euratom standards) for water measurements (and possibly for biota measurements for the three substances for which an EQS has been defined in biota, although this is not specified). For sediments, Slovenia acknowledges the lack of reference values by setting an operational target, which aims to define reference or background concentrations for synthetic and non-synthetic substances in sediment. 

The second environmental target refers to biological impacts and requires the values of measured biological impacts to remain stable or decrease. It is not clear which biological impacts the target addresses. The baseline defined by Slovenia is based either on measurements at points less affected (not specified which ones these are exactly) or on the current status at a given time (not specified which this is either). It also mentions that in order to determine BAC, seasonal dynamics of a particular biomarker should be known. 

In addition, two operational targets relate to concentrations of TBT and to biomarkers, requiring that more knowledge is gathered on this two aspects.

It defines a number of “operational” targets, which are actually targets to gather more knowledge on a number of aspects on which data is insufficient (e.g. concentrations in sediments, biomarkers, etc.).

Criterion 9.1 is only partly defined in that the Slovenian definition covers the level of concentrations but not the number of contaminants or frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded. 

With regard to the levels of concentrations, Slovenia defines its GES with reference to EU Regulation 1881/2006 and its amendment 1259/2011. Slovenia does not provide the list of substances covered by the definition, nor the list of species that should be used for the measurements. It is therefore assumed that all substances included in Regulation 1881/2006 are covered by the Slovenian definition and that all fish, fish products and bivalve molluscs included in the Regulation and relevant for Slovenian marine waters are addressed. Slovenia specifies that its definition applies to samples of fish, fish products and bivalve molluscs that are caught in the waters under national jurisdiction.

In the accompanying text, Slovenia mentions the links between D9 and other descriptors, in particular Descriptors 8, 3 and 6. It also mentions the need to coordinate the definition of GES for Descriptor 9 with neighbouring countries, at the level of the subregion. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 9 by Slovenia is considered partially adequate. Slovenia refers to compliance with the relevant pieces of legislation (Regulation 1881/2006 and amendments) and includes a specification that its definition concerns samples coming from its marine waters (origin), which is considered a good practice, but it does not include a condition regarding the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded (indicator 9.1.2), which means that GES is only partially defined. ;"- Compliance with relevant pieces of legislation (Regulation 1881/2006 and amendments) 
- Includes a specification that its definition concerns samples coming from its marine waters (+++)
- No coverage of indicator 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded";2;Partially adequate
Slovenia;D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Slovenia has carried out a limited and mainly qualitative assessment on contaminants in fish and seafood. The assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances is made in combination with the general assessment of contamination by hazardous substances (see D8 section) therefore the assessment of sources of contamination is the same as for D8. 

Slovenia reported on the contamination by synthetic substances, referring to the results of a single measurement for PAHs, PCB and dioxins levels in shellfish (Mytillus galloprovincialis) and the following species of fish: sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), sole (Solea solea) and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus). Slovenia reports that the concentrations in biota of benzo[a]pyrene and its derivatives, and the concentration of PAHs, PCBs and dioxins are lower than those in Regulation 1881/2006/EC and Regulation 1259/2011/EU but no values are provided. While this assessment uses the same standards as the GES definition, Slovenia has not provided a conclusive judgement on the level of contamination in relation to GES (i.e. status is good). Neither trends nor the proportion of the area/habitats affected are provided.

On the contamination by non-synthetic substances, Slovenia reports that the concentrations in biota of metals, resulting from one single measurement, are below the limit values laid down in Regulation 1881/2006, but no actual values are provided. Besides mussels, the following species of fish and crustaceans were used: anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), pilchard (Sardina pilchardus), mackerel (Scomber sp.), Mugil cephalus, sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and praying mantis (Squilla mantis). No trends or the proportion of the area/habitats affected are provided. 

Contamination by radionuclides was considered not relevant but no further justification has been provided.

Microbial pathogens
Slovenia has reported on microbial pathogens. It refers to the Bathing Waters Directive (2006/7/EC) and considers that the levels of microbial pathogens are moderate with stable trend. The level of microbial pathogens in shellfish waters is not reported. Slovenia has made a judgement on the level of the pressure in both bathing and shellfish waters. The trend is considered as stable. The main causes for pressure are wastewater and aquaculture.

Slovenia notes the lack of information on the presence of microbial pathogens in the areas of aquaculture and proposes a number of areas where efforts should focus (detection of changes in the species composition of bacterial communities, development of species-specific primers to detect the targeted microbial pathogens in natural marine water samples). ";The initial assessment of Slovenia for the contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances and microbial pathogens is considered partially adequate. The assessment of contamination by hazardous substances is limited, referring only to a limited number of substances and based only on one measurement. Slovenia reports that the values of the substances measured are below EU standards, but the values as such are not provided. The assessment for microbial pathogens is adequate in the light of the information available. Some information is missing but the knowledge gaps have been identified and albeit vague plans are provided to fill these gaps.;"- Limited assessment (limited number of substances assessed and only one measurement)
- Judgement made in relation to Regulation 1881/2006
- Assessment of contamination of shellfish waters by microbial pathogens";2;Partially adequate
Slovenia;D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Slovenia has defined two targets and two associated indicators to cover Descriptor 9. In the paper report, the second target is qualified as “operational”. 

The first target (and indicator) relates to compliance with the relevant EU foodstuffs regulations. No further specification is provided (i.e. specific substances or species). 

Slovenia has defined a second target, which requires that a certain share of the catch of fish, shellfish and other animals intended for human consumption are inspected (presumably to ensure compliance with Regulation 1881/2006). The wording of the associated indicator is different from that of the target but it is assumed that it actually addresses the same objective. Neither the target nor the indicator provides a value for the share of catch to be inspected. Slovenia specifies in the target itself that this value should be defined in 2014.  This “operational” target is more related to collecting additional data in order to be able to make an assessment of progress towards achieving GES.";The set of targets and indicators defined by Slovenia to cover Descriptor 9 is considered partially adequate. The first target is actually a rewording of the GES definition, requiring compliance with the relevant EU standards. The second target is more original as it relates to the means to assess achievement of GES, i.e. inspections of catches. It does not directly address the reduction of a pressure but acknowledges that it is necessary to have an appropriate share of catches inspected in order to achieve a meaningful GES. However, the actual value is not included in the target or the indicator at this stage, and will only be determined in 2014, making the target unusable thus far. ;"- First target is rewording of GES definition
- Second target relates to the means to assess achievement of GES, i.e. inspections of catches, but lacks threshold values to be SMART";2;Partially adequate
Slovenia;D9;Consistency ;;"The assessment of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption by hazardous substances is relatively consistent with the GES definition as it uses the same standards (EU Regulations 1881/2006 and 1259/2011). As the GES definition and the target on concentrations are very general, they cover the substances covered in the initial assessment however the initial assessment does not cover all the substances included in these pieces of legislation. 

A target has been defined on the share of catches that should be inspected but this aspect has not been addressed in the initial assessment.";;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The GES definition for the Western Mediterranean region has been specified further than for the NEA region in regard to specific habitats: coastal sublittoral rock habitats, marine angiosperm habitats, subtidal soft bottom habitats and sublittoral rock habitats. The first GES condition for these habitats is that their range and extent remain stable except for subtidal soft bottom habitats for which the area impacted by anthropogenic pressures should decrease or stay within a reasonable area. Furthermore for each habitat where possible, GES achievement will be measured by comparing various parameters to comparable habitats that are not affected by anthropogenic pressures. The inclusion of the statement “where possible” indicates that there might be situations where GES cannot be defined. In such case, it is uncertain what will be done. In addition, the parameters that will be used to compare habitats impacted and those not impacted are not clearly defined, which means that it is not certain at which point GES is considered to be achieved. In regards to Posidonia oceanica meadows, criteria from the WFD or the Habitats Directive will also be used. However, it is not certain which criteria will be applied where these standards overlap.

Spain provides information regarding the baselines to be used for the GES definitions. For a number of habitat types, it mentions that the current information available could be used but that a thorough review is needed to complete the missing information (e.g. uncharted areas, standardized criteria). Only for soft bottom communities does Spain refer to the Favourable Reference Value (related to the Favourable Conservation Status of the Habitats Directive) of the JNCC. Spain also mentions that if the habitat is covered by an existing policy (WFD, HD), the reference values of these existing processes should be used. ";The definition of GES for D1 for the Mediterranean marine region is considered adequate for the same reasons as for the NEA marine region, and taking into account that an additional level of effort has been made to define GES for a number of specific habitat types. ;"- GES defined at the level of the criteria and indicator
- GES defined for all criteria of the Commission Decision and almost all indicators
- Quantitative definitions for birds and fish
- More specific definitions for habitats than for the NEA, some quantitative
- No quantitative definitions for mammals and reptiles but sufficient justification
- Reference to relevant agreements/standards (EU, RSC, international)
- Definition at ecosystem level provides holistic definition for the whole descriptor";3;Adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
In the paper report and the reporting sheets, Spain has reported at the levels of the species group and the individual species. It has not used the functional group classification, except for pelagic and demersal fish. The information reported under the species groups is relatively limited but Spain has reported in great details for individual birds, fish and mammal species. In addition, birds (at group level) and mammals (subrogated species were selected) are specifically addressed in separate paper reports in a very comprehensive manner.

For each species group, the individual species are listed and a short assessment on the condition and abundance of the group is provided. The main pressures affecting each group are reported and the information gaps and plans to address them are described. In most cases it is indicated that assessment of status was only, and just in some cases, carried out at species level (but the applicable criteria and indicators are nonetheless mentioned) and not at group level. Trends are also not provided. 

At species level, Spain reported – qualitatively and quantitatively – on the population distribution, size and condition. The main pressures are listed and the information gaps and plans to address them are also provided. The criteria and indicators used for the assessment are indicated and for some individual species trends and status assessment (and the confidence level of the assessment) are also reported. The individual species protected under the Habitats and Birds Directive are indicated.

The number of species from on which Spain has provided information in relation to all the five sub-divisions is very large and therefore these individual species are not listed here.

Habitats
Spain has reported extensively on its seabed habitats but it has not reported on water column habitats. The list of habitats is based on the EUNIS classification but adapted to the regional characteristics of the sub-divisions. In the reporting sheets that have been reported on time, Spain has also reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. In particular for the North subdivision of the NEA, Spain has reported on Littoral Rock, Littoral Sediment, Shallow Sand, Shallow Mud, Lower Bathyal Rock, Upper Bathyal Rock, Shallow Rock, Shallow Coarse Sediment, Shelf Sand, Shelf Mud, Shelf Coarse Sediment, Shelf Rock, Upper Bathyal Sediment, Lower Bathyal Sediment. It seems that Spain has not reported on water column habitats however it has reported on zooplankton and phytoplankton. In relation to Descriptor 6, only the biogenic habitats were considered, namely those included in OSPAR lists and in the Habitats Directive.

Spain refers extensively to the Habitats Directive. In addition, Spain reports on a number of special habitats noting that in certain cases these are protected under the Habitats Directive (e.g. Lagunas in the Levantino-Balear in the Western Mediterranean). However, Spain does not expressly indicate that the habitats listed in the Habitats Directive will be reported according to the timescale and format agreed under that Directive. OSPAR is also widely mentioned, including in relation to the habitats requiring special protection under this agreement (including among others Pennatulacea, sponge aggregations, Lophelia, maerl, coral gardens). The same is done in relation to the Barcelona Convention (including among others Dendropoma petraeum, Astroides caycularys, Corallina elongata, Pholas dactylus, Rissoella verrucosa).  

Where appropriate, the assessment of habitat types addresses both the abiotic (physical, hydrological, chemical) and biotic (community) aspects of each habitat. For each habitat reported, the habitat distribution, extent and condition have been described in (different levels of) detail and the main species associated listed. The information is qualitative and quantitative and numerous literary sources are cited. The criteria (1.4, 1.5 and 1.6) and indicators (1.4.1, 1.5.1, 1.6.1 and 1.6.2) used for the assessment are indicated and, in some cases, baselines and/or threshold values are also provided. However, only in very few cases trend status or definitive judgements assessing the current status are provided (in these cases the level of confidence on the assessment is provided as well). In the majority of the cases where this information is lacking, the justification provided by Spain is that there are currently no reference and/or threshold values GES/no GES. The main pressures are identified for some of the habitats.

Ecosystems
In the reporting sheets and the paper reports Spain has also reported on pelagic ecosystems for both sub-divisions of the North East Atlantic and for the Estrecho y Alboran, in the Western Mediterranean region. The information is mainly qualitative but some parameters are quantified (e.g. biomass for some species). The assessment covers the relevant functional groups, addressing the ecosystem structure and functioning (including productivity of key trophic groups/species, proportion of selected species, and abundance/distributions of key trophic groups/species). Spain indicates which criteria and indicators were used for the assessment and in few cases a trend and status assessment is provided. The information gaps and plans to address them are also reported and the insufficiency of the information on birds is particularly highlighted. Finally, fisheries are indicated as the main cause of pressure in the three sub-divisions reported. 

On the basis of the information reported on habitats, species and ecosystems, Spain has put in place a comprehensive (albeit not systematically quantified) methodology to assess the current in relation to GES (when reference values have been defined for GES). ";The initial assessment by Spain of biological features is considered adequate. It is very comprehensive and covers all major habitat zones (although in a relatively limited fashion for water column habitats) and all main species groups. The information provided is most of the time quantitative and specific and is used as a basis to make an assessment of the current status when reference values for GES have been defined. ;"Features:
- Very comprehensive assessment covering all major habitat types and main species groups
- Detailed qualitative and quantitative information
- Conclusive judgements per reference to GES when GES is available
- Identification of knowledge gaps and plans to address them";3;Adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined a large set of target for the biodiversity descriptors, which cover most but not all aspects of D1, D4 and D6. The targets are the same for all divisions the Spanish marine waters. A number of targets reported by Spain are mentioned as covering D1, 4 or 6 but actually relate more specifically to another descriptor (e.g. D2 or D3) and have therefore been assessed in the relevant sections of this report. But it should be kept in mind that biodiversity is covered by a large number of targets. 

An important number of targets are pressure- or impact-targets. They address specific activities, identified in the initial assessment as causing pressure on ecosystem components. The main pressures addressed by the targets include accidental or unwanted catches, bottom trawling and other anthropogenic activities such as dredging and aquaculture. 

The targets addressing these pressures are relatively general, using terms such as ‘reduce’, ‘maintain’ or ‘strengthen’ and are not further specified through threshold values or baselines. This means that the targets are not measurable. They are realistic and potentially achievable considering that they lack specific thresholds. They are also quite general in the sense that few targets refer to specific features. 

A number of targets relate to existing policies, networks, agreements and only recall the need for their implementation or their strengthening (e.g. Natura 2000, regulations on the commercial exploitation and by-catch of deep elasmobranchs). Another set of targets relate directly to maintain the status of species and habitats (distribution range, size, condition, etc.) These targets are quite general. They are quantified when they relate to specific thresholds described in the GES definition (e.g. Target A.3.5) or to specific indicators (e.g. Target A.3.1).  

A large number of the targets are also knowledge targets to increase knowledge on ecosystems or ecosystem components (e.g. deep sea habitats). ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Spain for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 is considered partially adequate. The targets cover the set of descriptors but lack references to specific methods of implementation and references to target states. The set of targets that relate to the status of species and habitats clearly lack ambition as they all relate to maintaining current status. While the proposed measures for increasing information availability and monitoring activities are commendable, the lack of specification regarding their implementation make it uncertain that they will be sufficient to support achieving GES by 2020. ;"- Large number of targets defined
- Mostly pressure- or impact- targets addressing specific activities
- General terms used e.g. “reduce”, “maintain”
- No thresholds/baselines defined
- Several targets relate to the implementation of existing agreements
- Several targets related to increasing knowledge and monitoring but lack of specific timeline to make them useful to achieve GES";2;Partially adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D1;Consistency ;;"The GES definition for Descriptor 1 has been defined at a high level of detail while the GES definitions for Descriptors 4 and 6 have been kept more succinct. Descriptors 4 and 6 follow more closely the Commission Decision while Descriptor 1 follows rather the structure from the initial assessment. This choice for defining Descriptor 1 according to the structure of the initial assessment has resulted in GES for specific habitats being defined under Descriptor 1 rather than Descriptor 6. 

For the Western Mediterranean a number of specific habitats are included in the GES definition while no specific habitats are mentioned for the North East Atlantic region. For the Canary subdivision Spain has also not adopted a GES definition for fish and invertebrates which is not consistent with the GES for the other regions. It should also be noted that each of the GES definitions allows either implicitly or explicitly for potential future degradation of the ecosystem. Furthermore some of the GES definitions would be more appropriately reported under Article 10 targets. 

The Initial assessment done by Spain is very extensive and reported on pressures and features in great detail. This has led to very specific GES definitions for birds but less so for other ecosystem components such as mammals, fish and habitats.  The state targets defined under Article 10 refer even less to specific ecosystem components and instead remain very general, therefore it does not seem that Spain has made full use of their initial assessment when setting the Artice 10 state and pressure targets. In general Spain has reported in a lot of detail for biodiversity but from the information provided it remains unclear for most ecosystem components (except maybe birds) at which point exactly GES and the targets are achieved.";;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor level. The criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 10 in the Commission Decision are not incorporated. The same GES definition is used for all 5 sub-regions, covering the North East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. 

The GES definition is based on the definition at descriptor level in the Directive. To this, it adds a required reduction over time of marine litter, including its degradation products. A baseline value has been set for seabed litter on the continental shelf only (the state in 2006). For other aspects, where less than 5 years of data is available, a baseline has not been set. 

Spain refers to the work done within the OSPAR ICG-MSFD working group but does not refer specifically to the OSPAR EcoQO on fulmar. Reference to OSPAR is also made for the Mediterranean subregion, no reference is made to UNEP-MAP. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 10 is considered as inadequate. GES is only defined at descriptor level and would benefit from further specification. While numerical reference conditions have been defined in the initial assessment, these are not referred to in the definition of GES meaning that it is uncertain what references Spain will use to assess its GES. ;"- GES defined only at descriptor level
- Lack of specification (e.g. threshold values used in the initial assessment)
- No reference to OSPAR EcoQO on fulmars";1;Inadequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain reports to a similar level of details for all five subdivisions. It should be noted that Spain reported using the reporting sheets only for the North subdivision of the NEA. The information used for the assessment comes mostly from this subdivision but consistency checks have been made with other subdivisions. 

Spain reports substantial data on beach litter, seabed litter and plastic ingestion by marine animals. For beach litter, a differentiation between the type and material of litter is reported. Seasonal averages have been defined for each station as reference levels, thereby taking the seasonal differences in anthropogenic pressures into account. Likewise substantial data on floating litter is reported. Distinction is made between larger macro-litter, having a risk for navigation and smaller macro-litter with risks for turtles, whales and birds. A spatial distribution of floating litter is reported as well. Bottom trawling surveys have resulted in substantial data for the last 5 years. 2006 has been set as the threshold level for targets. A spatial distribution of seabed litter is reported, as well as the types of marine litter found on the seabed.

The ingestion of plastics by marine animals has been extensively assessed (including more than 60,000 individuals of 20 species of fish and elasmobranchs in the North subdivision of the NEA). Macro-litter consumption by fish, demersal elasmobranchs and pelagic fish is found to be accidental and negligible. In the North subdivision, in the period 1990-2010, a total of 69 marine mammals are detected that ingested marine litter. Among the species found, the highest incidence occurred in the common dolphin Delphinus delphis. A list of other species is reported as well. Regarding seabirds, quantitative data is reported for pelicans. Explicit reference to OSPAR or UNEP MAP is not reported. However, the monitoring of beach litter does implicitly link to OSPAR and a number of projects related to marine litter are referred to (e.g. Expedition Med, Pilot Project on Monitoring Marine Beach Litter. 

Spain makes an assessment of cumulative pressures, providing a list of criteria to identify areas that are most at risk (e.g. surface of port areas in a radius of 10 km or tourist population). Spain also makes a quantitative assessment of the current level of contamination by marine litter and a semi-quantitative assessment of impacts on marine life (using quantitative trends).

Spain then provides the reference conditions that should be used for the determination of status explaining that the benchmarks have been defined only for indicators that have sufficient spatial and temporal coverage, i.e. those for which there are series of data covering at least the last five years, and representing the entire assessment area. It then informs that because of the lack of information on many types of marine litter, reference levels could not be determined for a number of indicators. However, Spain does not make an aggregated judgement on the current level of pressure from contamination by marine litter. 

Finally, Spain reports the following needs: the development of a monitoring network, better understanding of the origins of waste and the impacts of waste on the marine environment and an assessment methodology. Reported data has been collected by NGOs or research institutes. Also in Spain, legislation to manage the amounts of waste in the sea does not exist. ";The initial assessment by Spain of marine litter is considered adequate. The available data has been presented and some information gaps are identified. Spain has tried to identify reference conditions to be used for the assessment of current status but has not been able to make an aggregated judgement at this stage. ;"- Qualitative and quantitative assessment made
- Different types of litter reported on
- Spatial distribution of litter
- Reference conditions to be used for assessment of current status provided
- No aggregated judgement made because of lack of data";3;Adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain reports six targets that are specific for marine litter. All six targets are reported for the two subdivisions of the NEA region (North and South). For the two sub-regions of the Western Mediterranean (Levantino-Balear and Estrecho y Alborán), five out of six are reported (B1.9 has not been reported). For the Canary Islands, only three targets out of six are reported (B.1.7, B.1.8 and B.1.9 are not reported). Associated indicators have been identified for all six targets.

In addition to these six targets, Spain has reported that D10 is addressed also through two targets that are not specific to marine litter. One of them relates to wastewater discharges (B.1.1) and covers also the other pollution descriptors (D5, D8 and D9) and the other one relates to impacts of human activities on biodiversity components (C.3.5). 

Out of these eight targets, two aim to increase the knowledge base on marine litter, respectively on their origin and dispersion (B.3.3) and on the impact of human activities on habitats (C.3.5). Two aim to reduce the amount of marine litter generated by both terrestrial and marine sources (B.1.5) and discharged into the marine environment marine through rivers or sewers (B.1.1). There is no information on threshold value and baseline to make these two last targets fully measurable. 

The specific targets on marine litter aim to achieve respectively a reduction of marine litter on the coastline (B1.6) and litter from fisheries (B1.7, B1.8, B1.9). The reduction of litter from fisheries is expressed both as the area (B1.7) and the weight per unit area (B1.8) of litter on the seabed of the continental shelf and as litter from fisheries on beaches (B1.9). While the reduction for beach litter on the beach has been identified for all 5 sub-regions, the target on beach target originating from fisheries is only identified for the two sub-regions of the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast (North and South sub-regions). The targets for sea-bed litter have been identified for the sub-regions of the North East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean, except for the Canary Islands. 

The specific targets are also difficult to measure because of a lack of specificity regarding threshold values. The focus of Spain on the sources of marine litter especially on rivers and from fisheries is considered valuable and could lead to the achievement of GES after further specification of the targets and potential specification of threshold values to the associated indicators. It is for instance not clear how the litter from fisheries is being distinguished from other types of litter. Finally, targets have not been set to reduce impact of marine litter on the marine environment, presumably because of lack of data (which is consistent with the definition of target C.3.5).

The 2012 initial assessment is reported as the baseline. For plastic discharge by rivers, the baseline is reported as the volume of direct and indirect discharge without adequate treatment occurring at present (2012)..";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators covering D10 is considered partially adequate. Spain reports eight targets, out of which six are specific to marine litter (but are not reported consistently for all subregions/subdivisions). The targets are difficult to measure and would benefit from further specification.;"- Targets specific for marine litter focus on reducing input of litter from various sources
- Potentially measurable but lack of threshold values
- No target on the impact of litter on ecosystem components because of lack of data";2;Partially adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D10;Consistency ;;"The assessment of level of and impacts from contamination by marine litter is consistent with the definition of GES as this one is very general and unspecific. However, the reference conditions defined in the initial assessment are not referred to in the GES definition meaning that it is uncertain whether these references should be used to assess GES or not. 

The set of baselines is confusing. In the reporting sheets, Spain sets the status of 2006 as baseline for seabed litter and none other for the other types of marine litter. However, in the IA Spain seems to define reference values for beach litter (by seasonal average). In addition, the 2006 baseline for seabed litter has not been used as baseline for targets on seabed litter. The 2012 assessment has been used as the baseline for targets. This baseline is however not used in the GES definition and none was identified (except for seabed litter) due, according to Spain, to a lack of a long time series (>5 years) and limited spatial coverage. It is unclear why the baseline of 2012 has been chosen for the targets and not the GES and how the baseline of 2006 for seabed litter is reflected in the targets. 

Spain explicitly states that the target serve the purpose of achieving GES. Spain reports one overall target, eight general targets valid for all sub-regions and depending on sub-region, 2-4 sub-region specific targets. Targets address the sources of marine litter, including discharge by rivers and from fisheries and could, when specified further thus effectively contribute to achieving GES. In addition, a set of targets are identified which can be considered as essential boundary conditions, mainly the targets related to the management of marine litter and involvement of stakeholders. ";;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor and criteria levels. The definition is the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report and is applicable to all five sub-divisions. All criteria and indicator laid out for Descriptor 11 in the Commission Decision are incorporated. However, according to Spain, impulsive sounds covering all frequencies (low, medium and high) have to be covered. 

The MSFD only focuses on low-medium impulsive sounds, i.e. only impulsive sounds up to 10 kHz must be taken into account. According to the Spanish definition however, higher sounds should also be assessed (e.g. all high frequency boat sonar (from pleasure boats etc.)) Thus, Spain has, either deliberately or unintentionally, increased the scope of indicator 11.1.1 enormously. In addition, no thresholds or reference values have been provided.";The GES definition of Spain for D11 is assessed as inadequate. Although the Spanish definition is not a mere reproduction of the MSFD, the differences between the two concepts have as a consequence that the Spanish GES definition actually covers a much wider scope of sounds. No thresholds or reference values have been provided.;"- GES defined only descriptor level

Spain (Mediterranean);D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain has carried out an initial assessment on the introduction of energy on the marine environment. The structure and depth of the assessments is very similar for all five sub-divisions and therefore they are analyzed in conjunction. Spain recognizes that there are gaps in knowledge that hinder a more deep assessment but in general, and for all five sub-regions, a lot of detail is provided considering the existing data. In addition, it is acknowledged the need of taking appropriate measures to increase the knowledge on underwater noise and its impacts, such as gathering of systematic information on impacts or the establishment of adequate monitoring programmes.  

The main causes of pressure are indicated but due to the unclear definition of 11.1.1, on certain occasion some sources are listed that do not fall under 11.1.1 category such as for example sand mining, discharges of dredged material. The main species affected are listed and the consequence of the impacts briefly referred to, but again, the lack of knowledge prevents a deeper analysis. No trends or status assessment are made.";The initial assessment of Spain for underwater noise is assessed as adequate considering the existing knowledge on this topic. Furthermore, specific measures are mentioned to address the knowledge gaps.;"- Pressures identified

Spain (Mediterranean);D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined two targets to address Descriptor 11. The targets are identical in the reporting sheets and in the paper report and apply to all five sub-regions (although they have different names depending on the sub-region concerned).

The two targets are unspecific and cannot be traced back to the Commission Decision criteria and indicators. They cannot be considered as sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact, or controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved. The first target is rather an expression of GES than an actual target. They are not ambitious. ";The set of environmental targets defined by Spain for D11 is assessed as inadequate. The targets are unspecific and not related to the indicators of the 2010 Commission Decision.

Spain (Mediterranean);D11;Consistency ;;The assessment of the pressures is consistent with Spain’s definition of GES. The definition of GES is very wide, much wider than in the MSFD, as is the scope of activities causing the pressure that are covered in the initial assessment. The set of targets, however, it is not considered adequate to address the pressures identified in the initial assessment – the targets are unspecific and not ambitious. The targets reported by Spain will not allow the achievement of GES for D11.;;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"GES is determined only at descriptor and criteria level in the same way for all Spanish sub-regions and divisions. The first definition relates to the GES definition at descriptor level but also includes some elements of criteria 2.2. The descriptor definition refers to maintaining biodiversity in general and in relation to habitats and commercial species. On the whole, the current state of biodiversity, habitats, commercial species and fish stocks (initial assessment) is used as a baseline.  The second part of the definition targets more precisely one well studied taxonomic group, the macroalgae, and provides a direct link to the initial assessment by referring to the state of the habitat threatened by this particular invasive NIS. This is a detailed specification of the indicator 2.2.1. 

The second definition focuses on the reduction of the risk of introduction and spread of NIS directly targeting the main vectors of introduction. It primarily details the descriptor definition set in Annex I of the Directive and also relates indirectly to criteria 2.1. The main vectors are not specified in the definition itself. However, these are detailed in the environmental targets (see below). There is no indication on the extent of the required reductionof NIS introductions. Finally considering that the definition does not require no new NIS introductions it does not meet the minimum requirements.";The GES definition for D2 is assessed as partially adequate. GES is defined at descriptor, criteria and indicator level (2.1, 2.2 and 2.1.1). It addresses both the risk of introduction and spreading of invasive NIS and the prevention of the deterioration of the initial state due to pressure by NIS. One type of invasive NIS is specifically mentioned (macro-algae) and the definition is set at indicator level. One of the definitions does not include a baseline or reference conditions but only refers to a minimisation of risks. Since the definition does not require no further introductions of NIS it does not meet the minimum requirements.;"- GES defined at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels
- Addresses both the risk of introduction and spreading, as well as the prevention of the deterioration of the initial state
- One type of invasive NIS is specifically mentioned
- The GES does not meet the minimum requirement of no new NIS introductions";2;Partially adequate 
Spain (Mediterranean);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"For both divisions, there are no reporting sheets available on features and pressures for Article 8(a) and (b). For both divisions, all possible vectors and pathways are extensively described and pressure accumulation is considered to assess the areas at greater risk, based on available studies.

The assessment of NIS present in both Western Mediterranean sub-divisions is succinct. Only a limited number of species are named and described: 
•	In the Levantino-Balear division, Percnon gibbesi, Munida rutlanti and the invasive algae Acrothamnion preissii.
•	In the Estrecho y Alborán division, Percnon gibbesi, Oculina patagonica, Asparagopsis armata, Asparagopsis taxiformis, Caulerpa racemosa, Acanthurus monroviae and Fistularia commersonii.

As for the other divisions, spatial distribution, temporal occurrence and impacts are described in a general manner. There is no judgement on trends.";The assessment is considered to be partially adequate. Spain has analysed existing information, identifying the main NIS present in the sub-region, with particular attention paid to invasive NIS. The pressures are described in details, including the identification of areas at greater risk. However, the information on impacts and level of pressure is scarce and there is no judgement on the general trend. The limitations of the assessment and knowledge gaps are described in details. There are no detailed plans as to how to fill the gaps in the part on the initial assessment, however, one of the environmental targets relates specifically on future studies and monitoring on these aspects (see below).;"- Lack of full inventory 
- Identification of the main NIS with a focus on invasive ones (listed) 
- Pathways of NIS introductions identified
- Identification of areas at greater risk
- Scarce information on impacts and level of pressure
- Knowledge gaps identified, no plans described to address them but one target on future studies and monitoring specific to NIS";2;Partially adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The environmental targets are identical for all five sub-divisions. The three first targets are pressure and impact related targets. In addition, there is one operational target on future studies aiming at addressing knowledge gaps.

The first target is specific, relating to the minimisation of introduction or spreading of NIS. It specifically addresses at least 8 introduction pathways for which avoidance and/or control of introduction should take place. It is not measurable in the current state of knowledge. Whether it is achievable depends on the definition of minimisation, avoidance and control. However, the indicator (number of policy measures) remains rather vague and does not focus on results. The reporting sheet indicates that further development is needed and that the indicator is expected to be operational by 2018 if adopted. The deadline for reaching the target is December 2020.

The level of ambitious depends (along with achievability) on the definition of minimization, avoidance, control. 

The second target is specific (eradication or reduction in the abundance of invasive NIS). Eradication would not be realistic, but the target also focuses on reduction and includes some precautionary wording (whenever technically feasible). It could be measurable if combined with a monitoring network/programme, which would be necessary in order to implement the associated indicator. The indicator consists in the number of invasive species and areas in which eradication or abundance reduction measures are taking place. This is clearly not immediately operational. Similarly to the first target, the reporting sheet indicates that further development is needed in relation to the associated indicator, which is expected to be operational by 2018 if adopted. The deadline is for reaching the target is December 2020.

The target is very ambitious, eradication or reduction of species is difficult and costly. One major question is the condition that ‘no collateral damage is produced’. It is very unlikely that there will be no collateral damage when eradicating or reducing invasive species. This may prevent this target from being effective, hence ambitious.

The third target is specific to marine farming, including farming of non-native species, and aims at preventing impacts on the trophic web. However, it is not clearly measurable in the absence of baseline or reference levels although it could be measured through the number of measures taken to prevent impacts. It is considered as achievable. The associated indicator (to be further developed and be operational by 2018 if adopted) relates to surveillance systems, which suggests that this target will be measured in terms of extent of impacts. The deadline for reaching the target is December 2020. This target is rather ambitious – preventing impact on the tropic web although it depends to which extent the impacts should be prevented.

The fourth target relates to research and monitoring in relation to NIS. It is rather specific if to consider it in combination with all data and knowledge gaps identified in the initial assessment. However, this link is only implicit. It is difficult to measure, in the absence of specifications as to the results to be achieved. The proposed associated indicator refers to the number of studies undertaken and percentage of the division area covered by regular monitoring programmes. Therefore, it is achievable only in relation to the establishment of a monitoring network and coordination at national level while it is not clear which level of knowledge is to be reached. The deadline for reaching the target is December 2020. If to consider that the target aim at addressing the gaps in knowledge identified in the initial assessment, the level of ambition is potentially high although it depends on the extent to which these gaps will be addressed.";The targets set by Spain in relation to Descriptor 2 are considered as a whole partially adequate. All main pressures are specifically covered by the three pressure and impact related targets. The level of ambition varies from one target to another and the fact that indicators need to be further developed before becoming operational leads to some uncertainty.;"- All main pressures specifically covered
- Lack of specification for some proposed targets
- Various level of ambition 
- Uncertainty as some indicators need further development to become operational";2;Partially adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D2;Consistency ;;The assessment of the pressure and its impacts is considered as consistent with the Spanish definition of GES. The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 2 cover all the different pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 2 identified in the initial assessment. While the initial assessment of pressures and impacts is quite general, the environmental targets and associated indicators are rather extensive and cover most possible pressures. The set of environmental targets if properly achieved would be sufficient to achieve GES.;;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Spanish GES has been defined at the criteria level and specifically for criterion 3.1 and 3.2. Criterion 3.3 has not been used to define the Spanish GES. Reference levels will be based on analytical evaluations from ICES for the Atlantic sub-regions and CGPM for the Mediterranean sub-regions and ICCAT for tuna stocks in both sub-regions. The way that Spain has defined criteria 3.1 and 3.2 diverges from the Commission Decision and outcomes of the WG GES workshop on D3 in a number of ways.  

The Spanish GES definition for criterion 3.1 states that at least 50% of stocks need to exploited at or below Fmsy while the Commission Decision requires that 100% of stocks are exploited at Fmsy. Furthermore Spain states that no stocks should be exploited at a level higher than F/Fmsy>1.6 which should ensure that no stocks are exploited above Fpa, it is not certain that this rule would ensure that no stocks are exploited above safe biological limits since there are no defined rules linking MSY to PA levels.

Criterion 3.2 states that 50% of stocks should be at SSBmsy and no stocks should be at SSB/SSBmsy < 0.6. The Descriptor text as provided in Annex 1 of the MSFD however requires that all exploited fish and shellfish stocks are within safe biological limits, which clearly requires that no stocks are below SSBpa levels. This is not ensured by the Spanish GES definition since there are no rules linking MSY and PA levels.

Lastly Spain has not applied criterion 3.3 when defining their GES and has not provided a justification for not doing so. While the Commission acknowledges that no thresholds and baselines can currently be set for this criterion it has been concluded that it should be used by MS.";For criterion 3.1 the level of fishing mortality should be set at Fmsy for all stocks while Spain requires it for 50% of their stocks. Criterion 3.2 should ensure that the SSB of stocks are at least at PA levels, which is not ensured by the Spanish GES conditions. Criterion 3.3 has not been used by Spain to define GES. ;"- The GES requires the achievement of GES for only 50% of the commercially exploited species
- Criterion 3.2 definition insufficient to ensure that no stocks have a SSB outside of safe biological limits
- Criterion 3.3 not applied";1;Inadequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain reports to a similar level of details for all five subdivisions, using the same methodology to make an assessment of the current levels of and impacts from the extraction pressure. The Spanish initial assessment reports in detail on the level of pressure from fisheries and assesses the status of fish stocks using the following methodologies. 

Fishing mortality:
•	F/Fmsy & F(average last analyzed 3 years)/Fmsy, (<=1,0 = best); (>1,0 y <=1,6 = average); (>1,6 = poor)
•	[F(last(analyzed) year - historical time series)]/average historical F & [F(previous 3 years - historical time series)]/average historical F (<=0,0 = best); (>0,0 y <=1,6 = average); (>1,6 = poor)  
•	F(average last analyzed 2 years)/F(average previous 3 years). (>1.2 – poor)

Spawning stock biomass:
•	SSB/SSBmsy & SSB(average previous 3 years)/SSBmsy, (<=1,0 = good); (>1,0 y <=1,6 =average); (>1,6 = poor)
•	[SSB(last year - historical time series)]/average historical SSB & [SSB(last 3 years - historical time series)]/average historical SSB (<=0,0 = good); (>0,0 y <=1,6 = average); (>1,6 = poor)
•	SSB(average last analyzed 2 years)/SSB(average previous 3 years) (>1,2 = poor)

The selection criterion for the stocks to be assessed has been clearly explained in the text and gaps in data and knowledge are identified. 

For the North and South Atlantic and Levantino-Balear sub-regions, more reference values for Fmsy for fish stocks are available than for the Estrecho y Alboran and Canarias sub-regions. In regard to the Canarias sub-region the majority of stocks lack any form of reference points including estimates of historical fishing mortality levels. There are also fewer SSBmsy reference points available than Fmsy reference points and in the case of the Lavantino-balear subdivision there are no SSbmsy reference points at all. For non-fish stocks such as cephalopods there are no MSY reference points defined. 

In general the stock status as estimated using MSY reference points resulted in more stocks being considered in poor condition than when the alternative method relying on previously observed F and SSB levels was used. The discrepancy in the results when using MSY reference points compared to the alternative method relying on time series can partially be explained by the fact that the time series used are quite short. In regards to the Levantino-Balear most stocks are indicated as being exploited at levels higher than Fmsy. For other regions the current situation is less clear due to data gaps and more diverse outcomes with some stocks being exploited at or below Fmsy while other stocks are overexploited. 

Spain has described the fishing fleets in the reporting sheets providing information on vessel tonnage and fishing days. Fishery impacts are not described for all subregions in the reporting sheets but are covered at various levels of detail in the reports analysing human pressures in the subregion. Impacts described are those on by-catch of marine turtles, cetaceans and birds.";The initial assessment of Spain for the pressure of fisheries is assessed as adequate. The assessment covers the most relevant stocks explaining their selection criteria for inclusion and has made a judgement on their status. Gaps in knowledge and data necessary for the assessment of Descriptor 3 are identified. The alternative methodologies provided for assessing the status of data deficient stocks are useful but the outcomes seem less stringent than the methodology relying on MSY reference points and therefore resulted in more stocks being assessed as being at good status. Furthermore Spain has reported on fleets and general impacts of fisheries. ;"- Relevant stocks assessed with judgement of status
- Fleets reported on
- Impacts reported on";3;Adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined 12 targets to address Descriptor 3. The targets are the same for all subdivisions. A number of targets indicated to be relevant for Descriptor 3 are also relevant for biodiversity conservation and are therefore discussed in relation to the biodiversity descriptors. The Spanish targets are generally characterized by a lack of detail but include state, pressure and operational targets. 

The second part of target A3.4 states that commercially exploited species will be maintained within safe biological limits, while target C1.6 states that the management of stocks should be adequate to keep fish stocks within safe biological limits. The threshold for Targets 1.6 and A3.4 is not specified so this target could mean that stocks are at or above SSBpa or that no stock is at SSB/SSBMSY<0.6 as could be understood from the GES definition. The targets do not specifically state the number or percentage of stocks that are exploited within safe biological limits and are therefore not SMART.

Targets A.3.1 and A3.2 are related to criterion 3.3 from the 2010 Commission Decision but this criterion has not been applied to define the Spanish GES. In regard to Target 3.1 it is stated that the size distribution of Teleosts, demersal elasmobranches and benthic fish should remain stable, however for certain stocks it might be desirable for the size distribution to shift towards larger individuals due to past changes. Therefore for this target it might be appropriate to include the condition “or increase.”

Target C3.7 is a target to improve knowledge for species in regard to Descriptor 3 and the relevant indicators. Considering the gaps identified in the initial assessment this is necessary but the target is not SMART. Target A1.9 is a target to ensure adequate surveillance of the marine environment which is an essential part of ensuring that stocks are exploited in accordance with regulations, the target however is not SMART. ";The set of environmental targets is partially adequate as they are not sufficiently specific or state that stocks will be exploited at Fmsy, instead targets seem to focus on exploiting targets at levels at or below Fpa. The targets do require all stocks to be within safe biological limits. The targets as a set do not seem sufficient to fully achieve GES. Not all targets are fully measurable.;"- Targets require all commercially exploited species to be within safe biological limits
- Targets do not clearly aim to exploit stocks at Fmsy, instead the phrasing implies the use of Fpa
- Targets not all fully measurable";2;Partially adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D3;Consistency ;;The Spanish GES and the targets lack ambition to achieve GES by 2020 as it is understood from the Commission Decision and subsequent working group conclusions. The initial assessment has used the GES as defined by Spain to judge the status of Spanish stocks and has been done this in a comprehensive manner with well explained methodologies.  While the GES and initial assessment are specific, the targets lack detail. ;;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 4 at criteria level. The GES definitions are similar for all marine subdivisions. In addition, in the reporting sheets, Spain has reported one additional criterion on populations of birds, for the subdivisions of Canary, Estrecho y Alborán and Levantino-Balear. It is not clear why it has not been reported for the other two subdivisions. 

The definition of GES, which is common to all subdivisions, deviates from the definition of Descriptor 4 as provided in Annex I of the MSFD in a number of ways. In particular text of the Directive states that all elements of marine food webs to the extent they are known occur at normal abundance and diversity while the Spanish definition requires maintenance of the functioning of the food web. The implication of the GES definition as it is formulated by Spain is that the abundance and diversity of food web components can be at lower levels than normal (natural) as long as the trophic web and existing predator-prey relationships are kept. 

The Spanish definition specifically mentions “energy transfers” in its first part. It also addresses specific human activities to be controlled for the achievement of GES (eutrophication, selective extraction of species) in its last part, which is not included in the Commission Decision. 

The definition of criteria 4.1 and 4.3 implies that the current situation is the baseline and threshold to be maintained for the abundance of the main trophic groups, although it is unclear what constitutes the main trophic groups. The definition of criterion 4.2 implies that selected species at the top of food webs should be within safe biological limits but this could potentially allow for degradation in the current status of some of these species. Spain does justify not using indicators 4.2.1 and 4.3.1. Indicator 4.2.1 is considered not appropriate for Spanish waters while indicator 4.3.1 requires further development for it to be used to define GES. In addition, a number of GES definitions for D1 are also relevant for D4 (explained by the strong links across the biodiversity descriptors), in particular the statements on the status of the fish community. ";The definition of GES for D4 is considered inadequate. It is defined in a rather general way and lacks thresholds as well as specification of the ecosystem components addressed, such as “main trophic groups” and their interactions. In addition, the formulation of GES seems to indicate that the abundance and diversity of food web components can be at lower levels than natural conditions as long as the trophic web and existing predator-prey relationships are kept. But Spain indicates that many definitions for D1 are also relevant for D4 and provides a justification for not using all the indicators of the Commission Decision. ;"- GES defined at criteria level
- Different criteria and indicators from Commission Decision 
- Lack of specificity on certain elements
- Limited ambition allowing further degradation";1;Inadequate

Ecosystems
In the reporting sheets and the paper reports Spain has also reported on pelagic ecosystems for both sub-divisions of the North East Atlantic and for the Estrecho y Alboran, in the Western Mediterranean region. The information is mainly qualitative but some parameters are quantified (e.g. biomass for some species). The assessment covers the relevant functional groups, addressing the ecosystem structure and functioning (including productivity of key trophic groups/species, proportion of selected species, and abundance/distributions of key trophic groups/species). Spain indicates which criteria and indicators were used for the assessment and in few cases a trend and status assessment is provided. The information gaps and plans to address them are also reported and the insufficiency of the information on birds is particularly highlighted. Finally, fisheries are indicated as the main cause of pressure in the three sub-divisions reported. 

On the basis of the information reported on habitats, species and ecosystems, Spain has put in place a comprehensive (albeit not systematically quantified) methodology to assess the current in relation to GES (when reference values have been defined for GES). ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The initial assessment by Spain of biological features is considered adequate. It is very comprehensive and covers all major habitat zones (although in a relatively limited fashion for water column habitats) and all main species groups. The information provided is most of the time quantitative and specific and is used as a basis to make an assessment of the current status when reference values for GES have been defined. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

- Very comprehensive assessment covering all major habitat types and main species groups
- Detailed qualitative and quantitative information
- Conclusive judgements per reference to GES when GES is available
- Identification of knowledge gaps and plans to address them";3;Adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Spain has defined a large set of target for the biodiversity descriptors, which cover most but not all aspects of D1, D4 and D6. The targets are the same for all divisions the Spanish marine waters. A number of targets reported by Spain are mentioned as covering D1, 4 or 6 but actually relate more specifically to another descriptor (e.g. D2 or D3) and have therefore been assessed in the relevant sections of this report. But it should be kept in mind that biodiversity is covered by a large number of targets. 

An important number of targets are pressure- or impact-targets. They address specific activities, identified in the initial assessment as causing pressure on ecosystem components. The main pressures addressed by the targets include accidental or unwanted catches, bottom trawling and other anthropogenic activities such as dredging and aquaculture. 

The targets addressing these pressures are relatively general, using terms such as ‘reduce’, ‘maintain’ or ‘strengthen’ and are not further specified through threshold values or baselines. This means that the targets are not measurable. They are realistic and potentially achievable considering that they lack specific thresholds. They are also quite general in the sense that few targets refer to specific features. 

A number of targets relate to existing policies, networks, agreements and only recall the need for their implementation or their strengthening (e.g. Natura 2000, regulations on the commercial exploitation and by-catch of deep elasmobranchs). Another set of targets relate directly to maintain the status of species and habitats (distribution range, size, condition, etc.) These targets are quite general. They are quantified when they relate to specific thresholds described in the GES definition (e.g. Target A.3.5) or to specific indicators (e.g. Target A.3.1).  

A large number of the targets are also knowledge targets to increase knowledge on ecosystems or ecosystem components (e.g. deep sea habitats). ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of targets and indicators defined by Spain for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 is considered partially adequate. The targets cover the set of descriptors but lack references to specific methods of implementation and references to target states. The set of targets that relate to the status of species and habitats clearly lack ambition as they all relate to maintaining current status. While the proposed measures for increasing information availability and monitoring activities are commendable, the lack of specification regarding their implementation make it uncertain that they will be sufficient to support achieving GES by 2020. ";"From Descriptor 1 , 4, 6 assessment:

- Large number of targets defined
- Mostly pressure- or impact- targets addressing specific activities
- General terms used e.g. “reduce”, “maintain”
- No thresholds/baselines defined
- Several targets relate to the implementation of existing agreements
- Several targets related to increasing knowledge and monitoring but lack of specific timeline to make them useful to achieve GES";2;Partially adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D4;Consistency ;;"The GES definition for Descriptor 1 has been defined at a high level of detail while the GES definitions for Descriptors 4 and 6 have been kept more succinct. Descriptors 4 and 6 follow more closely the Commission Decision while Descriptor 1 follows rather the structure from the initial assessment. This choice for defining Descriptor 1 according to the structure of the initial assessment has resulted in GES for specific habitats being defined under Descriptor 1 rather than Descriptor 6. 

For the Western Mediterranean a number of specific habitats are included in the GES definition while no specific habitats are mentioned for the North East Atlantic region. For the Canary subdivision Spain has also not adopted a GES definition for fish and invertebrates which is not consistent with the GES for the other regions. It should also be noted that each of the GES definitions allows either implicitly or explicitly for potential future degradation of the ecosystem. Furthermore some of the GES definitions would be more appropriately reported under Article 10 targets. 

The Initial assessment done by Spain is very extensive and reported on pressures and features in great detail. This has led to very specific GES definitions for birds but less so for other ecosystem components such as mammals, fish and habitats.  The state targets defined under Article 10 refer even less to specific ecosystem components and instead remain very general, therefore it does not seem that Spain has made full use of their initial assessment when setting the Artice 10 state and pressure targets. In general Spain has reported in a lot of detail for biodiversity but from the information provided it remains unclear for most ecosystem components (except maybe birds) at which point exactly GES and the targets are achieved.";;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at criteria and indicator levels both in the reporting sheets and the paper report. The GES definition for eutrophication is similar for the two sub-divisions of the Mediterranean Sea but not exactly the same. The main differences relate to the reference to the Water Framework Directive good ecological status in the Estrecho y Alborán subdivision and not in the Levantino-Balear subdivision. The reason why one definition is more specific than the other is not explained. As the methodology used to establish the GES characteristics is the same for both subdivisions, the assessment of adequacy has been based on the most specific GES definition. But the difference should be noted. All criteria laid out for Descriptor 10 in the Commission Decision are incorporated. 

Spain matches WFD GES normative definitions to MSFD GES and goes one step further in stating that there is no trend of increasing chlorophyll a concentration (or decreases in water transparency) which cannot be explained by hydrological variability. The definition of GES and accompanying text provides details about concentrations/threshold values/ baselines for nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth and dissolved oxygen. However baselines/thresholds for changes in phytobenthic communities and species shifts in floristic composition are not provided.

In addition, a considerable proportion of the analysis and assessments presented have been produced in line with MED POL’s eutrophication strategy. Thus, the approach would be suitable for MSFD assessment purposes, providing issues over the required level of detail and collection of additional indicator-specific data can be addressed. Importantly, however, GES can still be achieved if nutrient levels are above the GES thresholds, providing there are no direct or indirect ecological impacts.";The GES definition of Spain for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition of GES is not just a reformulation of the MSFD. The definition of GES meets the minimum requirements, using the same criteria/indicators for assessment as those set in the Commission Decision, and is matched to WFD normative thresholds for moderate/good ecological status. Baselines/thresholds for changes in phytobenthic communities and species shifts in floristic composition are not provided . GES can still be achieved if nutrient levels are higher than the threshold value, providing there are no (or minimal) direct or indirect environmental impacts. ;"- GES definition covers all the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision

Spain (Mediterranean);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Estrecho y Alboran
Spain has reported on chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations combined in an index (TRIX). It is not clear whether the index results (or the spatial coverage of results) has been disaggregated and reported separately. Information on water transparency phytobenthos and biological community composition (although it is not clear which community) have also been provided, but the level of detail is unclear. Input loads of nitrogen and phosphorus have been reported, but it is not clear what source apportionment underlies these load assessments. Organic loads from wastewater discharges are referred to, but it is not clear whether any assessment of riverine or autochthonous organic loads has been made. Trends are provided on nutrients, direct effects (chlorophyll, transparency and changes in species) and indirect effects (oxygen) for practically all areas assessed. The overall levels of eutrophication impact are considered acceptable by Spain despite 3 of 6 areas being considered problematic in relation to phosphate. 

Levantino-Balear
All relevant nutrients are considered, but input loads are not total nutrients; only dissolved nutrients. No assessment of organic loading is made from any source, despite a 50% reduction in BOD loading being an early objective of UNEP MAP. It is not clear which individual pressures are considered, so it is not clear whether the estimated loads can be regarded as covering all major sources. Information on phytobenthos is not included in the assessment, since data have not been collected/collated on this impact/community. Spain states that the application of the TRIX index is not possible since available data for each indicator varies substantially”. The presumption here is that chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen and nutrients data have either been collected from different locations, at different times or at different (insufficient) frequencies. 

The assessment appears to cover all geographical areas, but excludes an indicator of organic status of marine waters – this would not be necessary if an assessment of oxygen status had been made, but it is not included (at least not for a significant part of the sub-division). Species shifts in floristic composition have also not been assessed. It is not clear whether an assessment has been made on the levels of pressure, but the overall assessment on impacts is that the trophic status is currently ‘good’. ";The initial assessment of Spain for the Mediterranean region with regard to eutrophication is considered partially adequate. While there seems to be limited information in terms of nutrient and organic loads to the sea and not all impacts are adequately covered, there is considerable information – qualitative and quantitative – in relation to most of the relevant indicators. Trends are provided but only for few indicators. The judgement made on the level of eutrophication does not seem to adequately reflect the real situation. Since few indicators have been considered to make this judgement, the precautionary approach suggests that a more cautious judgement would be appropriate, particularly since WFD reference values for Good/Moderate status are exceeded in a number of coastal water bodies.;"- Considerable information on most indicators (qualitative and quantitative)
- More limited information on impacts and loads to the sea
- Trends are provided for only some indicators
- The judgement that GES is achieved does not seem to reflect the real situation";2;Adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has reported four targets to address Descriptor 5 in the North sub-division of the North East Atlantic region and in both sub-divisions of the Mediterranean Sea, but only three of these targets apply for the remaining Spanish sub-divisions i.e. South and Canary in the North East Atlantic. The targets are the same in the paper report and in the reporting sheets and very similar for all sub-divisions.

Target B.1.1 is unspecific with regard to individual pressures (sources of nutrients). It would be easier to measure for point sources than diffuse sources and river loads, but for eutrophication the emphasis should be on reducing pollutant (nutrient and organic) loads, rather than the volume discharged. This places the emphasis on improving wastewater treatment efficiency, and thereby on point sources of pollution. A reduction in pressures is both achievable and realistic as a qualitative target, but no quantification is provided. The target is not time-bound. It is specific with regard to point sources of nutrients/organic matter, and presumably those not targeted under the UWWTD Directive or IPPC legislation, but if GES for Descriptor 5 is already being achieved there is likely to be no emphasis on improving the current situation.

Target B1.3 is clear, but the base/reference values are not specified (although there is a reference to OSPAR for the South sub-division of the North Atlantic). In essence this represents a reduced target for D5, compared to what is specified in the Directive or the 2010 Commission Decision. The target would be specific and measurable once the base/reference values are defined. It appears to be realistic, achievable and time bound. It does not tackle any individual pressures, but rather ‘total’ eutrophication pressures. The target refers only to marine nutrient concentrations; not to direct or indirect impacts of elevated nutrient levels.

Target B1.4 is directly related to the good ecological status of the WFD and as such is directly related to GES. In light of the above targets it is measureable and potentially achievable, but probably not realistic (by 2020 at least). 

Target B3.1 is specific with regard to one pressure, and measurable with regard to its success or failure – it either will or won’t improve quantification of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (in particular), but linking this to increased primary productivity will be more uncertain. The target is not time-bound, and whether it is realistic or achievable remains to be seen.

The targets are not considered to be sufficiently targeted or ambitious towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact, or controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved. The first target is aimed at pressures (point sources), and the second at impacts, but as they are only qualitative, any improvement(s) are likely to be small. The third and the fourth targets (just research) do not address pressures or impacts at all. 

The targets are not complete and not sufficiently specific. The targets are designed to achieve pressure reduction, but predominantly from point sources. The fourth target does not attempt to reduce atmospheric deposition, only to better understand its impact. The indicators of GES are the same as those laid down in the 2010 Commission Decision.";The set of environmental targets defined by Spain for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The targets are only qualitative and therefore they are not considered to be sufficiently targeted or ambitious towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact. In addition, the targets are not consistent, or at least not complete and sufficiently specific.

Spain (Mediterranean);D5;Consistency ;;"Western Mediterranean (Estrecho y Alboran and Levantino-Balear)
The assessment of eutrophication and its impacts is considered consistent with the Spanish definition of GES for both sub-divisions of the Mediterranean, but it is not clear to which extent. Some pressures and some impacts appear not to have been considered, or at least not fully enough, but the definition of GES is clear and ambitious. The assessment of impacts on phytobenthos communities, in particular, appears to be lacking in data. The issue of whether GES can still be ascribed to the relevant areas if nutrient levels are high but eutrophication impacts are considered acceptable remains to be addressed.

In any case, the set of targets defined for Descriptor 5 does not cover all the different pressures and impacts identified in the initial assessment. Individual pressures require further clarification (e.g. river loads, direct coastal discharges atmospheric deposition, and autochthonous loads, vs. point and diffuse sources). The environmental targets avoid land-derived diffuse sources of nutrients. The apportionment of total nutrient/organic loads between individual pressures (sources) may not necessarily have an effect on the impacts observed (e.g. reduced dissolved oxygen concentration), but it could affect the area(s) and feature impacted. In the Mediterranean, phosphorus concentration is the primary driver of phytoplankton levels, so it appear that one of the targets for Descriptor 5 should address the detergent P content issue.

Spain believes that current impacts are at an acceptable level, despite describing some areas as being problematic with regard to nutrient concentrations. When other indicators are also monitored (in addition to those included in the initial assessment), it is possible that additional areas could also be regarded as under the threat of eutrophication. Impacts on phytobenthos communities are essentially unknown. The target for pressure reduction is qualitative, but the thresholds for GES (some at least, e.g. nutrient concentrations) are quantitative. The relative importance of different pressures does not appear to have been fully considered in developing the targets, and for some indicators quantitative targets have not been developed. Therefore, these targets will probably not be sufficient to achieve GES.";;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES at the criteria level and at the indicator level for criterion 6.1 but not for criterion 6.2. The Spanish GES definition states that the distribution area of biogenic and/or protected habitats remains table or increase. The use of “or” in the formulation creates uncertainty whether the distributional range of all biogenic habitats will have to be stable or increasing to achieve GES or only those which are protected. 

Regarding the condition of the habitats, the aim is for them to remain durable and functioning. This does not necessarily require positive or stable trends and could potentially allow for a degradation from the current state, as long as it does not endanger the overall functioning and existence of the associated characteristic and key species. With regard to the impacts of human activities, there is also the possibility for further degradation as long as it does not endanger the maintenance of the benthic habits. Allowing further degradation however is not in conflict with guidance from the 2010 Commission Decision. 

The Spanish GES also refers to benthic habitats, characteristic and key species while not clarifying which specific ecosystem components and which threshold values will be taken into account when assessing GES. For this reason, GES as it is currently defined is not operational and measurable. ";The Spanish GES is partially adequate as it is in line with guidance from the 2010 Commission Decision except for not using the indicators for criterion 6.2. In order for the GES to become operational further elaboration is needed to conclude which values ensure that the durability, functioning and maintenance of the associated characteristic species and key species is maintained and which specific ecosystem components  will be evaluated. ;"- GES definition in line with Commission Decision at criteria level

Pressures (physical loss and damage)  (Adequate; 3):

The main causes of physical loss are identical for both subdivisions and include ports, land claim defences and dredging. It is indicated that physical losses, associated with changes to seabed, are specific to near-shore areas and very little spread. For the Levantino-Balear, it is reported that the extraction of sand varies widely depending on the provinces and the cases of Barcelona and Valencia are specifically mentioned. There is currently one permanent platform for oil extraction and another one is expected for 2012.Trends are provided in relation to discharge of dredged materials (declining) and port dredging (increasing). In relation to the Estrecho y Alborán, it is indicated that the sea is the main destination of discharge dredged material but a general decreasing trend on port dredging is reported. More than 50% of the beaches of this subdivision were reported has having been regenerated.

The main causes of physical damage are identical for the two subdivisions. While fisheries and ports are common to both, in the Levantino-Balear tourism is specifically referred to. In this subdivision it is also indicated that trawling is common in a few provinces, namely Tarragona, Castellon, Valencia and Alicante. The Casablanca platform (2000 barrels a day) is mentioned as an additional cause of physical damage in the Levantino-Balear, but in the Estrecho y Alborán there are no activities for the extraction of hydrocarbons. The number of active dams as well as the average volume of water reserved is indicated for both subdivisions. 

In the reporting sheet Spain only mentioned some trends and did not make a judgement on the level of pressure from both physical loss and physical damage, neither has specifically mentioned the features impacted. On the other hand, in the paper report impacts, mostly resulting from selected fishing activities, are mentioned and some judgements are made.

Biological features (Adequate; 3):

Habitats
Spain has reported extensively on its seabed habitats but it has not reported on water column habitats. The list of habitats is based on the EUNIS classification but adapted to the regional characteristics of the sub-divisions. In the reporting sheets that have been reported on time, Spain has also reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. In particular for the North subdivision of the NEA, Spain has reported on Littoral Rock, Littoral Sediment, Shallow Sand, Shallow Mud, Lower Bathyal Rock, Upper Bathyal Rock, Shallow Rock, Shallow Coarse Sediment, Shelf Sand, Shelf Mud, Shelf Coarse Sediment, Shelf Rock, Upper Bathyal Sediment, Lower Bathyal Sediment. It seems that Spain has not reported on water column habitats however it has reported on zooplankton and phytoplankton. In relation to Descriptor 6, only the biogenic habitats were considered, namely those included in OSPAR lists and in the Habitats Directive.

Spain refers extensively to the Habitats Directive. In addition, Spain reports on a number of special habitats noting that in certain cases these are protected under the Habitats Directive (e.g. Lagunas in the Levantino-Balear in the Western Mediterranean). However, Spain does not expressly indicate that the habitats listed in the Habitats Directive will be reported according to the timescale and format agreed under that Directive. OSPAR is also widely mentioned, including in relation to the habitats requiring special protection under this agreement (including among others Pennatulacea, sponge aggregations, Lophelia, maerl, coral gardens). The same is done in relation to the Barcelona Convention (including among others Dendropoma petraeum, Astroides caycularys, Corallina elongata, Pholas dactylus, Rissoella verrucosa).  

Where appropriate, the assessment of habitat types addresses both the abiotic (physical, hydrological, chemical) and biotic (community) aspects of each habitat. For each habitat reported, the habitat distribution, extent and condition have been described in (different levels of) detail and the main species associated listed. The information is qualitative and quantitative and numerous literary sources are cited. The criteria (1.4, 1.5 and 1.6) and indicators (1.4.1, 1.5.1, 1.6.1 and 1.6.2) used for the assessment are indicated and, in some cases, baselines and/or threshold values are also provided. However, only in very few cases trend status or definitive judgements assessing the current status are provided (in these cases the level of confidence on the assessment is provided as well). In the majority of the cases where this information is lacking, the justification provided by Spain is that there are currently no reference and/or threshold values GES/no GES. The main pressures are identified for some of the habitats.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures:
The initial assessment of the pressures from physical loss and damage in the Mediterranean marine region is considered as adequate.

Spain (Mediterranean);D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Spain has defined a large set of target for the biodiversity descriptors, which cover most but not all aspects of D1, D4 and D6. The targets are the same for all divisions the Spanish marine waters. A number of targets reported by Spain are mentioned as covering D1, 4 or 6 but actually relate more specifically to another descriptor (e.g. D2 or D3) and have therefore been assessed in the relevant sections of this report. But it should be kept in mind that biodiversity is covered by a large number of targets. 

An important number of targets are pressure- or impact-targets. They address specific activities, identified in the initial assessment as causing pressure on ecosystem components. The main pressures addressed by the targets include accidental or unwanted catches, bottom trawling and other anthropogenic activities such as dredging and aquaculture. 

The targets addressing these pressures are relatively general, using terms such as ‘reduce’, ‘maintain’ or ‘strengthen’ and are not further specified through threshold values or baselines. This means that the targets are not measurable. They are realistic and potentially achievable considering that they lack specific thresholds. They are also quite general in the sense that few targets refer to specific features. 

A number of targets relate to existing policies, networks, agreements and only recall the need for their implementation or their strengthening (e.g. Natura 2000, regulations on the commercial exploitation and by-catch of deep elasmobranchs). Another set of targets relate directly to maintain the status of species and habitats (distribution range, size, condition, etc.) These targets are quite general. They are quantified when they relate to specific thresholds described in the GES definition (e.g. Target A.3.5) or to specific indicators (e.g. Target A.3.1).  

A large number of the targets are also knowledge targets to increase knowledge on ecosystems or ecosystem components (e.g. deep sea habitats). ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of targets and indicators defined by Spain for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 is considered partially adequate. The targets cover the set of descriptors but lack references to specific methods of implementation and references to target states. The set of targets that relate to the status of species and habitats clearly lack ambition as they all relate to maintaining current status. While the proposed measures for increasing information availability and monitoring activities are commendable, the lack of specification regarding their implementation make it uncertain that they will be sufficient to support achieving GES by 2020. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

- Large number of targets defined
- Mostly pressure- or impact- targets addressing specific activities
- General terms used e.g. “reduce”, “maintain”
- No thresholds/baselines defined

- Several targets related to increasing knowledge and monitoring but lack of specific timeline to make them useful to achieve GES.";2;Partially adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D6;Consistency ;;"The GES definition for Descriptor 1 has been defined at a high level of detail while the GES definitions for Descriptors 4 and 6 have been kept more succinct. Descriptors 4 and 6 follow more closely the Commission Decision while Descriptor 1 follows rather the structure from the initial assessment. This choice for defining Descriptor 1 according to the structure of the initial assessment has resulted in GES for specific habitats being defined under Descriptor 1 rather than Descriptor 6. 

For the Western Mediterranean a number of specific habitats are included in the GES definition while no specific habitats are mentioned for the North East Atlantic region. For the Canary subdivision Spain has also not adopted a GES definition for fish and invertebrates which is not consistent with the GES for the other regions. It should also be noted that each of the GES definitions allows either implicitly or explicitly for potential future degradation of the ecosystem. Furthermore some of the GES definitions would be more appropriately reported under Article 10 targets. 

The Initial assessment done by Spain is very extensive and reported on pressures and features in great detail. This has led to very specific GES definitions for birds but less so for other ecosystem components such as mammals, fish and habitats.  The state targets defined under Article 10 refer even less to specific ecosystem components and instead remain very general, therefore it does not seem that Spain has made full use of their initial assessment when setting the Artice 10 state and pressure targets. In general Spain has reported in a lot of detail for biodiversity but from the information provided it remains unclear for most ecosystem components (except maybe birds) at which point exactly GES and the targets are achieved.";;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor level. However the definition clearly integrates the two criteria of the Commission Decision on the spatial characterization of alterations and impacts on ecosystem components. The definition is the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report and is applicable to all sub-divisions of the two Spanish marine regions: the North East Atlantic and the Western Mediterranean. 

The definition of GES includes a reference to space, but in a relatively vague way. There is a lack of specificity as to what is meant with “some zones” and “small size”. Habitats and functions potentially impacted are not clearly specified (although mention is made to biogenic and protected habitats). 

OSPAR advice (relevant only for the North East Atlantic marine region) is partially used in relation to parameters, habitats and species but there is no reference to the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters.";The GES definition of Spain for D7 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition could have been more specific, particularly on scale of changes (time and space) and on species/habitats to be considered for assessing GES for this indicator (they are cited in paper reports for the environmental targets). The definition provided is not specific enough to judge when GES is achieved or if it has been maintained. ;"- GES is defined at descriptor level but encompasses both criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision

Spain (Mediterranean);D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain has carried out initial assessments for hydrographical alterations for both sub-divisions of the Mediterranean. The lack of knowledge and the need to optimize the existing monitoring programmes is acknowledged and the usefulness of the results of environmental impact assessments to have a better overview of the problem is mentioned.

The assessments – mainly of qualitative nature – describe separately the hydrographical changes at large scale, at local and intermediate scale, and refer briefly to changes in the functioning of ecosystems, but only for the sub-division Levantino-Balear. Some specific projects and/or activities causing hydrographical changes are indicated. The increase in water temperature is indicated as the main problem for both sub-divisions. The assessments carried out seem to be consistent with UNEP/MAP SoMMCER 2013. Both sub-divisions are considered to be already at GES.";The initial assessment of Spain for hydrographical alterations is assessed as partially adequate.

However, the description of habitats potentially affected by changes is not complete and no trend is provided. The judgement on current status (area at GES) is not supported by sufficient justifications.;"- Good information on pressures and impacts but mainly qualitative
- Limited assessment of the habitats assessed
- The judgement that GES is achieved does not seem to reflect the real situation";2;Partially adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined six environmental targets and five associated indicators to address Descriptor 7.  The targets are the same in reporting sheets and in the paper report and apply to all sub-divisions of the two Spanish marine regions. 

Most of the proposed environmental targets are potentially measurable, achievable and realistic; on the other hand, they are quite general and not time-bound. In addition, they do not provide specific threshold or reference value for the indicators. 

Targets C2.1 and C2.2 address permanent physical changes rather than permanent hydrographical changes. The permanent hydrographical changes addressed under D7 are however often the result of permanent physical changes which makes these targets relevant although not specific to Descriptor 7. Target C2.3 is the only specific pressure target for Descriptor 7 which is to implement mitigation measures to ensure that changes to hydrographical conditions from permanent human induced changes do not endanger the conservation status of habitats. Targets C2.3, C2.4 and C2.5 are targets to ensure that hydrographical changes are considered in the planning stages of various projects affecting the marine environment. The final target is a broad monitoring target for hydrographical changes at a large scale. 

The targets as a set are probably sufficiently ambitious to reduce pressures and impacts to levels that achieve GES (although some are not specific enough: scale, pressure, concerned habitats…). Overall, the targets are consistent as a set and they cover a very wide scope (monitoring, surveillance, information, participation, coordination, EIA).";"The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Spain for D7 is assessed as adequate. The targets provided are quite generic (only target C2.3 is specific to Descriptor 7) and not specific to the various geographical areas. A few targets are related to decreasing pressure levels and subsequently impacts on ecosystem components. Indicators are described, but no threshold value is provided. The targets cover a very wide spectrum; some are not directly related to GES, but if efficiently implemented they can indeed contribute to achieving/maintaining GES (in particular Target C.2.4).";"- Consistent and comprehensive set of targets
- Most of the targets are potentially measurable, achievable and realistic even if quite general and lack thresholds

- Probably sufficiently enough to achieve GES";3;Adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D7;Consistency ;;The assessment of the permanent hydrographical changes and their impacts is consistent with the Spanish definition of GES for D7, but this occurs because the definition of GES is not specific enough. Therefore the judgement that the current status is at GES is actually consistent with GES definition. The environmental targets and associated indicators are very general and cover a very wide scope, which should include all potential pressures (coastal projects). On the other hand, even if potential indicators are listed no values are given. In any case, this set of targets will probably lead to a reduction in the identified pressures and impacts. Finally, considering that all areas are currently at GES, the targets provided for Spain for permanent hydrographical changes are probably sufficient to maintain GES.;;;;
Spain (Mediterranean);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor level for its Mediterranean subdivisions in both the reporting sheets and the paper reports. However the definition at descriptor level incorporates the criteria of the Commission Decision, concentration and effects of contaminants. 

The method and threshold value used for the definition of GES are very similar to those used for the Atlantic subdivisions. A number of things differ however. The main one is that T1 values are not clearly defined for the Mediterranean subdivisions yet. Firstly, T1 reference values are not defined in the section on the GES definition. Secondly, Spain acknowledges that it has adopted transitional values for the initial assessment, and that these values could not be considered definitive considering the lack of knowledge of the ecotoxicological effects associated with the concentrations of substances in the relevant environmental, geographical and marine units. It does not provide any indication on what it will do to adopt definitive reference levels for GES. 

The transitional values adopted for the initial assessment are the same as those used in the Atlantic region but for a more restricted number of substances (only metals, PAHs and organochlorine compounds – PCBs do not appear to be covered). These are OSPAR’s EACs, the American ERLs and the EU foodstuffs reference levels for heavy metals in biota (Regulation 1881/2006).

Spain also defines baseline thresholds in accordance with OSPAR’s BAC for organochlorine contaminants and with MEDPOL’s Background’s Concentrations (BCs) for metals (mercury, cadmium and lead) and PAHs in sediment, fish and biota. BCs are defined as assessment tools intended to represent the concentrations of certain hazardous substances that would be expected in “pristine” or “remote” sites, based on contemporary or historical data.  Spain uses the method defined at UNEP/MAP level to determine the relationship between the BACs and the BCs depending on the matrix used for the measurements. ";The definition of GES for D8 for the Mediterranean marine region is considered partially adequate. GES is defined at criteria level and is specific, detailed and measurable but Spain has not defined GES for indicator 8.2.2 on acute pollution events. Spain has described the methodology to be used to establish that a subdivision is at GES or not. The methodology is based on internationally agreed standards, mainly OSPAR’s EACs and also the American ERLs and the EU food contamination standards. Considering that MEDPOL has no criteria of their own, the application of the OSPAR criteria is a reasonable start. However, some assumptions need to be made if the monitored species in the Mediterranean are different from those for which the OSPAR criteria apply. In any case, the reference levels used for the Mediterranean region are transitional and Spain does not provide any indication/plans on when the values will become definitive in order to be able to measure GES.  ;"- GES defined at criteria level but coverage of criterion 8.2 only partial (no coverage of acute pollution events)

Spain (Mediterranean);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain reports to a similar level of details for all five subdivisions, using the same methodology to make an assessment of the current levels of and impacts from the contamination pressure.

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Spain has made a comprehensive assessment of contamination by synthetic and non-synthetic substances. Contaminants are described in two different places for each marine subdivision: in the paper report on pressures and in the report on Descriptor 8. In the report on pressures, Spain provides a qualitative and quantitative description of contamination by hazardous substances through the angle of accidental/uncontrolled input and voluntary/controlled input.

In the first category, Spain includes accidental spills from ships, riverine inputs, atmospheric depositions and runoffs. In the second category, it includes discharges of liquids (e.g. from industrial sources or wastewater discharges) and solid discharges (e.g. of contaminated sediments from dredging). For each of these sources of contamination, Spain provides a description of the level of contamination, supported by a number of graphs, maps and tables. The lengths of the descriptions vary from one subdivision to another but remain comparable. The substances described include both non-synthetic and synthetic substances. Spain refers to OSPAR and to the Water Framework Directive. Spain also provides a description of the cumulative pressures in various areas of the marine subdivisions. To do this, it has established a list of criteria to determine the areas that are at risk of contamination from different sources (e.g. areas that are less than 500 m from any authorized location for the dumping of dredged material). It then establishes a formula to determine the areas that are most at risk and those least at risk and maps the results.  

In the report on D8, Spain provides its methodology for the assessment of the current level of and impacts from the contamination pressure. Ultimately the methodology is that used for the definition of Good Environmental Status. Spain provides what it considers to be the reference values for the contaminants described in the pressures & impacts reports, to be used for the assessment. As described in the section on GES, the reference values used for the assessment are OSPAR’s EACs and the American ERLs for certain biological effects for both the NEA and the Mediterranean marine regions. These reference values are referred to as T1. The substances assessed include heavy metals (mercury, cadmium, lead), PAHs, PCBs and OCPs. The matrices in which these substances should be measured vary from one division to another. In the North subdivision of the NEA and in the Canary isles, the matrices used are the wild mussels and superficial sediments. In the South subdivision of NEA, only sediments are used for the measurements.  In the two Mediterranean subdivisions, the matrices selected are the mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and the mullet (Mullus barbatus) for biota and superficial sediments. The biological effects measured include EROD, GST, GPx, AChE and SFG. In certain subdivisions (e.g. North of NEA), imposex is also included. The species in which these effects are measured are also listed and vary from one subdivision to another. 

Both OSPAR CEMP and MED POL are referred to in all reports but, logically, OSPAR CEMP is mostly used in the NEA subdivisions while MED POL is extensively referred to for the Mediterranean subdivisions. For both marine regions however the background values used to set the baseline T0 are OPSAR’s background concentrations (BAC). 

Spain then sets to assess the current levels of contamination in the marine waters and the biological effects from this contamination. The assessment is quantitative, using both quantitative trends (spatial and temporal) and actual values. A number of maps illustrate the extent and distribution of the pressure. In OSPAR waters, the 2010 Quality Status Report is often referred to. Spain makes a final, aggregated judgement on the level of and impact from the contamination pressure at the level of the subdivision, using the T0 and T1 reference values (except for Canary, for which no judgement is made). The judgement is based on three criteria: concentrations of contaminants (all contaminants aggregated together), exposure indicators and biological effects (the exposure indicators are not used in the South subdivision of NEA).   

In terms of limitations and knowledge gaps, Spain mentions that the data available for Descriptor 8 is essentially limited to the coastal band (until 20 miles offshore) and therefore that there is a gap regarding the contamination of offshore waters. Spain also mentions that additional substances should be included for environmental monitoring (and therefore for assessment of GES) and additional biological effects should be measured. For the Mediterranean region, Spain acknowledges that one priority is to define background concentrations and reference values specific to the Mediterranean region (inspired by OSPAR but taking into account the specificities of the region and of the marine activities taking place there). In the Mediterranean reports, Spain provides a detailed account of its plans to address the gaps highlighted (spatial and gaps in coverage of substances and biological effects), including coordination among agencies and with neighbouring countries.

Radionuclides
In the reports on pressures, Spain provides a description of contamination by radionuclides. It describes the sources of contamination (e.g. Vandellós II Nuclear Power Plant in Levantino-Balear) and describes the monitoring programmes set up by the Council for Nuclear Safety and provides the results of these measurements for three indices (alpha radiation activity, beta radiation activity and tritium specific activity). Spain also mentions that concentrations of 137Cs have been found to be similar to those from other sampling stations in Europe. Reference is made to the Euratom treaty. 

No assessment of current levels of contamination is made in the D8 reports. No assessment is made of the impacts on ecosystem components. No information is provided on gaps and future plans. 

Acute pollution events
Contamination by acute pollution events is described in the pressures reports in the section on accidental spills. Spain provides a table of the number of collisions and other types of accidents causing spills and maps of where these have been taking place in the subdivisions. It provides a quantitative description of the volumes of the spills and the substances spilled with graphs showing the input loads for various geographical areas from 2005 to 2009 of crude oil, refined petroleum products, coal and coke and chemicals (not clear what these are). 

Spain acknowledges that there is very little information regarding the effects of acute pollution events (accidental oil spills, etc.), which hampers the assessment of its impact on the environment. 

In the D8 reports, Spain makes an assessment of the biological effects caused by oil discharges (corresponding to indicator 8.2.2 of the Commission Decision). After describing the relevant acute pollution events, Spain provides a semi-quantitative assessment of the species impacted. The analysis is limited and non-conclusive with regard to the current status (which is consistent with the lack of GES definition for indicator 8.2.2). ";The initial assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events of the marine waters of Spain is considered adequate. Spain describes the various sources of contamination, assesses contamination by synthetic and non-synthetic substances using internationally recognized standards and assesses biological effects on biota. Its final aggregated judgement on the level of and impact from the contamination pressure in all subdivision (expect Canary) is clearly related to the methodology used to assess GES. Spain refers to both OSPAR and MED POL and acknowledges the gaps in the Mediterranean with regard to background concentrations and reference values. It also acknowledges gaps in the spatial coverage of its assessment and provides limited information on its future plans to address these gaps. ;"- Detailed description of sources of contamination

Spain (Mediterranean);D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined eight targets to cover D8 but only five of them have been defined specifically for D8. Among the other three, one addresses wastewater discharges (B.1.1) and is also linked to the other pollution descriptors D5, D9 and D10 in addition to D8. The second one, B.1.2, relates to wastewater discharges into the sea from vessels and platforms and is also linked to D9 in addition to D8. The last one, C.3.5, is a general target on increasing knowledge on the pollution effects on ecosystem components. It is also linked to Descriptors 1, 6 and 10. 

Each target is associated with an indicator. No threshold values have been defined for the first two targets on wastewater discharges. These are pressure-based targets geared towards reducing discharges from human activities. Baselines however have been defined as the present situation (2012). The two targets, based on reducing trends, can be considered potentially measurable but the lack of threshold value means that it is not possible to determine if they are achievable and to which extent they will help achieve GES. In addition, the second part of Target B.1.1 on improving the efficiency of the various plans is not at all measurable and specific. 

Targets B.2.1, B.2.2 and B.2.3 are directly related to the GES definition. They cover Criterion 8.1 of the Commission Decision (concentration of contaminants in biota and sediments) and the first indicator of Criterion 8.2 (biological effects). For these three targets, Spain mentions that the threshold values and baselines for these targets are those defined for GES. It can be assumed that all the other parameters for these targets are the same as those described for the GES definition. As such the targets are specific and measurable. The achievement of the target would definitely lead to GES considering that the targets are rather an expression of GES than designed to assess progress to GES.  

In addition, Target B.2.4 covers the second indicator of Criterion 8.2 on acute pollution events. The target is very close to the OSPAR-defined target for acute pollution events. No threshold or baseline have been defined for this target which is as such not very specific or measurable. 

Thresholds and baselines have not been defined for the last two targets on increasing knowledge but this is not as important as for other targets considering that these targets are not really operational.";The set of targets and associated indicators defined by Spain to cover Descriptor 8 is considered as partially adequate. All targets are potentially measurable and are associated with specific indicators. However, only three of them are quantified through the definition of threshold values and baselines but they are rather an expression of GES than targets designed to assess progress to GES. The other targets are quite generic and without threshold values.  ;"- Targets are potentially measurable and have associated indicators

Spain (Mediterranean);D8;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the level of and impacts from the contamination pressure is consistent with the definition of GES. The judgements made on the current status use the same reference levels and background concentrations as those referred to in the GES definition. No final assessment has been made on contamination of radionuclides and acute pollution events, which is reflected in the lack of GES characteristics for these two aspects.

The set of targets and indicators is also consistent with the initial assessment considering that it is quite general and does not cover specific pressures or substances. However the knowledge targets are not really related to the gaps identified in the initial assessment on the lack of information on offshore areas.

However the definition integrates Criterion 9.1 and addresses both indicators (9.1.1 on the levels of contaminants and number of contaminants that have exceeded the maximum regulatory levels and 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded). 

The method defined by Spain for the definition of the Good Environmental Status (GES) is described thoroughly in the definition itself, reported above, and further specified in the accompanying text. The application of integration levels originates from the recommendation by the Task Group report on Descriptor 9 (Swartenbroux et al., 2010), which acknowledges that the “one out, all out” rule may not apply in the case of contaminants in fish and seafood. 

Threshold values are clearly defined (VU1a, VU1b, VU2 and VU3). Baselines are also defined and this is where Spain specifies that the reference levels for the definition of GES are those defined in Regulation 1881/2006 (and its relevant amendments). Spain discusses the special case of seaweed, regulated through Regulation 629/2008, and the necessity to adapt the maximum level of cadmium to account for the fact that cadmium is naturally accumulating in seaweed. 

Spain does not provide an exhaustive list of species and substances covered by the GES. 

The substances are presumably all those addressed by Regulation 1881/2006. In addition, considering the strong link between the definition of the GES and the initial assessment, it is considered that the substances covered by the GES definition are at least those addressed by the IA. For all subdivisions, the following substances have been assessed: heavy metals (Cd, Hg and Pb), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BaP and S4HAPs) and organohalogen compounds (dioxins, DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs). 

As for the species, considering the strong link between the definition of the GES and the initial assessment, it is considered that the species covered by GES are at least those addressed by the IA and should cover at least the following groups: fish, crustaceans, shellfish and cephalopods. The species and number of species assessed vary from one subdivision to another (with a maximum number of species in the North East Atlantic northern subdivision to a minimum number of species in the Canary subdivision). 

Spain notes a number of limitations which hinder the assessment of current status and would need to be addressed in order to assess GES by 2020. These include:
-	Number of pollutants evaluated (there is no information of all legislated pollutants)
-	Current levels (most data refer to samples the years 2001-2005)
-	Total number of species for human consumption 
-	Catch areas demarcation (no detailed information on fisheries / specific sampling stations within the river) 
However, Spain does not present plans to address these knowledge and data gaps. ";The definition of GES for D9 for its marine waters is considered adequate. GES is defined at criteria level and is specific, detailed and measurable. Spain has described the methodology to be used to establish that a subdivision is at GES or not. The methodology is based on compliance with Regulation 1881/2006.  ;"- GES is defined at criteria level

Spain (Mediterranean);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"It should be noted that Spain has not reported in the reporting sheets on the contamination of fish and seafood for its Mediterranean subdivisions. The information assessed comes from the paper report. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Spain provides an assessment of contamination of fish and shellfish by hazardous substances for the two marine subdivisions it has defined in this marine subregion (Levantino-Balear and Estrecho y Alborán). For both subdivisions, Spain refers to the monitoring activities regularly undertaken for MEDPOL as providing the necessary data to make this assessment. 

The assessment, as for the NEA region, has been done for the following substances: heavy metals (Cd, Hg and Pb), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BaP and S4HAPs) and organohalogen compounds (dioxins, DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs). The species assessed are different however. In the Estrecho y Alborán subdivision, the assessment has been done only for wild mussels and red mullet. The data for both species dates back to 2004-2008. In the Levantino-Balear subdivision, the species assessed are much more numerous (closer to the number assessed for the North subdivision of the NEA). They include 17 species of fish, 3 species of cephalopods, 1 species of shellfish and 2 species of crustaceans. The date used for the initial assessment is however quite dated as the majority of data for heavy metals dates back to 2001-2002. For PAHs and organic coumpounds, the data is from 2004-2008.

In terms of judgement, as for the NEA region, Spain does not make an aggregated judgement on the current concentrations of contaminants in fish and seafood because of the lack of data on many commercial species. It provides individual assessments for various species or groups of species (e.g. in Levantino-Balear, 0% of the three species of cephalopods studied exceeded the reference values for Cd, Hg and Pb but 59% of the 17 fish species studied exceeded Hg reference levels; in Estrecho y Alborán, the concentrations of heavy metals in the red mullet are below the reference levels while the concentrations for NDL-PCBs exceed the reference levels). 

In terms of knowledge and data gaps, Spain highlights that the current monitoring programme under MEDPOL only looks at six substances in two species and that there is therefore a need to increase its scope to include at least the two additional types of substances required under EU legislation (dioxins and DL-PCBs) and more commercial species. In addition, there is a need to increase the traceability of fishery products in order to properly assess the contamination levels in clearly delineated assessment areas. Finally, there is a need for harmonization of assessment rules at EU level for D9. As for the NEA region, it highlights the spatial gaps in data (limited to coastal areas). The plans proposed to address these gaps are generally quite vague, mostly related to coordination with neighbouring countries or within the MED POL programme but lack clear deadlines and assignment of responsibility. 

Microbial pathogens
The assessment of microbial pathogens for the Western Mediterranean subregion is the same as for the Atlantic (North and South) divisions. ";The initial assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances and microbial pathogens of the Mediterranean region of Spain is considered adequate.  Spain has put in place a sound methodology for the assessment of current concentration levels on fish and seafood directly related to its methodology for the definition of GES. It does not make a clear, aggregated, judgement on the current situation in relation to GES but illustrates it for individual species and substances with graphs. It acknowledges the knowledge and data gaps (in particular with regard to spatial coverage) and proposes limited plans to address these. ;"- Quantitative assessment for man-made substances and heavy metals in a large number of species

Spain (Mediterranean);D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined four targets and associated indicators to cover D9. Only two however are specific for D9 as the first target, on wastewater discharges has been defined to cover all pollution descriptors (D5, D8, D9 and D10) and the second target, on wastewater discharges from vessels and platforms, is said to cover both D8 and D9. 

No threshold values have been defined for the first two targets on wastewater discharges. These are pressure-based targets geared towards reducing discharges from human activities. Baselines for these two targets have been defined as the present situation (2012). The two targets, based on reducing trends, can be considered potentially measurable but the lack of threshold value means that it is not possible to determine if they are achievable and to which extent they will help achieve GES. In addition, the second part of Target B.1.1 on improving the efficiency of the various plans is neither measurable nor specific. 

Target B.2.5 is directly related to the GES definition for Descriptor 9. It addresses only part of criterion 9.1 however, level of contaminants, and does not address the frequency of levels being exceeded. It is not clear how the target relates to the 3-level aggregation methodology put in place by Spain for D9. Defined as it is, the target seems to apply a “all in, all out” rule (“no exceedance of regulatory levels”) but it does refer to the methodology set up for the definition of GES for its threshold value and baseline. The target also refers to “other requirements for the protection of human health” but it is not clear what this refers to, especially considering that only Regulation 1881/2006 (and amendments) is considered for the GES definition and the initial assessment. The target seems very general and not corresponding to the complex methodology put in place by Spain to define GES for D9. The achievement of the target would definitely lead to GES considering that it is more ambitious (no deviation from reference levels). 

The last target is directly linked to data and knowledge gaps identified in the IA and the definition of GES. It is specific and measurable but no threshold value or baseline has been defined, which makes it less useful. The objective of the target is to collect information currently missing on the origin of fisheries product in order to be able to integrate such parameter into the definition of GES. The target therefore is not geared towards achieving GES but rather improving upon it. ";The set of target and indicator defined by Spain to cover Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. All targets are potentially measurable and are associated with specific indicators. There is a lack of consistency between Target B.2.5 and the GES definition. The other targets are quite generic and without threshold values, which would have helped to monitor their achievement. ;"- Potentially measurable
- Lack of threshold values/baselines 
- Lack of consistency between target B.2.5 and GES definition
- Target to improve traceability";2;Partially adequate
Spain (Mediterranean);D9;Consistency ;;"There is very strong consistency between the assessment of the current level of contamination of fish and seafood and the definition of GES. The initial assessment reflects the relevant substances covered by EU legislation and, depending on the subdivision the relevant, species covering the four main groups included in the GES definition (fish, shellfish, crustaceans, cephalopods).

The two environment targets defined specifically for D9 are consistent with the initial assessment in the sense that they cover the relevant legislation and presumably the same substances and species. The last target also relates to the issue of traceability, which has been highlighted has an important issue for all subdivisions. The first two targets are consistent with the initial assessment to the extent that the IA mentions the issue of wastewater from urban and industrial areas. 

As explained in the assessment of adequacy of the targets, Target B.2.5 is inconsistent with the GES definition. The rest of the targets are quite generic and therefore it is not possible to assess whether they will be sufficient to achieve GES. ";;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast

Spain has chosen to define GES for Descriptor 1 for each type of biological features: species (marine mammals, reptiles, birds and fish & cephalopods), habitats and ecosystem. For each type, Spain has defined a number of GES parameters/characteristics which cover the relevant criteria/indicators of the Commission Decision. GES is not defined at the level of the descriptor and it seems that Spain has not defined an aggregation method to determine GES at the level of the descriptor (i.e. including all biodiversity components together).  GES does not address all components in a holistic manner. Spain does provide a definition at the level of the ecosystem but also uses specific indicators (see below) for the definition of GES at this level.For each feature type, Spain has provided some indication of the main limitations and gaps in knowledge. For certain types, it has also provided a justification regarding the lack of quantification. 

Species and functional groups
Spain uses the functional group classification for certain types but not for all (e.g. demersal fish, elasmobranch). 

Spain does not mention many protected or listed species. It mentions the IUCN list of globally threatened species in relation to a number of bird species included in the GES definition for birds. In the GES definitions for species, Spain does not refer to the Habitats or Birds Directives. However, it does refer to a number of Areas for the Conservation of Birds (or Important Birds Area – IBA), which have been identified by a LIFE project and would be part of the Natura 2000 network of Special Protected Areas for Birds, as per the Birds Directive. 

For mammals, Spain has defined its criteria in reference to the work of OSPAR and the workshop on approaches to determine GES for biodiversity. However, it notes a number of issues with the implementation of the OSPAR-defined criteria and therefore proposes its own criteria. These cover the three criteria and six indicators of the Commission Decision. In terms of the species covered by the GES definition, considering the strong links between the establishment of GES characteristics and the initial assessment, it is could be assumed that the species covered by the GES definition are at least those assessed under the current exercise (bottlenose dolphin, porpoise, common dolphin, Cuvier’s beaked whale, pilot whale (Mediterranean), orca (South subdivision of NEA), sperm whale, striped dolphin (Levantino-Balear), Risso’s dolphin (Levantino-Balear), short-finned pilot whale (Canary) and fin whale (NEA)). By default, however, it is considered that the GES definition covers all mammals (which is consistent with what is reported in the reporting sheet). 

It seems that no quantitative threshold values have been determined for the GES definition for mammals. This is difficult to fully assess considering that Spain often provides details of its methodology to assess GES together with its methodology to carry out the initial assessment. Since the latter is very long and complex in the paper report, it is not possible to guarantee, within the scope of this present exercise, that all elements have been fully assessed. However, Spain provides a justification for providing a qualitative GES definition for mammals, which seems to support the idea that no threshold values have been determined. Spain justifies that for this species group, there is a lack of homogeneous quantitative spatial and temporal information. In the reporting sheet, it does not provide any plans to address these gaps. In the paper report, Spain describes the various activities and projects that relate to the monitoring of marine mammals and acknowledges the variability of the data obtained. It mentions that there is a need to ensure funding to undertake coordinating activities are interregional and international level but does not provide more detailed information. 

In terms of baselines, Spain provides, in the paper report and two of the GES reporting sheets (Estrecho y Alborán and Levantino-Balear), a detailed justification for its use of the current status as a baseline for criteria 1.1 and 1.2 despite OSPAR’s recommendations to use historical values. The justification is based on the lack of historical information at the level of the population as a whole and the fact that considering the level of pressures (including climate change) and current uses of the marine environment, it is unlikely that population distribution and size could be restored to historical level as the capacity of the ecosystem may have been reduced. 

Finally, for population condition (criterion 1.3), Spain refers to the indicator of cetaceans by-catch mortality, recognised as the largest threat to many cetaceans worldwide, which has been developed by the work of various international organisations, including the IWC and ASCOBANS. Spain refers to OSPAR’s EcoQO on catches of porpoise, developed specifically for the North Sea, which states that “annual catch levels should be reduced below 1.7% of the best estimate of the population”. It is not clear whether Spain adopts this quantitative threshold value for criterion 1.3 for porpoise. 

For reptiles, the GES parameters cover all relevant Commission Decision criteria but are not very specific or measurable. As for mammals, it seems that no quantitative thresholds or baselines have been defined. Spain justifies this with the scarcity of homogeneous quantitative spatial and temporal information. It also mentions that the reptile functional group is characterized by a high mobility, so its distributional pattern exceeds the boundaries of the marine subdivision. Meanwhile the population estimates are scarce at the moment, and offer a high level of uncertainty. However, Spain mentions that all species included in this group are protected by the Habitats Directive and the ACCOBAMS Agreement. The initial assessment only covered sea turtles and according to the reporting sheets, this is also the only species covered by the GES definition for reptiles. 

For fish, invertebrates and mobile demersal species, the GES parameters cover all relevant Commission Decision criteria and indicators. However, the GES definition seems to address only demersal fish species and coverage of the pelagic community is missing. Contrary to mammals and reptiles, the GES definition for fish is much more quantitative and includes specific threshold values. A baseline is specified only for criterion 1.3 on population condition (as the current status). It could be assumed that the same baseline is used for the other two criteria but it is not clear from the paper report or the reporting sheets. Spain however mentions that the threshold values defined for fish might be reviewed if:
-	Knowledge of the species studied increases
-	Progress is made within international fora (OSPAR, EU, ICES) on the study and definition of reference conditions 
-	Knowledge of the existing pressure-state relationships, and their interactions with human activities, is improved

For birds, as for fish, Spain has defined GES quantitatively and with parameters that cover all the Commission Decision criteria and indicators relevant for species (except indicator 1.1.2 on distributional pattern which Spain acknowledges cannot be defined because of a lack of quantifiable parameters). Each indicator of the Commission Decision is further specified by Spain, with detailed threshold values and information regarding which types of species are covered by the definition (mostly procellariiformes and charadriiformes and pelecaniformes for criterion 1.2). Threshold values are defined on the basis of time series values, on values set by other directives or agreements or on statistically fixed values. In some cases, Spain also proposes to use values from other regions/species when no local values have been defined. For indicator 1.1.1, the baseline is defined as the current status in the reporting sheets. Spain also defines GES for criterion 1.7, presumably so that it contributes to the overall definition for the ecosystem level. It should be noted that this is not done for the other species however (but fish are covered in the specific definitions for the ecosystem level – see section on ecosystem). Spain makes reference to Important Bird Areas (IBA), candidate protected areas under the Birds Directive. 

Habitats
The GES definitions for habitats are much less specific and detailed than those for the species for the North East Atlantic marine region (they are more specific for the Mediterranean – see section below). They do however cover the three criteria that are relevant for habitats in the Commission Decision (1.4, 1.5 and 1.6). Criterion 1.6 in particular is defined at indicator level. The definitions however are purely qualitative. Spain justifies the lack of quantification by mentioning the limited spatial and temporal data available and lack of defined methodologies. 

Spain explains that it cannot define its GES as being in line with ‘the reference level’ (or Favourable Reference Value, as defined by the JNCC, and related to the Favourable Conservation Status of the Habitats Directive). It justifies this by stating that it would not be realistic to expect a GES at this level considering a number of factors (e.g. irreversible loss of habitat, high social costs, long timescale for the recovery process, etc.). In addition, Spain introduces the concepts of ecosystem approach and sustainable use of the seas to justify deviation from the reference level.  This is in fact in line with the objective of the Habitats Directive, which allows for sustainable use and integrates the principle of “reference condition plus acceptable deviation”. It therefore proposes a stable (in relation to the current status) or increasing trend towards this reference level. However, Spain mentions that in case the habitat is subject to reference levels under another policy (e.g. the WFD or the Habitats Directive), these reference levels should be maintained to achieve GES. This is rather confusing considering that both the WFD and the Habitats Directive (as mentioned above) use the concept of “reference condition plus acceptable deviation” to define GEcS and Favourable Conservation Status.

In the paper report, it is not specified which habitats are covered by the GES definition. In the reporting sheet, Spain reports that it covers only seabed habitats which would mean that water column habitats are not at all covered by the GES definitions for D1. However, for the North subdivision, Spain provides a GES definition in relation to the structure of the planktonic community, which can be considered to be one indicator of the status of the water column. It is not clear why such indicator has not been used for the other subdivisions. 

Ecosystems
At ecosystem level, Spain has one general definition which stipulates that ecosystem structure and function remain consistent with prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions (which are specified as maintained diversity of species and habitats and complexity of trophic levels). It is not clear what the term “maintain” refers to. Presumably it refers to the current status. 

In addition to this qualitative definition, Spain has provided three quantitative expressions of GES: two for fish and one for birds (reported under the “birds” section). The indicators for fish reflect the status of fish communities (average maximum size and conservation status of fish). The indicator for the bird community is based on the IBA criteria (presumably in line with the BHD). Two out of three indicators have numerical threshold values attached to them (CSF and IBA) and the last one if trend-based. A baseline is defined only for the two fish indicators. For the IBA indicator, no baseline is defined but presumably it is the current status. 

Finally, it should be mentioned that Spain has defined an additional indicator/criterion for the definition of GES at ecosystem level for the North subdivision of the NEA marine region only (not reproduced for any other subdivisions). This indicator relates to the structure of the planktonic community.

Canary Islands

Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 1 for the Canary subdivision very similarly to the definition for the North and South subdivisions. The only groups that are not covered are fish and invertebrates. Spain justifies that it does not have enough time series data to make a proper assessment and in the absence of an initial assessment, cannot define GES characteristics. ";The definition of GES for D1 for the North East Atlantic marine region is considered adequate.  Spain has defined GES for almost all relevant feature types (but not consistently for water column habitats). By feature type, it has defined GES systematically for almost all criteria/indicators of the Commission Decision. Spain has not defined the GES for mammals, reptiles and habitats quantitatively. The justification for this gap however is considered sufficient and in any case, Spain refers to the relevant EU/regional/international standards to ensure that at least those are implemented (WFD, HD, OSPAR, ASCOBANS). Spain has defined GES quantitatively for birds and fish. It should be noted however that a number of GES definitions relate to maintaining current status and are not very ambitious. In addition, despite the fact that they are specific to ecosystem components, most GES definition still contain elements of vagueness which makes it difficult to assess exactly when GES is achieved. The first definition at the ecosystem level could be considered as the overall GES definition, bringing together all elements of biodiversity in a holistic definition. ;"- GES defined at the level of the criteria and indicator
- GES defined for all criteria of the Commission Decision and almost all indicators

Spain (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
In the paper report and the reporting sheets, Spain has reported at the levels of the species group and the individual species. It has not used the functional group classification, except for pelagic and demersal fish. The information reported under the species groups is relatively limited but Spain has reported in great details for individual birds, fish and mammal species. In addition, birds (at group level) and mammals (subrogated species were selected) are specifically addressed in separate paper reports in a very comprehensive manner.

For each species group, the individual species are listed and a short assessment on the condition and abundance of the group is provided. The main pressures affecting each group are reported and the information gaps and plans to address them are described. In most cases it is indicated that assessment of status was only, and just in some cases, carried out at species level (but the applicable criteria and indicators are nonetheless mentioned) and not at group level. Trends are also not provided. 

At species level, Spain reported – qualitatively and quantitatively – on the population distribution, size and condition. The main pressures are listed and the information gaps and plans to address them are also provided. The criteria and indicators used for the assessment are indicated and for some individual species trends and status assessment (and the confidence level of the assessment) are also reported. The individual species protected under the Habitats and Birds Directive are indicated.

The number of species from on which Spain has provided information in relation to all the five sub-divisions is very large and therefore these individual species are not listed here.


Habitats
Spain has reported extensively on its seabed habitats but it has not reported on water column habitats. The list of habitats is based on the EUNIS classification but adapted to the regional characteristics of the sub-divisions. In the reporting sheets that have been reported on time, Spain has also reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. In particular for the North subdivision of the NEA, Spain has reported on Littoral Rock, Littoral Sediment, Shallow Sand, Shallow Mud, Lower Bathyal Rock, Upper Bathyal Rock, Shallow Rock, Shallow Coarse Sediment, Shelf Sand, Shelf Mud, Shelf Coarse Sediment, Shelf Rock, Upper Bathyal Sediment, Lower Bathyal Sediment. It seems that Spain has not reported on water column habitats however it has reported on zooplankton and phytoplankton. In relation to Descriptor 6, only the biogenic habitats were considered, namely those included in OSPAR lists and in the Habitats Directive.

Spain refers extensively to the Habitats Directive. In addition, Spain reports on a number of special habitats noting that in certain cases these are protected under the Habitats Directive (e.g. Lagunas in the Levantino-Balear in the Western Mediterranean). However, Spain does not expressly indicate that the habitats listed in the Habitats Directive will be reported according to the timescale and format agreed under that Directive. OSPAR is also widely mentioned, including in relation to the habitats requiring special protection under this agreement (including among others Pennatulacea, sponge aggregations, Lophelia, maerl, coral gardens). The same is done in relation to the Barcelona Convention (including among others Dendropoma petraeum, Astroides caycularys, Corallina elongata, Pholas dactylus, Rissoella verrucosa).  

Where appropriate, the assessment of habitat types addresses both the abiotic (physical, hydrological, chemical) and biotic (community) aspects of each habitat. For each habitat reported, the habitat distribution, extent and condition have been described in (different levels of) detail and the main species associated listed. The information is qualitative and quantitative and numerous literary sources are cited. The criteria (1.4, 1.5 and 1.6) and indicators (1.4.1, 1.5.1, 1.6.1 and 1.6.2) used for the assessment are indicated and, in some cases, baselines and/or threshold values are also provided. However, only in very few cases trend status or definitive judgements assessing the current status are provided (in these cases the level of confidence on the assessment is provided as well). In the majority of the cases where this information is lacking, the justification provided by Spain is that there are currently no reference and/or threshold values GES/no GES. The main pressures are identified for some of the habitats.

Ecosystems
In the reporting sheets and the paper reports Spain has also reported on pelagic ecosystems for both sub-divisions of the North East Atlantic and for the Estrecho y Alboran, in the Western Mediterranean region. The information is mainly qualitative but some parameters are quantified (e.g. biomass for some species). The assessment covers the relevant functional groups, addressing the ecosystem structure and functioning (including productivity of key trophic groups/species, proportion of selected species, and abundance/distributions of key trophic groups/species). Spain indicates which criteria and indicators were used for the assessment and in few cases a trend and status assessment is provided. The information gaps and plans to address them are also reported and the insufficiency of the information on birds is particularly highlighted. Finally, fisheries are indicated as the main cause of pressure in the three sub-divisions reported. 

On the basis of the information reported on habitats, species and ecosystems, Spain has put in place a comprehensive (albeit not systematically quantified) methodology to assess the current in relation to GES (when reference values have been defined for GES). ";The initial assessment by Spain of biological features is considered adequate. It is very comprehensive and covers all major habitat zones (although in a relatively limited fashion for water column habitats) and all main species groups. The information provided is most of the time quantitative and specific and is used as a basis to make an assessment of the current status when reference values for GES have been defined. ;"Features:
- Very comprehensive assessment covering all major habitat types and main species groups
- Detailed qualitative and quantitative information
- Conclusive judgements per reference to GES when GES is available
- Identification of knowledge gaps and plans to address them";3;Adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined a large set of target for the biodiversity descriptors, which cover most but not all aspects of D1, D4 and D6. The targets are the same for all divisions the Spanish marine waters. A number of targets reported by Spain are mentioned as covering D1, 4 or 6 but actually relate more specifically to another descriptor (e.g. D2 or D3) and have therefore been assessed in the relevant sections of this report. But it should be kept in mind that biodiversity is covered by a large number of targets. 

An important number of targets are pressure- or impact-targets. They address specific activities, identified in the initial assessment as causing pressure on ecosystem components. The main pressures addressed by the targets include accidental or unwanted catches, bottom trawling and other anthropogenic activities such as dredging and aquaculture. 

The targets addressing these pressures are relatively general, using terms such as ‘reduce’, ‘maintain’ or ‘strengthen’ and are not further specified through threshold values or baselines. This means that the targets are not measurable. They are realistic and potentially achievable considering that they lack specific thresholds. They are also quite general in the sense that few targets refer to specific features. 

A number of targets relate to existing policies, networks, agreements and only recall the need for their implementation or their strengthening (e.g. Natura 2000, regulations on the commercial exploitation and by-catch of deep elasmobranchs). Another set of targets relate directly to maintain the status of species and habitats (distribution range, size, condition, etc.) These targets are quite general. They are quantified when they relate to specific thresholds described in the GES definition (e.g. Target A.3.5) or to specific indicators (e.g. Target A.3.1).  

A large number of the targets are also knowledge targets to increase knowledge on ecosystems or ecosystem components (e.g. deep sea habitats). ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Spain for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 is considered partially adequate. The targets cover the set of descriptors but lack references to specific methods of implementation and references to target states. The set of targets that relate to the status of species and habitats clearly lack ambition as they all relate to maintaining current status. While the proposed measures for increasing information availability and monitoring activities are commendable, the lack of specification regarding their implementation make it uncertain that they will be sufficient to support achieving GES by 2020. ;"- Large number of targets defined
- Mostly pressure- or impact- targets addressing specific activities
- General terms used e.g. “reduce”, “maintain”
- No thresholds/baselines defined
- Several targets relate to the implementation of existing agreements
- Several targets related to increasing knowledge and monitoring but lack of specific timeline to make them useful to achieve GES";2;Partially adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D1;Consistency ;;"The GES definition for Descriptor 1 has been defined at a high level of detail while the GES definitions for Descriptors 4 and 6 have been kept more succinct. Descriptors 4 and 6 follow more closely the Commission Decision while Descriptor 1 follows rather the structure from the initial assessment. This choice for defining Descriptor 1 according to the structure of the initial assessment has resulted in GES for specific habitats being defined under Descriptor 1 rather than Descriptor 6. 

For the Western Mediterranean a number of specific habitats are included in the GES definition while no specific habitats are mentioned for the North East Atlantic region. For the Canary subdivision Spain has also not adopted a GES definition for fish and invertebrates which is not consistent with the GES for the other regions. It should also be noted that each of the GES definitions allows either implicitly or explicitly for potential future degradation of the ecosystem. Furthermore some of the GES definitions would be more appropriately reported under Article 10 targets. 

The Initial assessment done by Spain is very extensive and reported on pressures and features in great detail. This has led to very specific GES definitions for birds but less so for other ecosystem components such as mammals, fish and habitats.  The state targets defined under Article 10 refer even less to specific ecosystem components and instead remain very general, therefore it does not seem that Spain has made full use of their initial assessment when setting the Artice 10 state and pressure targets. In general Spain has reported in a lot of detail for biodiversity but from the information provided it remains unclear for most ecosystem components (except maybe birds) at which point exactly GES and the targets are achieved.";;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor level. The criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 10 in the Commission Decision are not incorporated. The same GES definition is used for all 5 sub-regions, covering the North East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. 

The GES definition is based on the definition at descriptor level in the Directive. To this, it adds a required reduction over time of marine litter, including its degradation products. A baseline value has been set for seabed litter on the continental shelf only (the state in 2006). For other aspects, where less than 5 years of data is available, a baseline has not been set. 

Spain refers to the work done within the OSPAR ICG-MSFD working group but does not refer specifically to the OSPAR EcoQO on fulmar. Reference to OSPAR is also made for the Mediterranean subregion, no reference is made to UNEP-MAP. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 10 is considered as inadequate. GES is only defined at descriptor level and would benefit from further specification. While numerical reference conditions have been defined in the initial assessment, these are not referred to in the definition of GES meaning that it is uncertain what references Spain will use to assess its GES. ;"- GES defined only at descriptor level

Spain (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain reports to a similar level of details for all five subdivisions. It should be noted that Spain reported using the reporting sheets only for the North subdivision of the NEA. The information used for the assessment comes mostly from this subdivision but consistency checks have been made with other subdivisions. 

Spain reports substantial data on beach litter, seabed litter and plastic ingestion by marine animals. For beach litter, a differentiation between the type and material of litter is reported. Seasonal averages have been defined for each station as reference levels, thereby taking the seasonal differences in anthropogenic pressures into account. Likewise substantial data on floating litter is reported. Distinction is made between larger macro-litter, having a risk for navigation and smaller macro-litter with risks for turtles, whales and birds. A spatial distribution of floating litter is reported as well. Bottom trawling surveys have resulted in substantial data for the last 5 years. 2006 has been set as the threshold level for targets. A spatial distribution of seabed litter is reported, as well as the types of marine litter found on the seabed.

The ingestion of plastics by marine animals has been extensively assessed (including more than 60,000 individuals of 20 species of fish and elasmobranchs in the North subdivision of the NEA). Macro-litter consumption by fish, demersal elasmobranchs and pelagic fish is found to be accidental and negligible. In the North subdivision, in the period 1990-2010, a total of 69 marine mammals are detected that ingested marine litter. Among the species found, the highest incidence occurred in the common dolphin Delphinus delphis. A list of other species is reported as well. Regarding seabirds, quantitative data is reported for pelicans. Explicit reference to OSPAR or UNEP MAP is not reported. However, the monitoring of beach litter does implicitly link to OSPAR and a number of projects related to marine litter are referred to (e.g. Expedition Med, Pilot Project on Monitoring Marine Beach Litter. 

Spain makes an assessment of cumulative pressures, providing a list of criteria to identify areas that are most at risk (e.g. surface of port areas in a radius of 10 km or tourist population). Spain also makes a quantitative assessment of the current level of contamination by marine litter and a semi-quantitative assessment of impacts on marine life (using quantitative trends).

Spain then provides the reference conditions that should be used for the determination of status explaining that the benchmarks have been defined only for indicators that have sufficient spatial and temporal coverage, i.e. those for which there are series of data covering at least the last five years, and representing the entire assessment area. It then informs that because of the lack of information on many types of marine litter, reference levels could not be determined for a number of indicators. However, Spain does not make an aggregated judgement on the current level of pressure from contamination by marine litter. 

Finally, Spain reports the following needs: the development of a monitoring network, better understanding of the origins of waste and the impacts of waste on the marine environment and an assessment methodology. Reported data has been collected by NGOs or research institutes. Also in Spain, legislation to manage the amounts of waste in the sea does not exist. ";The initial assessment by Spain of marine litter is considered adequate. The available data has been presented and some information gaps are identified. Spain has tried to identify reference conditions to be used for the assessment of current status but has not been able to make an aggregated judgement at this stage. ;"- Qualitative and quantitative assessment made
- Different types of litter reported on
- Spatial distribution of litter
- Reference conditions to be used for assessment of current status provided
- No aggregated judgement made because of lack of data";3;Adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain reports six targets that are specific for marine litter. All six targets are reported for the two subdivisions of the NEA region (North and South). For the two sub-regions of the Western Mediterranean (Levantino-Balear and Estrecho y Alborán), five out of six are reported (B1.9 has not been reported). For the Canary Islands, only three targets out of six are reported (B.1.7, B.1.8 and B.1.9 are not reported). Associated indicators have been identified for all six targets.

In addition to these six targets, Spain has reported that D10 is addressed also through two targets that are not specific to marine litter. One of them relates to wastewater discharges (B.1.1) and covers also the other pollution descriptors (D5, D8 and D9) and the other one relates to impacts of human activities on biodiversity components (C.3.5). 

Out of these eight targets, two aim to increase the knowledge base on marine litter, respectively on their origin and dispersion (B.3.3) and on the impact of human activities on habitats (C.3.5). Two aim to reduce the amount of marine litter generated by both terrestrial and marine sources (B.1.5) and discharged into the marine environment marine through rivers or sewers (B.1.1). There is no information on threshold value and baseline to make these two last targets fully measurable. 

The specific targets on marine litter aim to achieve respectively a reduction of marine litter on the coastline (B1.6) and litter from fisheries (B1.7, B1.8, B1.9). The reduction of litter from fisheries is expressed both as the area (B1.7) and the weight per unit area (B1.8) of litter on the seabed of the continental shelf and as litter from fisheries on beaches (B1.9). While the reduction for beach litter on the beach has been identified for all 5 sub-regions, the target on beach target originating from fisheries is only identified for the two sub-regions of the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast (North and South sub-regions). The targets for sea-bed litter have been identified for the sub-regions of the North East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean, except for the Canary Islands. 

The specific targets are also difficult to measure because of a lack of specificity regarding threshold values. The focus of Spain on the sources of marine litter especially on rivers and from fisheries is considered valuable and could lead to the achievement of GES after further specification of the targets and potential specification of threshold values to the associated indicators. It is for instance not clear how the litter from fisheries is being distinguished from other types of litter. Finally, targets have not been set to reduce impact of marine litter on the marine environment, presumably because of lack of data (which is consistent with the definition of target C.3.5).

The 2012 initial assessment is reported as the baseline. For plastic discharge by rivers, the baseline is reported as the volume of direct and indirect discharge without adequate treatment occurring at present (2012)..";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators covering D10 is considered partially adequate. Spain reports eight targets, out of which six are specific to marine litter (but are not reported consistently for all subregions/subdivisions). The targets are difficult to measure and would benefit from further specification.;"- Targets specific for marine litter focus on reducing input of litter from various sources
- Potentially measurable but lack of threshold values
- No target on the impact of litter on ecosystem components because of lack of data";2;Partially adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D10;Consistency ;;"The assessment of level of and impacts from contamination by marine litter is consistent with the definition of GES as this one is very general and unspecific. However, the reference conditions defined in the initial assessment are not referred to in the GES definition meaning that it is uncertain whether these references should be used to assess GES or not. 

The set of baselines is confusing. In the reporting sheets, Spain sets the status of 2006 as baseline for seabed litter and none other for the other types of marine litter. However, in the IA Spain seems to define reference values for beach litter (by seasonal average). In addition, the 2006 baseline for seabed litter has not been used as baseline for targets on seabed litter. The 2012 assessment has been used as the baseline for targets. This baseline is however not used in the GES definition and none was identified (except for seabed litter) due, according to Spain, to a lack of a long time series (>5 years) and limited spatial coverage. It is unclear why the baseline of 2012 has been chosen for the targets and not the GES and how the baseline of 2006 for seabed litter is reflected in the targets. 

Spain explicitly states that the target serve the purpose of achieving GES. Spain reports one overall target, eight general targets valid for all sub-regions and depending on sub-region, 2-4 sub-region specific targets. Targets address the sources of marine litter, including discharge by rivers and from fisheries and could, when specified further thus effectively contribute to achieving GES. In addition, a set of targets are identified which can be considered as essential boundary conditions, mainly the targets related to the management of marine litter and involvement of stakeholders.

Spain (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 11 at descriptor and criteria levels. The definition is the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report and is applicable to all five sub-divisions. All criteria and indicator laid out for Descriptor 11 in the Commission Decision are incorporated. However, according to Spain, impulsive sounds covering all frequencies (low, medium and high) have to be covered. 

The MSFD only focuses on low-medium impulsive sounds, i.e. only impulsive sounds up to 10 kHz must be taken into account. According to the Spanish definition however, higher sounds should also be assessed (e.g. all high frequency boat sonar (from pleasure boats etc.)) Thus, Spain has, either deliberately or unintentionally, increased the scope of indicator 11.1.1 enormously. In addition, no thresholds or reference values have been provided.";The GES definition of Spain for D11 is assessed as inadequate. Although the Spanish definition is not a mere reproduction of the MSFD, the differences between the two concepts have as a consequence that the Spanish GES definition actually covers a much wider scope of sounds. No thresholds or reference values have been provided.;"- GES defined only descriptor level

Spain (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain has carried out an initial assessment on the introduction of energy on the marine environment. The structure and depth of the assessments is very similar for all five sub-divisions and therefore they are analyzed in conjunction. Spain recognizes that there are gaps in knowledge that hinder a more deep assessment but in general, and for all five sub-regions, a lot of detail is provided considering the existing data. In addition, it is acknowledged the need of taking appropriate measures to increase the knowledge on underwater noise and its impacts, such as gathering of systematic information on impacts or the establishment of adequate monitoring programmes.  

The main causes of pressure are indicated but due to the unclear definition of 11.1.1, on certain occasion some sources are listed that do not fall under 11.1.1 category such as for example sand mining, discharges of dredged material. The main species affected are listed and the consequence of the impacts briefly referred to, but again, the lack of knowledge prevents a deeper analysis.

Spain (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined two targets to address Descriptor 11. The targets are identical in the reporting sheets and in the paper report and apply to all five sub-regions (although they have different names depending on the sub-region concerned).

The two targets are unspecific and cannot be traced back to the Commission Decision criteria and indicators. They cannot be considered as sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact, or controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved. The first target is rather an expression of GES than an actual target. They are not ambitious. ";The set of environmental targets defined by Spain for D11 is assessed as inadequate.

The targets are not ambitious, neither sufficient to achieve GES.;"- Targets are very general and are rather expression of GES than actual targets focused on controlling human activities

Spain (North East Atlantic);D11;Consistency ;;The assessment of the pressures is consistent with Spain’s definition of GES. The definition of GES is very wide, much wider than in the MSFD, as is the scope of activities causing the pressure that are covered in the initial assessment. The set of targets, however, it is not considered adequate to address the pressures identified in the initial assessment – the targets are unspecific and not ambitious. The targets reported by Spain will not allow the achievement of GES for D11.;;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"GES is determined only at descriptor and criteria level in the same way for all Spanish sub-regions and divisions. The first definition relates to the GES definition at descriptor level but also includes some elements of criteria 2.2. The descriptor definition refers to maintaining biodiversity in general and in relation to habitats and commercial species. On the whole, the current state of biodiversity, habitats, commercial species and fish stocks (initial assessment) is used as a baseline.  The second part of the definition targets more precisely one well studied taxonomic group, the macroalgae, and provides a direct link to the initial assessment by referring to the state of the habitat threatened by this particular invasive NIS. This is a detailed specification of the indicator 2.2.1. 

The second definition focuses on the reduction of the risk of introduction and spread of NIS directly targeting the main vectors of introduction. It primarily details the descriptor definition set in Annex I of the Directive and also relates indirectly to criteria 2.1. The main vectors are not specified in the definition itself. However, these are detailed in the environmental targets (see below). There is no indication on the extent of the required reductionof NIS introductions. Finally considering that the definition does not require no new NIS introductions it does not meet the minimum requirements.";The GES definition for D2 is assessed as partially adequate. GES is defined at descriptor, criteria and indicator level (2.1, 2.2 and 2.1.1). It addresses both the risk of introduction and spreading of invasive NIS and the prevention of the deterioration of the initial state due to pressure by NIS. One type of invasive NIS is specifically mentioned (macro-algae) and the definition is set at indicator level. One of the definitions does not include a baseline or reference conditions but only refers to a minimisation of risks. Since the definition does not require no further introductions of NIS it does not meet the minimum requirements.;"- GES defined at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels

Spain (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"North subdivision
NIS has not been reported on in the reporting sheets downloaded before the deadline of April 2013. 

The paper report describes and comments on many available studies. It is noted that only 28 of the alien species cited have been defined by studies as potentially invasive. The main ones are identified and described in the paper report (Asparagopsis armata, Sargassum muticum, Undaria pinnatífida, Crassostrea gigas, Tapes philippinarum, Cyclope neritea, Eriocheir sinensis, Hemigrapsus takanoi, Ficopomatus enigmaticus). For these, the sources, localisation and impacts are described at a rather general level. There is no judgement on trends.

The knowledge gaps have been identified and would be addressed through increasing the resources devoted to research in marine ecology. All possible vectors and pathways are extensively described and pressure accumulation is considered to assess the areas at greater risk.

South subdivision
The paper report provides an assessment of NIS, while there is no information on NIS in the reporting sheets downloaded before the deadline of April. Based on the existing literature, 19 potentially invasive species are listed, this out of 88 considered as NIS (Asparagopsis armata, Corbicula fluminea, Crassostrea gigas, Mytilopsis leucophaeata y Ruditapes philippinarum, Blackfordia virginica, Cordylophora caspia, Diumedea lineate, Oculina patagónica, Acartia tonsa, Eriocheir sinensis, Callinectes sapidus, Palaemon macrodactylus y Rhithropanopeus harrisii; el gasterópodo Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Chaetopleura angulata, Paracerceis sculpta, Paradella dianae, Ficopomatus enigmaticus). 

A very general description of the impacts is provided concluding that a full assessment could be made only in the future. The main vectors and pathways are described in details and pressure accumulation is considered to assess the areas at greater risk. 

Canary
No reporting sheets on the initial assessments have been provided for the Canary sub-region. The assessment is based only on the paper report. On the basis of existing literature, Spain has identified 60 NIS, listed in the report. In the paper report, all possible vectors and pathways are extensively described and pressure accumulation is considered to assess the areas at greater risk.

A very general description of the impacts is provided concluding that a full assessment could be made only in the future. Impacts are considered as limited, with the exception of some specific ecologically rich areas. The trend in pressure is not assessed.";The assessment is considered to be partially adequate. Spain has analysed existing information, identifying the main NIS present in the sub-region, with particular attention paid to invasive NIS.

Spain (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The environmental targets are identical for all five sub-divisions. The three first targets are pressure and impact related targets. In addition, there is one operational target on future studies aiming at addressing knowledge gaps.

The first target is specific, relating to the minimisation of introduction or spreading of NIS. It specifically addresses at least 8 introduction pathways for which avoidance and/or control of introduction should take place. It is not measurable in the current state of knowledge. Whether it is achievable depends on the definition of minimisation, avoidance and control. However, the indicator (number of policy measures) remains rather vague and does not focus on results. The reporting sheet indicates that further development is needed and that the indicator is expected to be operational by 2018 if adopted. The deadline for reaching the target is December 2020.

The level of ambitious depends (along with achievability) on the definition of minimization, avoidance, control. 

The second target is specific (eradication or reduction in the abundance of invasive NIS). Eradication would not be realistic, but the target also focuses on reduction and includes some precautionary wording (whenever technically feasible). It could be measurable if combined with a monitoring network/programme, which would be necessary in order to implement the associated indicator. The indicator consists in the number of invasive species and areas in which eradication or abundance reduction measures are taking place. This is clearly not immediately operational. Similarly to the first target, the reporting sheet indicates that further development is needed in relation to the associated indicator, which is expected to be operational by 2018 if adopted. The deadline is for reaching the target is December 2020.

The target is very ambitious, eradication or reduction of species is difficult and costly. One major question is the condition that ‘no collateral damage is produced’. It is very unlikely that there will be no collateral damage when eradicating or reducing invasive species. This may prevent this target from being effective, hence ambitious.

The third target is specific to marine farming, including farming of non-native species, and aims at preventing impacts on the trophic web. However, it is not clearly measurable in the absence of baseline or reference levels although it could be measured through the number of measures taken to prevent impacts. It is considered as achievable. The associated indicator (to be further developed and be operational by 2018 if adopted) relates to surveillance systems, which suggests that this target will be measured in terms of extent of impacts. The deadline for reaching the target is December 2020. This target is rather ambitious – preventing impact on the tropic web although it depends to which extent the impacts should be prevented.

The fourth target relates to research and monitoring in relation to NIS. It is rather specific if to consider it in combination with all data and knowledge gaps identified in the initial assessment. However, this link is only implicit. It is difficult to measure, in the absence of specifications as to the results to be achieved. The proposed associated indicator refers to the number of studies undertaken and percentage of the division area covered by regular monitoring programmes. Therefore, it is achievable only in relation to the establishment of a monitoring network and coordination at national level while it is not clear which level of knowledge is to be reached. The deadline for reaching the target is December 2020. If to consider that the target aim at addressing the gaps in knowledge identified in the initial assessment, the level of ambition is potentially high although it depends on the extent to which these gaps will be addressed.";The targets set by Spain in relation to Descriptor 2 are considered as a whole partially adequate. All main pressures are specifically covered by the three pressure and impact related targets. The level of ambition varies from one target to another and the fact that indicators need to be further developed before becoming operational leads to some uncertainty.;"- All main pressures specifically covered
- Lack of specification for some proposed targets
- Various level of ambition 
- Uncertainty as some indicators need further development to become operational";2;Partially adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D2;Consistency ;;The assessment of the pressure and its impacts is considered as consistent with the Spanish definition of GES. The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 2 cover all the different pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 2 identified in the initial assessment. While the initial assessment of pressures and impacts is quite general, the environmental targets and associated indicators are rather extensive and cover most possible pressures. The set of environmental targets if properly achieved would be sufficient to achieve GES.;;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Spanish GES has been defined at the criteria level and specifically for criterion 3.1 and 3.2. Criterion 3.3 has not been used to define the Spanish GES. Reference levels will be based on analytical evaluations from ICES for the Atlantic sub-regions and CGPM for the Mediterranean sub-regions and ICCAT for tuna stocks in both sub-regions. The way that Spain has defined criteria 3.1 and 3.2 diverges from the Commission Decision and outcomes of the WG GES workshop on D3 in a number of ways.  

The Spanish GES definition for criterion 3.1 states that at least 50% of stocks need to exploited at or below Fmsy while the Commission Decision requires that 100% of stocks are exploited at Fmsy. Furthermore Spain states that no stocks should be exploited at a level higher than F/Fmsy>1.6 which should ensure that no stocks are exploited above Fpa, it is not certain that this rule would ensure that no stocks are exploited above safe biological limits since there are no defined rules linking MSY to PA levels.

Criterion 3.2 states that 50% of stocks should be at SSBmsy and no stocks should be at SSB/SSBmsy < 0.6. The Descriptor text as provided in Annex 1 of the MSFD however requires that all exploited fish and shellfish stocks are within safe biological limits, which clearly requires that no stocks are below SSBpa levels. This is not ensured by the Spanish GES definition since there are no rules linking MSY and PA levels.

Lastly Spain has not applied criterion 3.3 when defining their GES and has not provided a justification for not doing so. While the Commission acknowledges that no thresholds and baselines can currently be set for this criterion it has been concluded that it should be used by MS.";For criterion 3.1 the level of fishing mortality should be set at Fmsy for all stocks while Spain requires it for 50% of their stocks. Criterion 3.2 should ensure that the SSB of stocks are at least at PA levels, which is not ensured by the Spanish GES conditions. Criterion 3.3 has not been used by Spain to define GES. ;"- The GES requires the achievement of GES for only 50% of the commercially exploited species
- Criterion 3.2 definition insufficient to ensure that no stocks have a SSB outside of safe biological limits
- Criterion 3.3 not applied";1;Inadequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain reports to a similar level of details for all five subdivisions, using the same methodology to make an assessment of the current levels of and impacts from the extraction pressure. The Spanish initial assessment reports in detail on the level of pressure from fisheries and assesses the status of fish stocks using the following methodologies. 

Fishing mortality:
•	F/Fmsy & F(average last analyzed 3 years)/Fmsy, (<=1,0 = best); (>1,0 y <=1,6 = average); (>1,6 = poor)
•	[F(last(analyzed) year - historical time series)]/average historical F & [F(previous 3 years - historical time series)]/average historical F (<=0,0 = best); (>0,0 y <=1,6 = average); (>1,6 = poor)  
•	F(average last analyzed 2 years)/F(average previous 3 years). (>1.2 – poor)

Spawning stock biomass:
•	SSB/SSBmsy & SSB(average previous 3 years)/SSBmsy, (<=1,0 = good); (>1,0 y <=1,6 =average); (>1,6 = poor)
•	[SSB(last year - historical time series)]/average historical SSB & [SSB(last 3 years - historical time series)]/average historical SSB (<=0,0 = good); (>0,0 y <=1,6 = average); (>1,6 = poor)
•	SSB(average last analyzed 2 years)/SSB(average previous 3 years) (>1,2 = poor)

The selection criterion for the stocks to be assessed has been clearly explained in the text and gaps in data and knowledge are identified. 

For the North and South Atlantic and Levantino-Balear sub-regions, more reference values for Fmsy for fish stocks are available than for the Estrecho y Alboran and Canarias sub-regions. In regard to the Canarias sub-region the majority of stocks lack any form of reference points including estimates of historical fishing mortality levels. There are also fewer SSBmsy reference points available than Fmsy reference points and in the case of the Lavantino-balear subdivision there are no SSbmsy reference points at all. For non-fish stocks such as cephalopods there are no MSY reference points defined. 

In general the stock status as estimated using MSY reference points resulted in more stocks being considered in poor condition than when the alternative method relying on previously observed F and SSB levels was used. The discrepancy in the results when using MSY reference points compared to the alternative method relying on time series can partially be explained by the fact that the time series used are quite short. In regards to the Levantino-Balear most stocks are indicated as being exploited at levels higher than Fmsy. For other regions the current situation is less clear due to data gaps and more diverse outcomes with some stocks being exploited at or below Fmsy while other stocks are overexploited. 

Spain has described the fishing fleets in the reporting sheets providing information on vessel tonnage and fishing days. Fishery impacts are not described for all subregions in the reporting sheets but are covered at various levels of detail in the reports analysing human pressures in the subregion. Impacts described are those on by-catch of marine turtles, cetaceans and birds.";The initial assessment of Spain for the pressure of fisheries is assessed as adequate. The assessment covers the most relevant stocks explaining their selection criteria for inclusion and has made a judgement on their status. Gaps in knowledge and data necessary for the assessment of Descriptor 3 are identified. The alternative methodologies provided for assessing the status of data deficient stocks are useful but the outcomes seem less stringent than the methodology relying on MSY reference points and therefore resulted in more stocks being assessed as being at good status. Furthermore Spain has reported on fleets and general impacts of fisheries. ;"- Relevant stocks assessed with judgement of status
- Fleets reported on
- Impacts reported on";3;Adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined 12 targets to address Descriptor 3. The targets are the same for all subdivisions. A number of targets indicated to be relevant for Descriptor 3 are also relevant for biodiversity conservation and are therefore discussed in relation to the biodiversity descriptors. The Spanish targets are generally characterized by a lack of detail but include state, pressure and operational targets. 

The second part of target A3.4 states that commercially exploited species will be maintained within safe biological limits, while target C1.6 states that the management of stocks should be adequate to keep fish stocks within safe biological limits. The threshold for Targets 1.6 and A3.4 is not specified so this target could mean that stocks are at or above SSBpa or that no stock is at SSB/SSBMSY<0.6 as could be understood from the GES definition. The targets do not specifically state the number or percentage of stocks that are exploited within safe biological limits and are therefore not SMART.

Targets A.3.1 and A3.2 are related to criterion 3.3 from the 2010 Commission Decision but this criterion has not been applied to define the Spanish GES. In regard to Target 3.1 it is stated that the size distribution of Teleosts, demersal elasmobranches and benthic fish should remain stable, however for certain stocks it might be desirable for the size distribution to shift towards larger individuals due to past changes. Therefore for this target it might be appropriate to include the condition “or increase.”

Target C3.7 is a target to improve knowledge for species in regard to Descriptor 3 and the relevant indicators. Considering the gaps identified in the initial assessment this is necessary but the target is not SMART. Target A1.9 is a target to ensure adequate surveillance of the marine environment which is an essential part of ensuring that stocks are exploited in accordance with regulations, the target however is not SMART. ";The set of environmental targets is partially adequate as they are not sufficiently specific or state that stocks will be exploited at Fmsy, instead targets seem to focus on exploiting targets at levels at or below Fpa. The targets do require all stocks to be within safe biological limits. The targets as a set do not seem sufficient to fully achieve GES. Not all targets are fully measurable.;"- Targets require all commercially exploited species to be within safe biological limits
- Targets do not clearly aim to exploit stocks at Fmsy, instead the phrasing implies the use of Fpa
- Targets not all fully measurable";2;Partially adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D3;Consistency ;;The Spanish GES and the targets lack ambition to achieve GES by 2020 as it is understood from the Commission Decision and subsequent working group conclusions. The initial assessment has used the GES as defined by Spain to judge the status of Spanish stocks and has been done this in a comprehensive manner with well explained methodologies.  While the GES and initial assessment are specific, the targets lack detail. ;;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 4 at criteria level. The GES definitions are similar for all marine subdivisions. In addition, in the reporting sheets, Spain has reported one additional criterion on populations of birds, for the subdivisions of Canary, Estrecho y Alborán and Levantino-Balear. It is not clear why it has not been reported for the other two subdivisions. 

The definition of GES, which is common to all subdivisions, deviates from the definition of Descriptor 4 as provided in Annex I of the MSFD in a number of ways. In particular text of the Directive states that all elements of marine food webs to the extent they are known occur at normal abundance and diversity while the Spanish definition requires maintenance of the functioning of the food web. The implication of the GES definition as it is formulated by Spain is that the abundance and diversity of food web components can be at lower levels than normal (natural) as long as the trophic web and existing predator-prey relationships are kept. 

The Spanish definition specifically mentions “energy transfers” in its first part. It also addresses specific human activities to be controlled for the achievement of GES (eutrophication, selective extraction of species) in its last part, which is not included in the Commission Decision. 

The definition of criteria 4.1 and 4.3 implies that the current situation is the baseline and threshold to be maintained for the abundance of the main trophic groups, although it is unclear what constitutes the main trophic groups. The definition of criterion 4.2 implies that selected species at the top of food webs should be within safe biological limits but this could potentially allow for degradation in the current status of some of these species. Spain does justify not using indicators 4.2.1 and 4.3.1. Indicator 4.2.1 is considered not appropriate for Spanish waters while indicator 4.3.1 requires further development for it to be used to define GES. In addition, a number of GES definitions for D1 are also relevant for D4 (explained by the strong links across the biodiversity descriptors), in particular the statements on the status of the fish community. 

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Adequate; 3):

Ecosystems
At ecosystem level, Spain has one general definition which stipulates that ecosystem structure and function remain consistent with prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic conditions (which are specified as maintained diversity of species and habitats and complexity of trophic levels). It is not clear what the term “maintain” refers to. Presumably it refers to the current status. 

In addition to this qualitative definition, Spain has provided three quantitative expressions of GES: two for fish and one for birds (reported under the “birds” section). The indicators for fish reflect the status of fish communities (average maximum size and conservation status of fish). The indicator for the bird community is based on the IBA criteria (presumably in line with the BHD). Two out of three indicators have numerical threshold values attached to them (CSF and IBA) and the last one if trend-based. A baseline is defined only for the two fish indicators. For the IBA indicator, no baseline is defined but presumably it is the current status. 

Finally, it should be mentioned that Spain has defined an additional indicator/criterion for the definition of GES at ecosystem level for the North subdivision of the NEA marine region only (not reproduced for any other subdivisions). This indicator relates to the structure of the planktonic community.";The definition of GES for D4 is considered inadequate. It is defined in a rather general way and lacks thresholds as well as specification of the ecosystem components addressed, such as “main trophic groups” and their interactions. In addition, the formulation of GES seems to indicate that the abundance and diversity of food web components can be at lower levels than natural conditions as long as the trophic web and existing predator-prey relationships are kept. But Spain indicates that many definitions for D1 are also relevant for D4 and provides a justification for not using all the indicators of the Commission Decision. ;"- GES defined at criteria level

Ecosystems
In the reporting sheets and the paper reports Spain has also reported on pelagic ecosystems for both sub-divisions of the North East Atlantic and for the Estrecho y Alboran, in the Western Mediterranean region. The information is mainly qualitative but some parameters are quantified (e.g. biomass for some species). The assessment covers the relevant functional groups, addressing the ecosystem structure and functioning (including productivity of key trophic groups/species, proportion of selected species, and abundance/distributions of key trophic groups/species). Spain indicates which criteria and indicators were used for the assessment and in few cases a trend and status assessment is provided. The information gaps and plans to address them are also reported and the insufficiency of the information on birds is particularly highlighted. Finally, fisheries are indicated as the main cause of pressure in the three sub-divisions reported. 

On the basis of the information reported on habitats, species and ecosystems, Spain has put in place a comprehensive (albeit not systematically quantified) methodology to assess the current in relation to GES (when reference values have been defined for GES). ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The initial assessment by Spain of biological features is considered adequate. It is very comprehensive and covers all major habitat zones (although in a relatively limited fashion for water column habitats) and all main species groups.

Spain (North East Atlantic);D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Spain has defined a large set of target for the biodiversity descriptors, which cover most but not all aspects of D1, D4 and D6. The targets are the same for all divisions the Spanish marine waters. A number of targets reported by Spain are mentioned as covering D1, 4 or 6 but actually relate more specifically to another descriptor (e.g. D2 or D3) and have therefore been assessed in the relevant sections of this report. But it should be kept in mind that biodiversity is covered by a large number of targets. 

An important number of targets are pressure- or impact-targets. They address specific activities, identified in the initial assessment as causing pressure on ecosystem components. The main pressures addressed by the targets include accidental or unwanted catches, bottom trawling and other anthropogenic activities such as dredging and aquaculture. 

The targets addressing these pressures are relatively general, using terms such as ‘reduce’, ‘maintain’ or ‘strengthen’ and are not further specified through threshold values or baselines. This means that the targets are not measurable. They are realistic and potentially achievable considering that they lack specific thresholds. They are also quite general in the sense that few targets refer to specific features. 

A number of targets relate to existing policies, networks, agreements and only recall the need for their implementation or their strengthening (e.g. Natura 2000, regulations on the commercial exploitation and by-catch of deep elasmobranchs). Another set of targets relate directly to maintain the status of species and habitats (distribution range, size, condition, etc.) These targets are quite general. They are quantified when they relate to specific thresholds described in the GES definition (e.g. Target A.3.5) or to specific indicators (e.g. Target A.3.1).  

A large number of the targets are also knowledge targets to increase knowledge on ecosystems or ecosystem components (e.g. deep sea habitats). 
";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of targets and indicators defined by Spain for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 is considered partially adequate. The targets cover the set of descriptors but lack references to specific methods of implementation and references to target states. The set of targets that relate to the status of species and habitats clearly lack ambition as they all relate to maintaining current status. While the proposed measures for increasing information availability and monitoring activities are commendable, the lack of specification regarding their implementation make it uncertain that they will be sufficient to support achieving GES by 2020. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Spain (North East Atlantic);D4;Consistency ;;"The GES definition for Descriptor 1 has been defined at a high level of detail while the GES definitions for Descriptors 4 and 6 have been kept more succinct. Descriptors 4 and 6 follow more closely the Commission Decision while Descriptor 1 follows rather the structure from the initial assessment. This choice for defining Descriptor 1 according to the structure of the initial assessment has resulted in GES for specific habitats being defined under Descriptor 1 rather than Descriptor 6. 

For the Western Mediterranean a number of specific habitats are included in the GES definition while no specific habitats are mentioned for the North East Atlantic region. For the Canary subdivision Spain has also not adopted a GES definition for fish and invertebrates which is not consistent with the GES for the other regions. It should also be noted that each of the GES definitions allows either implicitly or explicitly for potential future degradation of the ecosystem. Furthermore some of the GES definitions would be more appropriately reported under Article 10 targets. 

The Initial assessment done by Spain is very extensive and reported on pressures and features in great detail. This has led to very specific GES definitions for birds but less so for other ecosystem components such as mammals, fish and habitats.  The state targets defined under Article 10 refer even less to specific ecosystem components and instead remain very general, therefore it does not seem that Spain has made full use of their initial assessment when setting the Artice 10 state and pressure targets. In general Spain has reported in a lot of detail for biodiversity but from the information provided it remains unclear for most ecosystem components (except maybe birds) at which point exactly GES and the targets are achieved.






";;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at criteria and indicator levels, both in the reporting sheets and the paper report. The GES definition for eutrophication is very similar for all sub-divisions of the North Atlantic. The Canary subdivision is not included in the OSPAR convention area, but the OSPAR approach has been adopted for MSFD implementation in Spanish Canary waters. 

All criteria and indicators laid out for Descriptor 5 in the Commission Decision appear to be utilized, except for nutrient ratios (indicator 5.1.2, but this is only applicable ‘where appropriate’). Water transparency (indicator 5.2.2) is included by the phrase “there are no decreasing trends in transparency” i.e. this is a trend threshold, not a quantitative value. Macrophytobenthos communities are dealt with by the phrase “there are no increases in the communities that can be explained by increase in the nutrients concentration”. Thus, opportunistic species are dealt with (indicator 5.2.3), but perennial phytobenthos (indicator 5.3.1) may not be – this depends on what type of phytobenthos monitoring and thresholds are in place for coastal waters under the WFD. Oxygen thresholds (indicator 5.3.2) are presented in terms of % saturation, but whether fauna can survive in conditions of oxygen stress is more closely related to absolute concentrations (in mg/l), rather than relative concentrations (% saturation), which vary with temperature. Another indicator over which there is uncertainty is 5.2.4 (Species shifts in floristic composition. It is not specified whether this indicator is dealt with under WFD monitoring or is be addressed under OSPAR’s development of a phytoplankton-based index.

The accompanying text to the GES definition states that the OSPAR Common Procedure could be used to define GES in areas as having “no eutrophication problems”, but the information required for the OSPAR screening procedure is less complete than that required for MSFD reporting purposes. However, for waters identified as being either eutrophication problem areas or potential problem areas, the Common Procedure is applied. The indicators required for this encompass most (but not all) Descriptor 5 indicators of the Commission Decision, plus other ones.";The GES definition of Spain for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition of GES therefore meets the minimum requirements, and uses the same indicators as specified in the Commission Decision. The definition of GES takes account of WFD normative definitions for coastal waters. Detailed information on specific concentrations, threshold values and baselines is not provided. Potential impacts on phytobenthos communities appear to be covered by the statement that “there are no changes in communities attributable to increasing concentration of nutrients” but it is not clear if perennial phytobenthos and species shifts in floristic composition are covered.The Spanish approach appears to be that GES can be achieved in areas of high nutrient status where no (or minor) direct and indirect impacts occur.;"- GES definition covers all the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision

Spain (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"North and South subdivisions
Spain has carried out an initial assessment for the North and South sub-divisions of the North Atlantic. The level of depth of the assessment is very similar for both sub-regions and therefore they are analyzed together. The information – qualitative and quantitative – is much more comprehensive in the paper report than in the reporting sheets.  It is stated that comprehensive data only exists in relation to some of the forms of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, and for that reason the assessment is made in relation to those substances. Except for the coastal waters, the pressure-impact analysis does not provide a lot of or no quantitative information at all on individual pressures in terms of nutrient/organic loading to the sea; in any case, urban discharges, industry and aquaculture are indicated as the main causes of pressure and the main features impacted are listed. In addition, concentration levels of the relevant substances for the assessment areas are reported.

The report covers phytoplankton density and nutrient levels; the information on water transparency and dissolved oxygen is very limited and (mostly for the North sub-division) only in relation to a few sampling stations. In relation to the North sub-division, beyond mentioning that microalgae have been assessed under the WFD and that it was concluded these were in “very good status” and that there have been no occurrences of explosive growth of opportunistic macroalgae, the report does not contain much more information on impacts on phytobenthos community status. For the South sub-division, impact on phytobenthos communities does not appear to be addressed at all, at least not under Descriptor 5.

Status assessment is only provided in relation to some of the pressures and impacts and not for areas assessed, but GES is considered to be achieved in all the sub-division. However, it is concluded that “some” coastal areas of the sub-region could be classified as “potential eutrophication problem areas”, conclusion which appears valid and is sustained by trends assessment in relation to the relevant indicators (even if for some areas only a minor part of the indicators are covered). 

Canary
A partial assessment has been undertaken, but lack of data has prevented the OSPAR Common Procedure from being used to assess trophic status. Nevertheless, remote sensing (satellite) data show that chlorophyll concentrations in the coastal zone of the Canary Isles differ little from concentration in open ocean areas. The latter can be considered as reference areas because they have low anthropogenic nutrient/organic pressure. If that is accepted, Spanish waters of the sub-region are unlikely to contain other eutrophication impacts, although this is not a definitive statement since relatively few nutrient (or other impact) data were available.

Input loads of nitrogen and phosphorus have been calculated/estimated, but not organic loads. The extent to which nutrient levels in the sea have been assessed is not clear and indirect effects of eutrophication are still not assessed, although direct effects have been partially assessed (chlorophyll levels). No assessment has been made on whether the current pressures or status are improving, worsening or remaining stable. From the information presented, it appears that Spanish marine waters surrounding the Canary Isles are affected by eutrophication only to an acceptable level.
";The initial assessment of Spain for the NEA marine region with regard to eutrophication is considered adequate. While there seems to be limited information in terms of nutrient and organic loads to the sea and not all impacts are adequately covered, there is considerable information – qualitative and quantitative – in relation to most of the relevant indicators. Trends and status assessments are also provided and clear reference is made to the OSPAR approach and to the WFD standards.;"- Considerable information on most indicators (qualitative and quantitative)
- More limited information on impacts and loads to the sea
- Trends and conclusive judgements (per reference to GES) are provided

Spain (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has reported four targets to address Descriptor 5 in the North sub-division of the North East Atlantic region and in both sub-divisions of the Mediterranean Sea, but only three of these targets apply for the remaining Spanish sub-divisions i.e. South and Canary in the North East Atlantic. The targets are the same in the paper report and in the reporting sheets and very similar for all sub-divisions.

Target B.1.1 is unspecific with regard to individual pressures (sources of nutrients). It would be easier to measure for point sources than diffuse sources and river loads, but for eutrophication the emphasis should be on reducing pollutant (nutrient and organic) loads, rather than the volume discharged. This places the emphasis on improving wastewater treatment efficiency, and thereby on point sources of pollution. A reduction in pressures is both achievable and realistic as a qualitative target, but no quantification is provided. The target is not time-bound. It is specific with regard to point sources of nutrients/organic matter, and presumably those not targeted under the UWWTD Directive or IPPC legislation, but if GES for Descriptor 5 is already being achieved there is likely to be no emphasis on improving the current situation.

Target B1.3 is clear, but the base/reference values are not specified (although there is a reference to OSPAR for the South sub-division of the North Atlantic). In essence this represents a reduced target for D5, compared to what is specified in the Directive or the 2010 Commission Decision. The target would be specific and measurable once the base/reference values are defined. It appears to be realistic, achievable and time bound. It does not tackle any individual pressures, but rather ‘total’ eutrophication pressures. The target refers only to marine nutrient concentrations; not to direct or indirect impacts of elevated nutrient levels.

Target B1.4 is directly related to the good ecological status of the WFD and as such is directly related to GES. In light of the above targets it is measureable and potentially achievable, but probably not realistic (by 2020 at least). 

Target B3.1 is specific with regard to one pressure, and measurable with regard to its success or failure – it either will or won’t improve quantification of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (in particular), but linking this to increased primary productivity will be more uncertain. The target is not time-bound, and whether it is realistic or achievable remains to be seen.

The targets are not considered to be sufficiently targeted or ambitious towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact, or controlling human activities, which are preventing GES from being achieved. The first target is aimed at pressures (point sources), and the second at impacts, but as they are only qualitative, any improvement(s) are likely to be small. The third and the fourth targets (just research) do not address pressures or impacts at all. 

The targets are not complete and not sufficiently specific. The targets are designed to achieve pressure reduction, but predominantly from point sources. The fourth target does not attempt to reduce atmospheric deposition, only to better understand its impact. The indicators of GES are the same as those laid down in the 2010 Commission Decision.";The set of environmental targets defined by Spain for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The targets are only qualitative and therefore they are not considered to be sufficiently targeted or ambitious towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact. In addition, the targets are not consistent, or at least not complete and sufficiently specific. A more ambitious set of targets would be quantitative and also tackle diffuse sources of nutrients/organic material.  ;"- Designed to achieve pressure reduction, but predominantly from point sources
- Not sufficiently targeted or ambitious to reduce levels of a individual pressures or impacts
- Qualitative targets";2;Partially adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D5;Consistency ;;"North East Atlantic (North and South)
The assessment of eutrophication and its impacts does not appear to be completely consistent with Spain’s definition of GES for eutrophication. Overall nutrient loads (dissolved, not total fractions) have been estimated, but information is lacking on individual sources. Organic loads have not been estimated. Not all impacts/indicators are covered; only phytoplankton density and nutrient levels. Impacts on phytobenthos community status, water transparency and dissolved oxygen status have not been included in the IA, yet the definition of GES includes reference to water transparency and dissolved oxygen. It is not clear whether changes in phytobenthos communities are included or not.

In addition, the set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 does not seem to cover all the different pressures and impacts related to Descriptor 5 identified in the initial assessment. Individual pressures require further clarification (e.g. river loads, direct coastal discharges atmospheric deposition, and autochthonous loads, vs. point and diffuse sources). The environmental targets avoid land-derived diffuse sources of nutrients. The apportionment of total nutrient/organic loads between individual pressures (sources) may not necessarily have an effect on the impacts observed (e.g. reduced dissolved oxygen concentration), but could affect the area(s) and feature impacted.

The set of targets will probably lead to a moderate/slight reduction in pressure, but not necessarily in impact. There will be considerable uncertainty in both pressure and impact assessments, as well as issues of ecosystem resilience. The relative stabilities of pelagic vs. benthic-dominated systems and issues of internal nutrient loading from historically nutrient-enriched sediments need to be considered, so any reduction in impacts is likely to be delayed and full recovery of degraded ecosystems is not necessarily guaranteed.

However, the targets established by Spain for eutrophication are probably not enough to achieve GES in those areas where nutrient levels are increasing and those identified as ‘potential eutrophication problem areas’. When other indicators are also monitored (in addition to those included in the initial assessment), it is possible that additional areas could also be judged to be under the threat of eutrophication e.g. impacts on phytobenthos communities are essentially unknown. The targets are only qualitative, but the thresholds for GES (some at least, e.g. nutrient concentrations) are quantitative. The relative importance of different pressures does not appear to have been fully considered in developing the targets, and for some indicators quantitative targets have not been developed.

North East Atlantic (Canary)
The assessment of eutrophication and its impacts is not consistent with the definition of GES. The assessment of trophic status is weak with regard to trophic status. No determination of organic loading has been undertaken, despites its relevance to indirect impacts (dissolved oxygen status) Nutrient levels within the sea have been assessed, as have chlorophyll levels, but no assessment of the level of impact on phytobenthos has been undertaken; neither have potential impacts on floral community composition been assessed.

The targets consider only point sources of nutrients (and by inference organic matter), and indirectly atmospheric deposition impacts, but without any targets for pressure reduction. The extent/type of ‘total pressure’ apportionment between individual sources is not clear. The initial assessment covered a reduced number of the potential impacts, referred to in the MSFD, the 2010 Commission Decision or Spain’s definition of GES. The one target dealing with pressure reduction is qualitative and is already covered by existing EU legislation, so the pressure should either have been dealt with or be in the process of being reduced.

It is not entirely clear if the set of targets and associated indicators defined for Descriptor 5 are sufficient to achieve GES. The targets themselves are rather weak, being qualitative and considering only two pressures. A first step should be to collect/collate the data for an informed and improved assessment of status, pressures and impacts. As such, it is, therefore, understandable why the targets are as restricted as they are. If GES for Descriptor 5 is currently being achieved, there should be no need for additional targets to ensure it remains at this level by 2020.";;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES at the criteria level and at the indicator level for criterion 6.1 but not for criterion 6.2. The Spanish GES definition states that the distribution area of biogenic and/or protected habitats remains table or increase. The use of “or” in the formulation creates uncertainty whether the distributional range of all biogenic habitats will have to be stable or increasing to achieve GES or only those which are protected. 

Regarding the condition of the habitats, the aim is for them to remain durable and functioning. This does not necessarily require positive or stable trends and could potentially allow for a degradation from the current state, as long as it does not endanger the overall functioning and existence of the associated characteristic and key species. With regard to the impacts of human activities, there is also the possibility for further degradation as long as it does not endanger the maintenance of the benthic habits. Allowing further degradation however is not in conflict with guidance from the 2010 Commission Decision. 

The Spanish GES also refers to benthic habitats, characteristic and key species while not clarifying which specific ecosystem components and which threshold values will be taken into account when assessing GES. For this reason, GES as it is currently defined is not operational and measurable. 

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Adequate; 3):

Habitats
The GES definitions for habitats are much less specific and detailed than those for the species for the North East Atlantic marine region (they are more specific for the Mediterranean – see section below). They do however cover the three criteria that are relevant for habitats in the Commission Decision (1.4, 1.5 and 1.6). Criterion 1.6 in particular is defined at indicator level. The definitions however are purely qualitative. Spain justifies the lack of quantification by mentioning the limited spatial and temporal data available and lack of defined methodologies. 

Spain explains that it cannot define its GES as being in line with ‘the reference level’ (or Favourable Reference Value, as defined by the JNCC, and related to the Favourable Conservation Status of the Habitats Directive). It justifies this by stating that it would not be realistic to expect a GES at this level considering a number of factors (e.g. irreversible loss of habitat, high social costs, long timescale for the recovery process, etc.). In addition, Spain introduces the concepts of ecosystem approach and sustainable use of the seas to justify deviation from the reference level.  This is in fact in line with the objective of the Habitats Directive, which allows for sustainable use and integrates the principle of “reference condition plus acceptable deviation”. It therefore proposes a stable (in relation to the current status) or increasing trend towards this reference level. However, Spain mentions that in case the habitat is subject to reference levels under another policy (e.g. the WFD or the Habitats Directive), these reference levels should be maintained to achieve GES. This is rather confusing considering that both the WFD and the Habitats Directive (as mentioned above) use the concept of “reference condition plus acceptable deviation” to define GEcS and Favourable Conservation Status.

In the paper report, it is not specified which habitats are covered by the GES definition. In the reporting sheet, Spain reports that it covers only seabed habitats which would mean that water column habitats are not at all covered by the GES definitions for D1. However, for the North subdivision, Spain provides a GES definition in relation to the structure of the planktonic community, which can be considered to be one indicator of the status of the water column. It is not clear why such indicator has not been used for the other subdivisions. ";The Spanish GES is partially adequate as it is in line with guidance from the 2010 Commission Decision except for not using the indicators for criterion 6.2. In order for the GES to become operational further elaboration is needed to conclude which values ensure that the durability, functioning and maintenance of the associated characteristic species and key species is maintained and which specific ecosystem components  will be evaluated. ;"- GES definition in line with Commission Decision at criteria level

Pressures (physical loss and damage) (Adequate, 3):

Spain has made a comprehensive assessment on the causes of physical loss and physical damage in both its subdivisions of the North East Atlantic. The data available on some particular sources of pressure were not considered sufficient (e.g. cables and pipelines) and therefore in some of these cases the information provided in the report relates to potential areas affected (e.g. the potentially draggable port area). It is also indicated that there is no information about the location of offshore mussel-breeding areas, the changes in turbidity that these may generate or the changes in sedimentation rates of particles these could introduce. Each type of pressure is addressed separately and the information – qualitative and quantitative – includes for most cases the total and relative dimension of the area impacted.  

Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast
The reporting sheets for the North subdivision are more complete than for the South subdivision as they include additional information on the features impacted, the proportion of the features impacted and a judgement on the level of pressure (although not in relation to GES). Apart from this, Spain has only mentioned some trends and did not make a definitive judgement on the level of impacts of physical loss and damage. On the other hand, and for both subdivisions, in the paper report Spain refers with more detail to impacts, mostly resulting from selected fishing activities, and gives some judgements in relation to GES. 

The main causes of physical loss differ in the two subdivisions – for the North, Spain refers to ports, dredging and solid waste disposal; for the South, Spain mentions land claim defences, ports and sand and gravel mining. It is reported that sand extraction is decreasing in the entire North East Atlantic region and the main areas where this source of pressure occur are listed for both subdivisions. General decreasing trends for port dredging in the South subdivision and for discharge of dredged materials in the North subdivision are also reported. While in the North the regeneration of beaches is not considered a problem, in the South it is reported that he number and length of regenerated beaches is high, and consequently so is the sediment volume provided for this purpose. The reporting sheets refer to one active platform for the extraction of hydrocarbons in the North and to three sub-sea wells for gas extraction in the South (which are described as affecting a very small area).

For the North subdivision, a status assessment is made in relation to the current level of pressure on the environment from physical loss – it is considered that the pressure “does not compromise the health of the environment” but it is acknowledged that it is not possible to make a definitive assessment since there is not a threshold GES/no GES. The habitats impacted are also listed and, although no judgement on the level of impact is made, it is indicated that criterion 6.2 has been analysed for a set of biogenic habitats. It is also reported that physical loss has impacts in less than 1% of the habitats. 

The main causes of physical damage are common to the entire region – fisheries, land claim defences and ports – while trawling is mentioned as the main pressure causing abrasion. The number of active dams as well as the average volume of water reserved is indicated for both subdivisions and it is reported that there is a clear trend of increase in the volume stored. 

In the case of the North subdivision, it is also indicated that criterion 6.2 has been analysed for a set of biogenic habitats, just like for physical loss, and the habitats and proportion of these impacted is also mentioned.

Canary Islands
The main causes of physical loss identified are ports and land claim defences, but sand extraction, cables and pipes, sealing structures, artificial reefs are also referred to. The current situation is not alarming in relation to most of these pressures, however, with regards to the regeneration of beaches some studies indicate that dunes can disappear as soon as in 80 years. The main causes of physical damage are also listed and include port infrastructures and defence, anchoring and stream flow retention. Spain indicates that most of these pressures are specific to areas near the shore. Trawling is currently forbidden in the Canary and there are no activities related to the extraction of hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, Spain has not reported any trends or made a judgement on the level of pressure from both physical loss and physical damage. Neither has specifically mentioned the features impacted.

Habitats
Spain has reported extensively on its seabed habitats but it has not reported on water column habitats. The list of habitats is based on the EUNIS classification but adapted to the regional characteristics of the sub-divisions. In the reporting sheets that have been reported on time, Spain has also reported using the MSFD predominant habitat type classification. In particular for the North subdivision of the NEA, Spain has reported on Littoral Rock, Littoral Sediment, Shallow Sand, Shallow Mud, Lower Bathyal Rock, Upper Bathyal Rock, Shallow Rock, Shallow Coarse Sediment, Shelf Sand, Shelf Mud, Shelf Coarse Sediment, Shelf Rock, Upper Bathyal Sediment, Lower Bathyal Sediment. It seems that Spain has not reported on water column habitats however it has reported on zooplankton and phytoplankton. In relation to Descriptor 6, only the biogenic habitats were considered, namely those included in OSPAR lists and in the Habitats Directive.

Spain refers extensively to the Habitats Directive. In addition, Spain reports on a number of special habitats noting that in certain cases these are protected under the Habitats Directive (e.g. Lagunas in the Levantino-Balear in the Western Mediterranean). However, Spain does not expressly indicate that the habitats listed in the Habitats Directive will be reported according to the timescale and format agreed under that Directive. OSPAR is also widely mentioned, including in relation to the habitats requiring special protection under this agreement (including among others Pennatulacea, sponge aggregations, Lophelia, maerl, coral gardens). The same is done in relation to the Barcelona Convention (including among others Dendropoma petraeum, Astroides caycularys, Corallina elongata, Pholas dactylus, Rissoella verrucosa).  

Where appropriate, the assessment of habitat types addresses both the abiotic (physical, hydrological, chemical) and biotic (community) aspects of each habitat. For each habitat reported, the habitat distribution, extent and condition have been described in (different levels of) detail and the main species associated listed. The information is qualitative and quantitative and numerous literary sources are cited. The criteria (1.4, 1.5 and 1.6) and indicators (1.4.1, 1.5.1, 1.6.1 and 1.6.2) used for the assessment are indicated and, in some cases, baselines and/or threshold values are also provided. However, only in very few cases trend status or definitive judgements assessing the current status are provided (in these cases the level of confidence on the assessment is provided as well). In the majority of the cases where this information is lacking, the justification provided by Spain is that there are currently no reference and/or threshold values GES/no GES.

A number of targets reported by Spain are mentioned as covering D1, 4 or 6 but actually relate more specifically to another descriptor (e.g. D2 or D3) and have therefore been assessed in the relevant sections of this report. But it should be kept in mind that biodiversity is covered by a large number of targets. 

An important number of targets are pressure- or impact-targets. They address specific activities, identified in the initial assessment as causing pressure on ecosystem components. The main pressures addressed by the targets include accidental or unwanted catches, bottom trawling and other anthropogenic activities such as dredging and aquaculture. 

The targets addressing these pressures are relatively general, using terms such as ‘reduce’, ‘maintain’ or ‘strengthen’ and are not further specified through threshold values or baselines. This means that the targets are not measurable. They are realistic and potentially achievable considering that they lack specific thresholds. They are also quite general in the sense that few targets refer to specific features. 

A number of targets relate to existing policies, networks, agreements and only recall the need for their implementation or their strengthening (e.g. Natura 2000, regulations on the commercial exploitation and by-catch of deep elasmobranchs). Another set of targets relate directly to maintain the status of species and habitats (distribution range, size, condition, etc.) These targets are quite general. They are quantified when they relate to specific thresholds described in the GES definition (e.g. Target A.3.5) or to specific indicators (e.g. Target A.3.1).  

A large number of the targets are also knowledge targets to increase knowledge on ecosystems or ecosystem components (e.g. deep sea habitats). 
";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of targets and indicators defined by Spain for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 is considered partially adequate. The targets cover the set of descriptors but lack references to specific methods of implementation and references to target states. The set of targets that relate to the status of species and habitats clearly lack ambition as they all relate to maintaining current status. While the proposed measures for increasing information availability and monitoring activities are commendable, the lack of specification regarding their implementation make it uncertain that they will be sufficient to support achieving GES by 2020. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

- Large number of targets defined
- Mostly pressure- or impact- targets addressing specific activities
- General terms used e.g. “reduce”, “maintain”
- No thresholds/baselines defined
- Several targets relate to the implementation of existing agreements
- Several targets related to increasing knowledge and monitoring but lack of specific timeline to make them useful to achieve GES.

Spain (North East Atlantic);D6;Consistency ;;"The GES definition for Descriptor 1 has been defined at a high level of detail while the GES definitions for Descriptors 4 and 6 have been kept more succinct. Descriptors 4 and 6 follow more closely the Commission Decision while Descriptor 1 follows rather the structure from the initial assessment. This choice for defining Descriptor 1 according to the structure of the initial assessment has resulted in GES for specific habitats being defined under Descriptor 1 rather than Descriptor 6. 

For the Western Mediterranean a number of specific habitats are included in the GES definition while no specific habitats are mentioned for the North East Atlantic region. For the Canary subdivision Spain has also not adopted a GES definition for fish and invertebrates which is not consistent with the GES for the other regions. It should also be noted that each of the GES definitions allows either implicitly or explicitly for potential future degradation of the ecosystem. Furthermore some of the GES definitions would be more appropriately reported under Article 10 targets. 

The Initial assessment done by Spain is very extensive and reported on pressures and features in great detail. This has led to very specific GES definitions for birds but less so for other ecosystem components such as mammals, fish and habitats.  The state targets defined under Article 10 refer even less to specific ecosystem components and instead remain very general, therefore it does not seem that Spain has made full use of their initial assessment when setting the Artice 10 state and pressure targets. In general Spain has reported in a lot of detail for biodiversity but from the information provided it remains unclear for most ecosystem components (except maybe birds) at which point exactly GES and the targets are achieved.






";;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor level. However the definition clearly integrates the two criteria of the Commission Decision on the spatial characterization of alterations and impacts on ecosystem components. The definition is the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report and is applicable to all sub-divisions of the two Spanish marine regions: the North East Atlantic and the Western Mediterranean. 

The definition of GES includes a reference to space, but in a relatively vague way. There is a lack of specificity as to what is meant with “some zones” and “small size”. Habitats and functions potentially impacted are not clearly specified (although mention is made to biogenic and protected habitats). 

OSPAR advice (relevant only for the North East Atlantic marine region) is partially used in relation to parameters, habitats and species but there is no reference to the appropriate WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters.";The GES definition of Spain for D7 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition could have been more specific, particularly on scale of changes (time and space) and on species/habitats to be considered for assessing GES for this indicator (they are cited in paper reports for the environmental targets). The definition provided is not specific enough to judge when GES is achieved or if it has been maintained. ;"- GES is defined at descriptor level but encompasses both criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision
- Not specific enough on scale of changes or species/habitats
- No clear link to the WFD";2;Partially adequate 
Spain (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain has carried out initial assessments for hydrographical alterations for all three sub-divisions of the North Atlantic (although in the reporting sheets only the initial assessment for the sub-division North can be found). The lack of knowledge and the need to optimize the existing monitoring programmes is acknowledged and the usefulness of the results of environmental impact assessments to have a better overview of the problem is mentioned.

The assessments – mainly of qualitative nature – describe separately the hydrographical changes at large scale, at local and intermediate scale, and refer briefly to changes in the functioning of ecosystems. Some specific projects and/or activities causing hydrographical changes are indicated. The increase in water temperature is indicated as the main problem for all three sub-divisions. The assessments carried out seem to be consistent with OSPAR QSR for pressures, summary and impacts in the respective areas. All three sub-divisions are considered to be already at GES.";The initial assessment of Spain for hydrographical alterations is assessed as partially adequate. The analysis of pressures/impacts and relation with large scale changes is good, given the existing knowledge and the plans described to address the gaps.  However, the description of habitats potentially affected by changes is not complete and no trend is provided. The judgement on current status (area at GES) is not supported by relevant information, particularly considering possible trends related to some pressures reported.;"- Good information on pressures and impacts but mainly qualitative
- Limited assessment of the habitats assessed
- The judgement that GES is achieved does not seem to reflect the real situation";2;Partially adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined six environmental targets and five associated indicators to address Descriptor 7.  The targets are the same in reporting sheets and in the paper report and apply to all sub-divisions of the two Spanish marine regions. 

Most of the proposed environmental targets are potentially measurable, achievable and realistic; on the other hand, they are quite general and not time-bound. In addition, they do not provide specific threshold or reference value for the indicators. 

Targets C2.1 and C2.2 address permanent physical changes rather than permanent hydrographical changes. The permanent hydrographical changes addressed under D7 are however often the result of permanent physical changes which makes these targets relevant although not specific to Descriptor 7. Target C2.3 is the only specific pressure target for Descriptor 7 which is to implement mitigation measures to ensure that changes to hydrographical conditions from permanent human induced changes do not endanger the conservation status of habitats. Targets C2.3, C2.4 and C2.5 are targets to ensure that hydrographical changes are considered in the planning stages of various projects affecting the marine environment. The final target is a broad monitoring target for hydrographical changes at a large scale. 

The targets as a set are probably sufficiently ambitious to reduce pressures and impacts to levels that achieve GES (although some are not specific enough: scale, pressure, concerned habitats…). Overall, the targets are consistent as a set and they cover a very wide scope (monitoring, surveillance, information, participation, coordination, EIA).";"The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Spain for D7 is assessed as adequate. The targets provided are quite generic (only target C2.3 is specific to Descriptor 7) and not specific to the various geographical areas. A few targets are related to decreasing pressure levels and subsequently impacts on ecosystem components. Indicators are described, but no threshold value is provided. The targets cover a very wide spectrum; some are not directly related to GES, but if efficiently implemented they can indeed contribute to achieving/maintaining GES (in particular Target C.2.4).";"- Consistent and comprehensive set of targets
- Most of the targets are potentially measurable, achievable and realistic even if quite general and lack thresholds
- Good link to existing regulatory regimes
- Probably sufficiently enough to achieve GES";3;Adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D7;Consistency ;;The assessment of the permanent hydrographical changes and their impacts is consistent with the Spanish definition of GES for D7, but this occurs because the definition of GES is not specific enough. Therefore the judgement that the current status is at GES is actually consistent with GES definition. The environmental targets and associated indicators are very general and cover a very wide scope, which should include all potential pressures (coastal projects). On the other hand, even if potential indicators are listed no values are given. In any case, this set of targets will probably lead to a reduction in the identified pressures and impacts. Finally, considering that all areas are currently at GES, the targets provided for Spain for permanent hydrographical changes are probably sufficient to maintain GES.;;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"North and South divisions
Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 8 for its North Atlantic subdivisions at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper reports. However the definition at descriptor level incorporates the criteria of the Commission Decision, concentration and effects of contaminants. 

The method defined by Spain for the definition of the GES is described in the definition itself, reported above, and further specified in the accompanying text. Even though the definition is actually longer, it can be considered that the restricted definition of GES for Spain is: “It is considered that an area is at GES if the large majority of its samples do not exceed the levels established by the competent authorities and regional bodies and when the trend over time is descending or stable (for those cases in which the detected level is very close to the baseline level).”

Spain defines the threshold value which will determine whether an area is or not at GES (“the large majority of its samples”): 95% of samples in the area should be below the agreed levels (T1). Spain justifies not setting a threshold of 100% of samples by mentioning that it is the first time that chemical and biological data will be integrated to measure achievement of a standard and referring to an ICES recommendation. In addition, Spain includes a clause in its definition that this threshold can be reviewed “afterwards” (presumably meaning before 2020) to take account of new discussions at international level and the outcome of future monitoring. Spain acknowledges a number of limitations in the methodology it has put in place and one of these is the fact that the initial assessment, which is strongly linked to the definition of GES, has been done mostly in coastal waters.  Spain explains that this is not such a problem because coastal waters are likely to be the most polluted ones, however, it does call into question the use of the 95% threshold, set taking into account the highest impacted areas in the Spanish marine waters. If the objective of 2020 is to measure GES in both coastal and offshore waters, the number of samples will increase substantially from the mostly coastal samples used for the IA. In this case, the threshold of 95% of all aggregated areas will be easier to reach, in particular because the additional samples (in offshore waters) are more likely to be below the agreed levels. Spain mentions that the threshold value of 95% is initial and might be reviewed but does not clearly state that it will be reviewed in order to take account of offshore areas. 

Spain does add a condition that the trend over time is descending or stable. This ensures that the current state should not degrade even if it remains below the threshold value. However it is not clear what the baseline to measure this trend. It would make sense that the baseline used is the current state of the marine waters but this is not clear. 

The “international environmental quality criteria derived from the law or proposed at regional level by international agreements”, or T1 as they are referred to in the Spanish definition, cover OSPAR’s Environmental Assessment Criteria, the ERLs (Effects Range Low) from the American Environmental Protection Agency and the foodstuffs limit values defined in Regulation 1881/2006, which Spain uses in the case of concentrations of heavy metals in biota (as per the OSPAR QSR approach). This is consistent with the methodology applied for the initial assessment. 

The EU EQS are not included in the GES definition. In the initial assessment, which is strongly linked to the definition of GES, Spain refers to the EQSD and the regular monitoring that needs to be done under the WFD. It mentions that while EQS are defined to measure concentrations of substances in water, only three are defined for substances in biota (Hg, HCB, hexachlorobutadiene). Because of the large spatial and temporal variability of contaminant levels in coastal water bodies and because of the accumulation of hydrophobe contaminants in biota and sediment, Spain considers that these are more appropriate matrices for measurement of contaminant levels than water. 

Concentration of contaminants
Spain does not provide the list of the substances covered by the GES definition although considering the strong links between the definition of GES and the initial assessment, it can be inferred that the substances covered in the GES definition are those assessed for the initial assessment. In the accompanying text to the definition, in the reporting sheet, Spain mentions that the contaminants selected (presumably for the GES definition) are those from the OSPAR Convention. There is a lack of clarity regarding those priority substances that are included in the EQSD but not under the OSPAR Convention. 

The matrices in which the substances should be measured are also not clearly specified in the definition. In the accompanying text to the definition, in the reporting sheet, Spain evokes the matrices used for the initial assessment, sediments and wild mussels, which it says are the most used ones within the national surveillance programmes throughout Europe and are recommended by OSPAR’s CEMP approach. It would be logical to infer that these are the two matrices, which should be used to measure GES. 

For concentration of contaminants, Spain has defined its baselines, T0, using OSPAR’s BAC (Background Assessment Criteria) in order to distinguish between contaminants that are below or at the baseline level (C < T0), those that are between the baseline and the threshold levels (T0< C <T1) and those that are above the threshold value (C > T1).

Effects of contaminants
It is presumed that the Spanish definition of GES covers the second criterion of the Commission Decision, effects of contaminants. It can be inferred from the definition of the baseline, which sets baselines for biological effects and refers to OSPAR’s EcoQO on imposex. It is also mentioned in the last part of the GES definition added only for the North East Atlantic region that the criteria to be used for “contaminants and biological effects” are OSPAR’s. The exact biological effects addressed in the GES definition are not listed, but considering the strong links with the initial assessment, it can be inferred that the biological effects for the GES would be the same as those assessed for the initial assessment, including EROD activity, metallothioneins, micronucleus frequency in gill cells, lysosomal membrane stability, stress on stress response and acetylcholinesterase activity in the gills in addition to imposex. 

For effects of contaminants, Spain has defined its baselines using a baseline response rate (RRB), derived from the responses in organisms inhabiting clean sites or minimally impacted by chemical, the high response rate (RRE), which is the expected response in organisms living in places where the impact of chemical pollutants is possible, and the highest response rate (RRA), defined as the expected response in organisms inhabiting places where the impact is likely contaminants. 

Acute pollution events do not seem to be covered by the GES definition for D8. There is no reference to the effects of contamination by oil pollution. 

Canary

Spain has not defined a GES for this region. It states that it is not possible to define GES for this subdivision because of lack of knowledge. It provides detailed information on what the gaps are but does not provide a clear plan to define GES for this region. It only states that if enough information was available, GES would be defined very similar to the other two regions: “It is considered that an area is in GES if the large majority of its samples do not exceed the levels established by the competent authorities and regional bodies and when the trends over time are descending or are stable (for those cases in which the detected level is very close to the base level).”";The definition of GES for D8 for the North East Atlantic marine region is considered partially adequate. GES is defined at criteria level and is specific, detailed and measurable however Spain has not defined GES for acute pollution events. Spain has described the methodology to be used to establish that a subdivision is at GES or not. The methodology is based on internationally agreed standards, mainly OSPAR’s EACs and also the American ERLs and the EU food contamination standards but not the EQS. Spain justifies not using the EQS for the definition of GES because they are not measured in an appropriate matrix for the marine environment. It should be noted that while OSPAR’s EAC are risk-based (similarly to the EU EQS) and more tailored to marine water assessments than the EQS, the EU requires (also in the new proposal on hazardous substances) that EAC provide an equivalent protection to that  provided by the EQSD.  ;"- GES defined at criteria level but coverage of criterion 8.2 only partial (no coverage of acute pollution events)
- Use of OSPAR EAC and EcoQOs as reference levels
- Justification provided for not using the EQS considered sufficient
- Definition of aggregation rules is considered a good practice (+++)
";2;Partially adequate 
Spain (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Spain reports to a similar level of details for all five subdivisions, using the same methodology to make an assessment of the current levels of and impacts from the contamination pressure.

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Spain has made a comprehensive assessment of contamination by synthetic and non-synthetic substances. Contaminants are described in two different places for each marine subdivision: in the paper report on pressures and in the report on Descriptor 8. In the report on pressures, Spain provides a qualitative and quantitative description of contamination by hazardous substances through the angle of accidental/uncontrolled input and voluntary/controlled input.

In the first category, Spain includes accidental spills from ships, riverine inputs, atmospheric depositions and runoffs. In the second category, it includes discharges of liquids (e.g. from industrial sources or wastewater discharges) and solid discharges (e.g. of contaminated sediments from dredging). For each of these sources of contamination, Spain provides a description of the level of contamination, supported by a number of graphs, maps and tables. The lengths of the descriptions vary from one subdivision to another but remain comparable. The substances described include both non-synthetic and synthetic substances. Spain refers to OSPAR and to the Water Framework Directive. Spain also provides a description of the cumulative pressures in various areas of the marine subdivisions. To do this, it has established a list of criteria to determine the areas that are at risk of contamination from different sources (e.g. areas that are less than 500 m from any authorized location for the dumping of dredged material). It then establishes a formula to determine the areas that are most at risk and those least at risk and maps the results.  

In the report on D8, Spain provides its methodology for the assessment of the current level of and impacts from the contamination pressure. Ultimately the methodology is that used for the definition of Good Environmental Status. Spain provides what it considers to be the reference values for the contaminants described in the pressures & impacts reports, to be used for the assessment. As described in the section on GES, the reference values used for the assessment are OSPAR’s EACs and the American ERLs for certain biological effects for both the NEA and the Mediterranean marine regions. These reference values are referred to as T1. The substances assessed include heavy metals (mercury, cadmium, lead), PAHs, PCBs and OCPs. The matrices in which these substances should be measured vary from one division to another. In the North subdivision of the NEA and in the Canary isles, the matrices used are the wild mussels and superficial sediments. In the South subdivision of NEA, only sediments are used for the measurements.  In the two Mediterranean subdivisions, the matrices selected are the mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and the mullet (Mullus barbatus) for biota and superficial sediments. The biological effects measured include EROD, GST, GPx, AChE and SFG. In certain subdivisions (e.g. North of NEA), imposex is also included. The species in which these effects are measured are also listed and vary from one subdivision to another. 

Both OSPAR CEMP and MED POL are referred to in all reports but, logically, OSPAR CEMP is mostly used in the NEA subdivisions while MED POL is extensively referred to for the Mediterranean subdivisions. For both marine regions however the background values used to set the baseline T0 are OPSAR’s background concentrations (BAC). 

Spain then sets to assess the current levels of contamination in the marine waters and the biological effects from this contamination. The assessment is quantitative, using both quantitative trends (spatial and temporal) and actual values. A number of maps illustrate the extent and distribution of the pressure. In OSPAR waters, the 2010 Quality Status Report is often referred to. Spain makes a final, aggregated judgement on the level of and impact from the contamination pressure at the level of the subdivision, using the T0 and T1 reference values (except for Canary, for which no judgement is made). The judgement is based on three criteria: concentrations of contaminants (all contaminants aggregated together), exposure indicators and biological effects (the exposure indicators are not used in the South subdivision of NEA).   

In terms of limitations and knowledge gaps, Spain mentions that the data available for Descriptor 8 is essentially limited to the coastal band (until 20 miles offshore) and therefore that there is a gap regarding the contamination of offshore waters. Spain also mentions that additional substances should be included for environmental monitoring (and therefore for assessment of GES) and additional biological effects should be measured. For the Mediterranean region, Spain acknowledges that one priority is to define background concentrations and reference values specific to the Mediterranean region (inspired by OSPAR but taking into account the specificities of the region and of the marine activities taking place there). In the Mediterranean reports, Spain provides a detailed account of its plans to address the gaps highlighted (spatial and gaps in coverage of substances and biological effects), including coordination among agencies and with neighbouring countries.

Radionuclides
In the reports on pressures, Spain provides a description of contamination by radionuclides. It describes the sources of contamination (e.g. Vandellós II Nuclear Power Plant in Levantino-Balear) and describes the monitoring programmes set up by the Council for Nuclear Safety and provides the results of these measurements for three indices (alpha radiation activity, beta radiation activity and tritium specific activity). Spain also mentions that concentrations of 137Cs have been found to be similar to those from other sampling stations in Europe. Reference is made to the Euratom treaty. 

No assessment of current levels of contamination is made in the D8 reports. No assessment is made of the impacts on ecosystem components. No information is provided on gaps and future plans. 

Acute pollution events
Contamination by acute pollution events is described in the pressures reports in the section on accidental spills. Spain provides a table of the number of collisions and other types of accidents causing spills and maps of where these have been taking place in the subdivisions. It provides a quantitative description of the volumes of the spills and the substances spilled with graphs showing the input loads for various geographical areas from 2005 to 2009 of crude oil, refined petroleum products, coal and coke and chemicals (not clear what these are). 

Spain acknowledges that there is very little information regarding the effects of acute pollution events (accidental oil spills, etc.), which hampers the assessment of its impact on the environment. 

In the D8 reports, Spain makes an assessment of the biological effects caused by oil discharges (corresponding to indicator 8.2.2 of the Commission Decision). After describing the relevant acute pollution events, Spain provides a semi-quantitative assessment of the species impacted. The analysis is limited and non-conclusive with regard to the current status (which is consistent with the lack of GES definition for indicator 8.2.2). ";The initial assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events of the marine waters of Spain is considered adequate. Spain describes the various sources of contamination, assesses contamination by synthetic and non-synthetic substances using internationally recognized standards and assesses biological effects on biota. Its final aggregated judgement on the level of and impact from the contamination pressure in all subdivision (expect Canary) is clearly related to the methodology used to assess GES. Spain refers to both OSPAR and MED POL and acknowledges the gaps in the Mediterranean with regard to background concentrations and reference values. It also acknowledges gaps in the spatial coverage of its assessment and provides limited information on its future plans to address these gaps. ;"- Detailed description of sources of contamination

Spain (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined eight targets to cover D8 but only five of them have been defined specifically for D8. Among the other three, one addresses wastewater discharges (B.1.1) and is also linked to the other pollution descriptors D5, D9 and D10 in addition to D8. The second one, B.1.2, relates to wastewater discharges into the sea from vessels and platforms and is also linked to D9 in addition to D8. The last one, C.3.5, is a general target on increasing knowledge on the pollution effects on ecosystem components. It is also linked to Descriptors 1, 6 and 10. 

Each target is associated with an indicator. No threshold values have been defined for the first two targets on wastewater discharges. These are pressure-based targets geared towards reducing discharges from human activities. Baselines however have been defined as the present situation (2012). The two targets, based on reducing trends, can be considered potentially measurable but the lack of threshold value means that it is not possible to determine if they are achievable and to which extent they will help achieve GES. In addition, the second part of Target B.1.1 on improving the efficiency of the various plans is not at all measurable and specific. 

Targets B.2.1, B.2.2 and B.2.3 are directly related to the GES definition. They cover Criterion 8.1 of the Commission Decision (concentration of contaminants in biota and sediments) and the first indicator of Criterion 8.2 (biological effects). For these three targets, Spain mentions that the threshold values and baselines for these targets are those defined for GES. It can be assumed that all the other parameters for these targets are the same as those described for the GES definition. As such the targets are specific and measurable. The achievement of the target would definitely lead to GES considering that the targets are rather an expression of GES than designed to assess progress to GES.  

In addition, Target B.2.4 covers the second indicator of Criterion 8.2 on acute pollution events. The target is very close to the OSPAR-defined target for acute pollution events. No threshold or baseline have been defined for this target which is as such not very specific or measurable. 

Thresholds and baselines have not been defined for the last two targets on increasing knowledge but this is not as important as for other targets considering that these targets are not really operational.";The set of targets and associated indicators defined by Spain to cover Descriptor 8 is considered as partially adequate. All targets are potentially measurable and are associated with specific indicators. However, only three of them are quantified through the definition of threshold values and baselines but they are rather an expression of GES than targets designed to assess progress to GES. The other targets are quite generic and without threshold values.  ;"- Targets are potentially measurable and have associated indicators

Spain (North East Atlantic);D8;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the level of and impacts from the contamination pressure is consistent with the definition of GES. The judgements made on the current status use the same reference levels and background concentrations as those referred to in the GES definition. No final assessment has been made on contamination of radionuclides and acute pollution events, which is reflected in the lack of GES characteristics for these two aspects.

The set of targets and indicators is also consistent with the initial assessment considering that it is quite general and does not cover specific pressures or substances. However the knowledge targets are not really related to the gaps identified in the initial assessment on the lack of information on offshore areas. No target has been developed that relates to the need to develop reference values and background concentrations for the Mediterranean region. ";;;;
Spain (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Spain has defined GES for Descriptor 9 for its marine waters at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper reports. However the definition integrates Criterion 9.1 and addresses both indicators (9.1.1 on the levels of contaminants and number of contaminants that have exceeded the maximum regulatory levels and 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded). 

The method defined by Spain for the definition of the Good Environmental Status (GES) is described thoroughly in the definition itself, reported above, and further specified in the accompanying text. The application of integration levels originates from the recommendation by the Task Group report on Descriptor 9 (Swartenbroux et al., 2010), which acknowledges that the “one out, all out” rule may not apply in the case of contaminants in fish and seafood. 

Threshold values are clearly defined (VU1a, VU1b, VU2 and VU3). Baselines are also defined and this is where Spain specifies that the reference levels for the definition of GES are those defined in Regulation 1881/2006 (and its relevant amendments). Spain discusses the special case of seaweed, regulated through Regulation 629/2008, and the necessity to adapt the maximum level of cadmium to account for the fact that cadmium is naturally accumulating in seaweed. 

Spain does not provide an exhaustive list of species and substances covered by the GES. 

The substances are presumably all those addressed by Regulation 1881/2006. In addition, considering the strong link between the definition of the GES and the initial assessment, it is considered that the substances covered by the GES definition are at least those addressed by the IA. For all subdivisions, the following substances have been assessed: heavy metals (Cd, Hg and Pb), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BaP and S4HAPs) and organohalogen compounds (dioxins, DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs). 

As for the species, considering the strong link between the definition of the GES and the initial assessment, it is considered that the species covered by GES are at least those addressed by the IA and should cover at least the following groups: fish, crustaceans, shellfish and cephalopods. The species and number of species assessed vary from one subdivision to another (with a maximum number of species in the North East Atlantic northern subdivision to a minimum number of species in the Canary subdivision). 

Spain notes a number of limitations which hinder the assessment of current status and would need to be addressed in order to assess GES by 2020. These include:
-	Number of pollutants evaluated (there is no information of all legislated pollutants)
-	Current levels (most data refer to samples the years 2001-2005)
-	Total number of species for human consumption 
-	Catch areas demarcation (no detailed information on fisheries / specific sampling stations within the river) 
However, Spain does not present plans to address these knowledge and data gaps. ";The definition of GES for D9 for its marine waters is considered adequate. GES is defined at criteria level and is specific, detailed and measurable. Spain has described the methodology to be used to establish that a subdivision is at GES or not. The methodology is based on compliance with Regulation 1881/2006.  ;"- GES is defined at criteria level

Spain (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"North and South subdivisions
Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Spain provides an assessment of contamination of fish and shellfish by hazardous substances for the two marine subdivisions (north and south) it has defined in this marine subdivision. For both subdivisions, Spain explains that the assessment has been done using the OSPAR JAMP methodology. It also explains that most of the assessment has been done in coastal waters. Finally, it states that the assessment has mostly looked at the concentrations of heavy metals. But a number of synthetic substances have also been assessed, as mentioned in the section above. Overall, for the NEA marine region, the substances assessed are heavy metals (Cd, Hg and Pb), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BaP and S4HAPs) and organohalogen compounds (dioxins, DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs). 

In the North subdivision, Spain has made an assessment of concentrations of heavy metals in 16 species of fish, 3 species of crustaceans, 9 species of bivalves and 5 species of cephalopods. In the South, it has made an assessment of the concentrations of heavy metals in 9 species of fish, 2 species of crustaceans and 2 species of cephalopods.

In the reporting sheet, Spain also provides an indication in the reporting sheet of the activities causing the pressure (industry and ports) but as these are the same as for contamination by hazardous substances in general, it is unsure whether they also apply to contamination of fish and seafood. In the paper report, Spain indicates that the main activities causing the pressure include large industrial centres, large populated areas and shipping.

In the reporting sheet, Spain assesses that 1-5% of assessed fish and seafood samples in the North subdivision exceed regulatory levels. It should be noted that Spain has not reported in the reporting sheet on contamination of fish and seafood for the South subdivision. Therefore a similar assessment has not been made for this area and the information was not found in the paper report. 

In the reporting sheets for both subdivisions Spain makes a positive judgement on the impacts of contamination on fish and seafood in relation to GES, explaining that most commercial species for human consumption caught in the North East Atlantic marine region show no pollutant concentration levels that exceed allowable limits (except the scallop). This is not completely in line with the comment made by Spain in the paper report that it cannot be determined whether any of the two subdivisions is at GES because of uncertainties related to the number and type of contaminants to be assessed for each species considered. In the paper report, some information is provided for certain species (e.g. for scallops, more than 5% of studied specimens exceed the regulatory levels for Pb, BaP and S4HAPs) but it is not aggregated into a final judgement related to GES. 

Spain provides a detailed account of the gaps in knowledge and data, in relation to the insufficient number of species and substances monitored and the spatial coverage of the monitoring, in particular in relation to offshore waters. It also provides information on its plans to address these gaps although these are not very specific on deadlines and responsibilities. However the targets might also address these gaps. 

Microbial pathogens
Spain has assessed microbial pathogens but the information is rather limited. It refers to the Bathing Water Directive and the Shellfish Directive. The main pressures identified are urban wastewater treatment (1) and tourism (2). In the reporting sheet, there is no data on pressure and impacts. In the paper report, Spain has assessed pressures at a general level and has carried out a risk analysis of potential entry points of microbial pathogens. The factors considered are wastewater discharges, aquaculture facilities and shellfish areas, bathing areas and rivers (wastewater inputs). Spain notes that no other data is available to assess microbial pathogens and recommends to fill this information gap in future assessments with data from monitoring programmes for coastal discharges.


Canary subdivision
It should be noted that Spain has not reported in the reporting sheets on the contamination of fish and seafood for the Canary subdivision. The information assessed comes from the paper report. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
Spain provides a more limited assessment of contamination of fish and shellfish by hazardous substances than for the other subdivisions but based the same methodology.

As for the other two subdivisions, the assessment is supposed to be done for heavy metals (Cd, Hg and Pb), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BaP and S4HAPs) and organohalogen compounds (dioxins, DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs) in three species, red mullet, sardine and the common bleak. In fact, the assessment of actual concentrations is done only for heavy metals. Spain explains that no information is available on the levels of regulated organic coumpounds and PAHs in marine organisms in this area. The main activities causing the pressure are reported to be industries, shipping and villages.

In terms of judgement, as for the other two subdivisions, Spain does not make an aggregated judgement on the current concentrations of contaminants in fish and seafood because of the lack of data on many commercial species. It does not even provide judgements on individual species or individual substances.  

For this subdivision, Spain acknowledges that there are important limitations with regard to available data for the assessment on the number of species studied, the levels of regulated contaminants and the spatial and temporal coverage of the assessment because of the lack of monitoring programme. In terms of future plans, Spain only mentions the necessity to put in place a monitoring programme through the coordination of various local, regional and national agencies. It also highlights the necessity to increase traceability of fishery products. 

Microbial pathogens
The reporting sheet indicates that the main pressures, urban and tourism/recreation. It also notes that the state of the marine waters in relation to microbial pathogens have been evaluated on the basis of the Bathing Water Directive assessment. There are no shellfish waters in this sub-region. The reporting sheet does not include any additional data. In the paper report, the level of description is comparable to what is provided for the sub-region Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast.";The initial assessment of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances and microbial pathogens of the North East Atlantic marine region of Spain is considered adequate.  Spain has put in place a sound methodology for the assessment of current concentration levels on fish and seafood directly related to its methodology for the definition of GES. It makes a judgement on the current situation in relation to GES in the reporting sheet but not in the paper report. It acknowledges the knowledge and data gaps (in particular with regard to spatial coverage) and proposes limited plans to address these. The assessment for the Canary subdivision is more limited considering gaps in knowledge. ;"- Detailed assessment using OSPAR JAMP methodology

Spain (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Spain has defined four targets and associated indicators to cover D9. Only two however are specific for D9 as the first target, on wastewater discharges has been defined to cover all pollution descriptors (D5, D8, D9 and D10) and the second target, on wastewater discharges from vessels and platforms, is said to cover both D8 and D9. 

No threshold values have been defined for the first two targets on wastewater discharges. These are pressure-based targets geared towards reducing discharges from human activities. Baselines for these two targets have been defined as the present situation (2012). The two targets, based on reducing trends, can be considered potentially measurable but the lack of threshold value means that it is not possible to determine if they are achievable and to which extent they will help achieve GES. In addition, the second part of Target B.1.1 on improving the efficiency of the various plans is neither measurable nor specific. 

Target B.2.5 is directly related to the GES definition for Descriptor 9. It addresses only part of criterion 9.1 however, level of contaminants, and does not address the frequency of levels being exceeded. It is not clear how the target relates to the 3-level aggregation methodology put in place by Spain for D9. Defined as it is, the target seems to apply a “all in, all out” rule (“no exceedance of regulatory levels”) but it does refer to the methodology set up for the definition of GES for its threshold value and baseline. The target also refers to “other requirements for the protection of human health” but it is not clear what this refers to, especially considering that only Regulation 1881/2006 (and amendments) is considered for the GES definition and the initial assessment. The target seems very general and not corresponding to the complex methodology put in place by Spain to define GES for D9. The achievement of the target would definitely lead to GES considering that it is more ambitious (no deviation from reference levels). 

The last target is directly linked to data and knowledge gaps identified in the IA and the definition of GES. It is specific and measurable but no threshold value or baseline has been defined, which makes it less useful. The objective of the target is to collect information currently missing on the origin of fisheries product in order to be able to integrate such parameter into the definition of GES. The target therefore is not geared towards achieving GES but rather improving upon it. ";The set of target and indicator defined by Spain to cover Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. All targets are potentially measurable and are associated with specific indicators. There is a lack of consistency between Target B.2.5 and the GES definition. The other targets are quite generic and without threshold values, which would have helped to monitor their achievement. ;"- Potentially measurable
- Lack of threshold values/baselines 
- Lack of consistency between target B.2.5 and GES definition
- Target to improve traceability";2;Partially adequate
Spain (North East Atlantic);D9;Consistency ;;"There is very strong consistency between the assessment of the current level of contamination of fish and seafood and the definition of GES. The initial assessment reflects the relevant substances covered by EU legislation and, depending on the subdivision the relevant, species covering the four main groups included in the GES definition (fish, shellfish, crustaceans, cephalopods).

The two environment targets defined specifically for D9 are consistent with the initial assessment in the sense that they cover the relevant legislation and presumably the same substances and species. The last target also relates to the issue of traceability, which has been highlighted has an important issue for all subdivisions. The first two targets are consistent with the initial assessment to the extent that the IA mentions the issue of wastewater from urban and industrial areas. 

As explained in the assessment of adequacy of the targets, Target B.2.5 is inconsistent with the GES definition. The rest of the targets are quite generic and therefore it is not possible to assess whether they will be sufficient to achieve GES. ";;;;
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at the level of the descriptor, the criteria and the indicators. It covers all criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision and most of the indicators. The indicators that are not addressed in the definition include 1.1.2 (distributional pattern), 1.1.3 (area covered by species), 1.3.2 (genetic structure), 1.4.1 (distributional range), 1.4.2 (distributional pattern), 1.5.2 (habitat volume), 1.6.3 (physical, hydrological and chemical conditions). It should be noted that a number of indicators have not been reported in the reporting sheets (for either region) and are only present in the paper reports (1.2D, 1.3E, 1.6A and 1.6B). 

Species/functional groups
According to the reporting sheets, the species groups covered by criteria 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 for both marine regions are birds, mammals and fish. No reference is made to cephalopods or reptiles. However, it is expected that these are not relevant for the Baltic and most likely not relevant for the North Sea area. In addition, Sweden has defined a number of indicators focusing on specific species, including the harbour porpoise for the North Sea and for both regions seals and wintering waterfowls. The “mammals” indicator (1.3D) focuses specifically on the harbour porpoise and seal for the North Sea and the grey seal, the ringed seal and the harbour seal in the Baltic Sea. Seabirds and fish are further covered globally by indicators 1.2C (seabirds) and 1.2D and 1.3E (fish). 

In terms of threshold values or baselines (for trend-based indicators), only a few indicators have been further specified in the reporting sheets and the paper report. The majority of indicators do not have specific thresholds or baselines defined to be used as GES boundaries. For indicators 1.2B and 1.2C, Sweden proposes a defined list of species to be used as indicators for the Baltic Sea. However no baseline is defined to be able to measure GES. Sweden acknowledges that most of these indicators are not functional in 2012 and will be either in 2014 for the Baltic Sea (if they are developed under the HELCOM CORESET) or 2018 for the North Sea. 

Only for the white-tailed eagle (in the Baltic Sea) and seals does Sweden provide quantitative thresholds and baselines based on the HELCOM CORESET project (indicator 1.3A: breeding success > 60%, aerie size > 1.64 young and productivity > 1.0 young; indicator 1.3B: Grey seal: blubber thickness for females and males 1-3 years = 26 mm, males 5-20 years = 36 mm, females 5-20 years = 37 mm; and indicator 1.3C: grey seals: gestation frequency > 80%; harbour seal and ringed seal: TBD). The baselines are also specified for these three indicators (for the white-tailed eagle, either the 2004 stocks from the Environmental Protection Agency or the 2012 HELCOM CORESET and for the seals the 2012 HELCOM CORESET). No threshold or baseline is specified for indicator 1.3C for the North Sea which is explained by the fact that, according to the paper report, indicator 1.3C in the North Sea covers only the harbour seal and the indicator will be operational only in 2018. For the Baltic Sea, indicator 1.3C covers both the grey seal (operational in 2012) and the harbour seal (operational only in 2018).

In the paper report, possible threshold values are provided for indicator 1.3D on the growth rate for marine mammals (more specifically of grey seals and ringed seals populations, in relation to the ecosystem’s carrying capacity). The values are based on HELCOM but apply to both regions. The indicator is still under development anyway. Finally, the size/biomass of fish species is also covered by criterion 1.6 on the condition of the typical species and communities.

In general the baseline is understood in the sense of ‘reference condition’, i.e. in line with prevailing conditions, within the range of ‘natural conditions’ or in such a state that long term survival and reproduction is guaranteed or in a condition to support ecological functioning. For criterion 1.1 there is ambition to restore areas which have resulted in a change in species distribution due to human activities to a ‘long term sustainable level’. In general there is a lack of specificity of the terms used in the definition and the lack of threshold values or baselines means that it is not possible to know when GES is considered achieved. 

For species, the only other reference made to an international/regional agreement (apart from the use of HELCOM CORESET for eagle and seals) is to the ASCOBANS standards for the abundance of harbour porpoise, applicable only to the North Sea. No reference is made to OSPAR or to the Habitats and Birds Directives. No direct reference is made to protected/listed species when these are mentioned in the initial assessment. Sweden does not mention in its GES that it will report on protected/listed species as per the timeline of the Habitats and Birds Directive but it does so in the initial assessment. 

Sweden provides detailed information with regard to the development needs of the missing indicators and or the lack of details. It describes the information that is lacking and the projects/programmes in place to address these gaps. Not all indicators are covered by this justification however (e.g. 1.1.3 is not covered). 

Habitats 
According to Sweden’s reporting in the reporting sheets, the GES definitions for habitats at criteria level cover all seabed and water column habitats. A few indicators are focused on specific habitats or habitat-forming communities (e.g. macro vegetation in coastal waters). Habitats considered are mostly coastal (shallow or shelf) and it seems that no specific indicator has been developed for water column habitats (zooplankton and phytoplankton are mentioned as part of the coastal pelagic habitats but no indicator on these have been developed yet). Intertidal habitats are not covered but would not be relevant anyway.  

Sweden mentions that the Commission has recommended the use of the EUNIS level 2 classification of habitats, which it has done while still adapting to Swedish circumstances. It does not use the predominant habitat types defined for the purpose of the MSFD. The habitat types covered by the GES criteria and indicators for habitats include: photic hard and sediment bottom (and the associated communities macro-vegetation and bottom fauna), aphotic hard and sediment bottom (and the associated community bottom fauna) and pelagic coastal and offshore waters (and the associated communities fish, zooplankton and phytoplankton). This classification seems to follow the HELCOM classification of habitats. It has been applied to both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (which is explained by the fact that HELCOM waters overlap with North Sea water on the Kattegat area). 

The GES definitions for Criteria 1.4 and 1.5 on habitat distribution and extent are much more limited than for other criteria. Sweden provides justification for the lack of indicators under criterion 1.4 in the gap analysis of its paper report. It mentions that distribution of benthic habitats is only very limitedly monitored. At the moment, statistical modelling is used to produce maps of habitats distribution which provide information about the probability of occurrence but no information on biomass of habitat-forming species. According to current research projects, 50% of Swedish coastal areas should be mapped by 2014 using modelling. 

Sweden also explains that most of the “biologically valuable marine habitats” in Swedish waters are covered by the Habitats Directive and that habitat distribution is part of the assessment of Favourable Conservation Status (FCV), the next reporting cycle of which will take place in 2013. Sweden does however mention that the Habitats Directive does not cover soft sediment in the aphotic zone, which is most widespread in Sweden and contains habitats listed as threatened under the OSPAR Convention (e.g. sea pens communities).

With regard to criterion 1.5 and 1.6 on habitat extent and condition, Sweden also explains that data is lacking to develop better indicators (e.g. indicator 1.5A only measures the proliferation of macro vegetation in depth, no monitoring of the benthic communities in hard bottoms, lack of phytoplankton-based indicators) and gives an indication of the development needs and plans to address these. 

Criterion 1.6 is still more developed than the other two. Specific indicators have been defined and quantitative threshold values have been specified for a few indicators (e.g. for indicator 1.6B based on OSPAR’s EcoQO and the requirements of the EU Data Collection Regulation (2010/93)). The use of the Bottom Fauna Indices (BQI) is also quite specific and based on the national transposition of the Water Framework Directive (NFS 2008). 

Ecosystem
The ecosystem structure is covered by criterion 1.7, which mentions the components of the food web and the extent and condition of habitats. No specific details/reference levels are provided to determine what is meant with “ecosystem services are provided”. The indicator defined under criterion 1.7 relates only to the trophic levels of the fish community but no thresholds or baselines are further specified. Sweden refers to the HELCOM FISH-PRO project. 

However, in its gap analysis in the paper report, Sweden shows how criterion 1.7 is related to all the other criteria of the Commission Decision (of all descriptors). ";The GES definition for Descriptor 1 by Sweden is considered partially adequate. Sweden has defined GES for all the criteria of the Commission Decision and many indicators. The GES definition covers the most relevant species groups and habitat types (although water column habitats are not well-covered yet). It refers to the Habitats Directive for the reporting on habitats, to the Water Framework Directive and uses a number of standards from HELCOM CORESET. It mentions the OSPAR EcoQOs only in one instance. The majority of indicators are not specific in terms of threshold or, more importantly for the types of indicators defined, baselines. Only a very limited number of indicators are already operational in 2012. The others are expected to be operational by 2014 or even 2018 (which is late to achieve GES by 2020).  To date, it is not possible to fully assess when GES is considered to be achieved. ;"- GES defined for all criteria of the Commission Decision and many indicators

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Sweden has reported on the following species groups for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea: birds, fish and marine mammals (in the electronic reporting, Sweden mentions that mammals are reported under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive). The information included in the reporting sheets is mainly qualitative and covers descriptions on group condition and abundance as well as the main pressures affecting the species group and the status in relation to natural conditions. Trends (only for birds) and judgements on current status are also provided. Sweden reports an overall “not acceptable status” for birds in both regions, but while the trend is stable in the North Sea, it is declining in the Baltic Sea. In relation to fish, in the North Sea in the Skagerrak the status is considered as not fully achieving good environmental status; in the Kattegat where the condition of eels, cartilaginous fishes and cods is reported as critical, the status is “poor”. The condition of fish in the Baltic Sea is better: in the Baltic Proper the status of fish is considered as not fully achieving good environmental status but in the Gulf of Bothnia the status is good.

The main knowledge gaps and plans to address them are also reported –these include e.g. a future national monitoring programme for birds. The information in the paper report is more detailed and refers recurrently to individual species. Literature is often cited and OSPAR, HELCOM and ICES documents and projects are mentioned. The report includes national and international red lists of threatened species; in relation to species covered under the Habitats and Birds Directive, Sweden indicates that these will be reported according to the timescale and format agreed under those Directives.

Habitats
Sweden has carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The assessment is mainly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Literature is often cited and OSPAR and HELCOM documents and projects are mentioned throughout the report. Notwithstanding, Sweden acknowledges a series of information gaps related to insufficient monitoring on e.g. some species of macrofauna or land-based spread of angiosperms, and indicates the need to developed appropriate methods and indicators to improve knowledge.

The information reported by Sweden is more developed in the paper report than in the reporting sheets. In the paper report Sweden describes its predominant habitats, which include seabed habitats and water column habitats, special habitats listed under the Habitats Directive, OSPAR and HELCOM, and other habitats. In the reporting sheets, for the North Sea, Sweden reports on water column habitats all, seabed fauna habitats, macroalgae habitats, angiosperms habitats, and OSPAR Convention Annex I habitats. For the Baltic Sea, Sweden reports on water column habitats all and Helsinki Convention Annex I habitats; in addition it also reports on macroalgae habitats, angiosperms habitats and seabed fauna habitats, separately, for the Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Bothnia.

For most habitats the assessment includes descriptions of habitat distribution, extent and condition, as well as the main pressure affecting the habitats. Trends are provided as are judgements on the current status, although only in a few cases in reference to GES. Thus, e.g. the status of both phytoplankton and zooplankton (reported under water column habitats) in the Baltic is considered “not acceptable”; for the North Sea, there is not such a specific conclusive judgement on phytoplankton and zooplankton but it is indicated that 14% of the coastal water bodies had a status “less than good” in 2012. For some habitat types, some parameters are quantified and the status in relation to natural conditions is provided.

Ecosystems
Sweden states that no initial assessment has been made of ecosystems since adequate criteria and indicators are not yet fully developed. In addition, Sweden indicates that although some effects at ecosystem level are assessed in different sections of the report, these assessments are based on the HARMONY project and OSPAR QSR 2010, for the North Sea, and on HELCOM HOLAS 2010 for the Baltic Sea.";The initial assessment by Sweden of biological features is considered partially adequate. Not all habitat types and species groups are covered, and there is not enough information on the relevant pressures. In addition, there is no information on ecosystems. The information reported is mostly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Judgements on status were provided in some cases. Reference is made to existing international conservation agreements and to the Habitats Directive.;"Features:

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has reported two environmental targets and eleven associated indicators to cover Descriptor 1 and Descriptor 4. The targets are the same for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. In addition to these two specific targets, Sweden reports that the biodiversity descriptors are also covered by the targets on eutrophication (D1) and hazardous substances (D1 and D4). Sweden says that its targets cover indicators 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7 and 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 but this is the case only for fish species and not for other species groups. 

In the reporting sheets, each associated indicator is further specified. Details are provided on what the indicator entails, how it should be measured (qualitatively and sometimes quantitatively) and reference to specific methods/approaches from HELCOM (indicators 1.3E, 1.6E and 1.6A), OSPAR (OSPAR EcoQO on the proportion of large individuals in the fish community, indicator 1.6B) and national approaches from the Environmental Protection Agency (indicators on the size structure of predatory fish). For a number of indicators, quantitative parameters are specified that should be used to measure the indicator, making them potentially measurable. However, thresholds for the achievement of the indicator/target are not proposed. Baselines are not indicated either. 

Many indicators are very similar to the GES indicators. They are related to the fish community, either in coastal or in outer waters. In terms of the species covered by the targets/indicators, the indicators cover key/sensitive species in coastal and offshore waters (specified perch in the Baltic Sea for indicator 1.3E), important functional groups of fish in coastal and offshore waters (specified carp in the Baltic Sea for indicator 1.6E), predatory fish in coastal and offshore waters (unspecified), large individual in offshore waters (unspecified). Apart from the specific mention of two species in the Baltic, the rest of the indicators are relatively unspecific with regard to the species/functional groups covered. 

All indicators are state indicators but in a way, many of them are related to the fishing pressure and other pressures and impacts from human activities (e.g. nutrient enrichment, hydrographical changes such as temperature and salinity). However, none of the indicators are directly geared towards reducing the pressure from a specific human activity. 

As for the GES definition, many indicators are still under development and will not be operational before 2014 (or even 2018 for some of them, which leaves very little time for the implementation of the target before the 2020 deadline for the achievement of GES). ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Sweden to cover D1 and D4 is considered inadequate. The targets/indicators defined are relatively specific and potentially measurable, and they cover most of the Commission Decision criteria and indicators for D1 and D4. However they only focus on the fish community, mammals and birds are not at all addressed.  ;"- Targets and indicators are potentially measurable and specific
- They cover most of the Commission Decision criteria/indicators
- Reference to HELCOM methods
- Only focused on fish, no targets for other species groups
- No pressure targets";1;Inadequate
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D1;Consistency ;;"The assessment of biological features is consistent with the definitions of GES for Descriptors 1 and 4 since it covers the same habitat types and species groups as those targeted by the GES definitions. However the set of targets and indicators is not consistent with the initial assessment since it does not cover birds and mammals despite the fact that the status of these species groups has been assessed as not good in the initial assessment.  

For Descriptor 6, the targets/indicators defined do not make use of the indicator BQI used in the GES definition. Both the targets and GES are defined at a very general level and lack any references to specific features. The targets and GES both show a low level of ambition. ";;;;
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. The definition of GES is applicable for both the North Sean and the Baltic Sea, except for the indicator 10.1A which only applies to the North Sea. Both criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated in the GES definition. 

GES at descriptor level is copied from Annex I of the MSFD. The indicators provided by Swedish (10.1A and 10.1B – only in the paper report) address indicators 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of the Commission Decision. They could be considered as more specific than the Decision as they focus on the amount of litter and impact on organisms, respectively. However, no threshold values or baselines have been set to specify the trend-based GES boundary (e.g. what is meant with “decrease” and “long-term goal”). For instance, it is not clear whether GES for indicators 10.1A and 10.1B is that the environment is free of litter by 2020. 

Indicators 10.1.3 and 10.2.1 are not at all covered by the GES definition. Sweden acknowledges this by stating that these indicators are still under development. It provides some details of the development needs (e.g. use of the Continuous Plankton Recorder for collection of microparticles) and some research projects on-going which will help develop these indicators further (e.g. the Keep Sweden Tidy project for marine litter on beaches). Therefore GES has not yet been defined for micro-particles and for plastic on surface and in water column.

In addition, Sweden mentions plans to further develop the indicators for GES in coastal areas, based on the UNEP protocol. The report refers also the ICES bottom trawling programme BITS. In relation to the North Sea, many of the OSPAR data and methodologies, e.g. on beach litter monitoring are not used but it is not clear if and /or why that method is not considered workable for Sweden. There is no reference to HELCOM approaches.";The GES definition of Sweden for D10 is assessed as partially adequate. Although the definition of GES at descriptor level is a copy of the MSFD, it is not at criteria and indicator levels. However, not all indicators are yet developed and not threshold values or baselines have been set. ;"- Definition at descriptor level is copy of Annex I MSFD

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Sweden acknowledges that there are currently no monitoring programmes of marine litter in the Baltic Sea and that the available data results mainly from the work carried out by non-governmental organizations. Like for the North Sea, Sweden states the need to extend its monitoring programme to cover e.g. the impact on plants and animals, indicating that it is currently discussing suitable indicator species such as mussels, herring and sprat since the northern fulmar is not present in the Baltic Sea.

Sweden has reported on the level of pressure of marine litter on the coastline, the water column and the seabed. For each of these matrices, Sweden describes the current situation and quantifies the amount of litter; no trends or judgements of current status are provided. No information is reported on the impact of marine litter on habitats or functional groups/marine animals. There are no direct references to HELCOM, but the Baltic International Trawling Survey (BITS), which is an ICES initiative and might be used by HELCOM, is mentioned.";The initial assessment of Sweden for marine litter is assessed as partially adequate.

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has defined one target and two associated indicators to address Descriptor 10. The target is the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report; however, the indicators are more developed in the reporting sheets. According to the reporting sheets the first indicator applies only to the North Sea, which is consistent with the definition of GES, but that is not so clear in the paper report. However, projects are under way for the production of reference beaches of the Baltic Sea.

The target is made measurable through the associated indicators. Both indicators monitor the end-of-pipe impact and are expected not to have influence on the pressures/sources of marine litter. There are no indicators for the water column, micro-particles or impact on marine animals yet. The two existing indicators are specific and measurable but as no threshold values have been defined it is not possible to say if they are realistic and achievable. Being free from litter is an ambitious long term objective but since there are no measurable indicators and no threshold values, the actual ambition on the short to medium-term cannot be assessed. Sweden follows the methodologies of OSPAR and ICES, referring expressly to IBTS and BITS programmes in the report.

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden set GES for Descriptor 2 at descriptor and criteria level, in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. The GES definition is the same for both the North Sea and Baltic sub-regions. The descriptor definition is a verbatim copy of the Descriptor as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. The criteria have been defined in more details than those provided in the Commission Decision although criterion 2.1 deviates significantly from the criterion provided in the Commission Decision. 

The GES definition aims for no more introductions of NIS which may adversely affect biological diversity as well as a minimisation of the impact from these species on biodiversity and ecosystems. The definition also applies to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as well as organisms with altered genetic properties. There is no clarification as to what is considered an adverse effect on biological diversity and when species are considered to pose this risk. The Swedish GES criteria do not mention the abundance or state of NIS that are already established in the ecosystem, although this could be implicitly covered by criterion 2.2. Similarly, it does not specifically include the current pressure of NIS and the prevention of spreading or reduction of this already existing pressure, when possible. 

Furthermore, in the accompanying text, Sweden proposes the development of a number of indicators but it does not clarify when these will be operational. In regard to criterion 2.1 several indicators are proposed, monitoring of the granted release permits for NIS, GMOs and species with altered genetic properties by various authorities, introduction of invasive species in sensitive habitats and conservation areas and the number of newly introduced invasive species in international ports and major shipping routes. 

With regard to criterion 2.2, Sweden proposes the establishment of a biopollution level index that measures the impacts of NIS in a given sea. The index should classify the occurrence and spread of NIS and the size of their impact on the original community, habitats and ecosystems. The indicator should provide a quantitative assessment of GES and allow for a comparison between areas. The indicator should be based on a baseline corresponding to the present situation and based on existing monitoring programs. 

The proposed indicators take into account the known vectors of NIS and establish that in regard to criterion 2.2 the baseline will be the current situation. At this moment however these indicators cannot be considered part of the GES definition as they are still in the proposal phase. 

It should be noted that the GES as it is defined by Sweden increases the scope of the descriptor to include GMOs as well as other species with altered genetic properties. This increase in the scope can be considered particularly relevant to aquaculture and activities related to restocking species such as Salmon. This can be considered a good practice as the risks associated with these species are likely to be similar to those from the introduction of NIS. ";The Swedish GES definition for Descriptor 2 is considered partially adequate. The GES is defined at descriptor and criteria level although the criterion 2.1 does not correspond to the one given in the Commission Decision. In particular the GES definition does not refer to the abundance and state of NIS. The further spreading of existing pressures have not been addressed Sweden has made an effort to define potential indicators, but these are not incorporated in the current GES definition nor do they have a date set for when they will be operational. The scope of the GES definition is wider than that from the MSFD since it also refers to GMOs and species with altered genetic characteristics, this can be considered a good practice.;"- GES defined at descriptor and criteria levels

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Swedish initial assessment has been done at a very general level. In the assessment it is mentioned that currently 75 non-indigenous species have been recorded in Swedish waters, 49 in the North Sea and 38 in the Baltic Sea and 10 in both seas. The Swedish reporting sheets lists 6 NIS and 9 genetically distinct forms of native species for the Baltic region. For the North Sea, it lists 9 NIS and 10 genetically distinct forms of native species. However, in the reporting sheet, Sweden specifies that these lists focuses on those species considering as presenting the most important pressures and refers to background document (available through internet link) for more complete lists.

The six non-indigenous species that are expected to constitute the most important problems to fisheries and aquaculture are the American comb jelly, Pacific oyster, signal crayfish, fishhook water flea, American lobster and Round goby. The initial assessment refers to www.frammandearter.se for more information on NIS in Swedish marine waters. 

Shipping is stated to be the main cause of unintentional introductions of aquatic invasive species via ballast water or as fouling on ship hulls. The 11 species most likely to be spread by ballast water in Swedish waters are the fishhook waterflea, Atlantic jackknife clam, Karenia mikimotoi (dinoflagellate), Alexandrium minutum (Flagellate), American comb jelly, Pacific oyster, Chinese Mitten crab, bay barnacle, round goby, Prorocentrum minimum (dinoflagellate) and Coscinodiscus wailesii (diatom). Other important vectors such as aquaculture are not mentioned. 

Sweden qualifies the trend status as declining, with a low level of confidence. But, at the same time, it has considered that the level of the pressure on the environment has been increasing until 2010.

It is also mentioned in the initial assessment that current monitoring programs on biodiversity components are not very appropriate for monitoring NIS since they do not focus on areas considered at high risk of experiencing new NIS introductions. There is no detailed information on data/knowledge gaps and how these will be addressed.";The Swedish initial assessment on non-indigenous species is considered partially adequate. Sweden provides a list of NIS and genetically distinct forms of native species for each of the marine sub-regions. The data are very general and contain very little quantified and qualitative information on the abundance and state of NIS, the impacts of NIS and relevant vectors/pathways. Recent trend and trend status are provided. Information on knowledge gaps and plans to address them is limited.;"- Inventory of NIS provided

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has set two targets which apply to both sub-regions and should be achieved by 2020, hence are time-bound. 

Target C.1 aims for no new introductions of NIS, GMOs and species with altered genetic properties that pose a risk to the genetic, biological diversity or function of the ecosystem. This target requires knowledge on which of these species are already present in Swedish marine waters as well as their potential to pose a risk to be SMART. The associated indicator to monitor permits for new release of NIS, GMOs and other organisms with altered genetic characteristics is not sufficient to monitor all potential vectors such as shipping, unintentional releases from the pet trade or trans-boundary movement of invasive species. The target is not specific as it is worded in a very general way and expresses rather GES than an environmental target. 

However, the associated indicator relates to ‘permissions to release non-indigenous species’ and seems to suggest that the target actually covers only NIS introduced for aquaculture purposes. Even in that case, it is not clear how the indicator would allow measuring the targets. In conclusion, the target and its associated indicator are very difficult to interpret and do not seem adequate.

Target C.2 specifically deals with the spread of NIS due to shipping but contains the qualifier “as far as possible.” This poses the question on how to interpret what is possible and not possible. As a consequence, the target is not measurable. The target has not incorporated the condition that it applies only to species which pose a risk and can therefore be interpreted to apply to all NIS. The two associated indicators are the number of newly introduced invasive species in sensitive habitats, protected areas, international ports and major shipping routes. Unlike the target, the two indicators are focused on invasive species rather than NIS in general, this requires a knowledge of which species are invasive and is less stringent than the target. 

Neither of the two targets deal with the abundance of NIS either newly introduced or already established within the ecosystem. They addressed specific pathways (at least if the first one is interpreted as targeting NIS used in aquaculture). ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Sweden to cover D2 is considered partially adequate. The targets only address introductions of new NIS as well as GMOs and species with altered genetic properties. The targets however do not address the abundance of NIS or their impact on the ecosystem. One of the targets is not clearly worded. They are not measurable given their lack of specification, and are too vague to ensure that GES is reached.;"- Targets only address introductions of new NIS as well as GMOs and species with altered genetic properties

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D2;Consistency ;;Both the GES and targets refer to NIS as well as GMOs and species with altered genetic properties, the latter two types of species are not referred to in the initial assessment, and they both refer not only to the introduction of new NIS but also the effects on the ecosystem. Both the GES and targets do not explicitly deal with the abundance of NIS in the ecosystem and can therefore not be considered to fully cover the descriptor as given in Annex I of the Directive. The targets appear as an expression of the GES definition with a focus on specific pressure. This is consistent but the targets are too vague to ensure reaching GES.;;;;
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Swedish GES definition for Descriptor 3 is set at the descriptor, criteria and indicator levels and is the same for both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea marine regions. The descriptor is a verbatim copy of the descriptor from Annex I. All three criteria from the 2010 Commission Decision have been applied and criteria 3.1 and 3.2 have associated indicators provided. 

Criterion 3.1 and the associated indicator 3.1A states that all commercial fish species should be exploited below Fmsy which is in line with the Commission Decision but it should also apply to shellfish stocks. Indicator 3.1B, which corresponds to secondary indicator 3.2.2 from the Commission Decision, applies to stocks for which there are no ICES analytical assessments. Regarding indicator 3.1B it is unclear which baseline or desired direction will be applied but it is stated that this indicator needs to be developed further and should be operational by 2018. 

Criterion 3.2 has been defined in a qualitative way stating that the reproductive capacity of fish stocks should be at levels that guarantee viable sustainable stocks but it does not specify that the criterion applies to all commercial fish species as is specified for criterion 3.1. The indicator 3.2A states that the SSB of stocks should be above the BMSY-trigger level which is in line with the commission decision but it is not specified whether this applies for all stocks for which ICES advice is available. Indicator 3.2B does not clarify which baseline or desired direction will be applied but it is stated that this indicator needs to be developed further and should be operational by 2018. 

Criterion 3.3 has been applied but rather than stating that it should be ensured that stocks are healthy it is stated that the population age and size structure should guarantee long term productivity which could potentially be interpreted differently. This might explain why indicators 3.1C and 3.1D are applied to criterion 3.1 rather than criterion 3.3. ";The Swedish GES definition for D3 is considered partially adequate. The GES definition for criterion 3.1 states that all fish stocks should be exploited below Fmsy but it should also include shellfish stocks. Criterion 3.2, indicator 3.1B specifies that stocks should be exploited at BMSY-trigger but is not sufficiently specific that this applies to all stocks for which an analytical assessment is available, the descriptor however requires that all stocks are within safe biological limits so that this is not an issue. Criterion 3.3 has been applied although rather than referring to healthy stocks it refers to maintaining long term productivity. In relation to indicator 3.1D, if this is considered to support criterion 3.3, it could be considered as a good practice as it contains a well-defined threshold.;"- All stocks should be within safe biological limits
- Clear that all fish stocks should be exploited below Fmsy
- Approximation of criterion 3.3 applied (without thresholds)
- Fmsy limit not applied for shellfish stocks";2;Partially adequate
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Swedish initial assessment has been performed at a generally high level, which Sweden has explained by a lack of developed indicators for fisheries and because it was not determined what type of information was requested. Sweden also mentions, in the information gaps and future plans section of the reporting sheets, that while it collects data for the DCF it has not reported at this level of detail for the MSFD but will do so for the next assessment in 2018. 

The assessment does provide an overview of the status of stocks in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat using the ICES analytical assessments in regard to MSY reference points. Thus, while the stocks of Haddock and Blue whiting are considered sustainable, the stocks of Spring-spawning Herring, Cod and Coalfish are not. A similar overview is missing for the Baltic although various stocks are reported on in regard to trends and general condition for both regions. An overview of landings of pelagic and demersal stocks has been provided through use of maps showing ICES landing data for ICES squares in Swedish waters. ";The Swedish initial assessment is considered adequate for the North Sea region and partially adequate for the Baltic Sea region. Sweden makes use of ICES data to report on the status of Atlantic stocks in regard to MSY reference points and the reporting on landings of demersal and pelagic stocks data from Swedish waters is good. Also Sweden has reported various data on fish stocks in regards to trends and developments although without a clear structure. Baltic stocks are not reported on in regards to MSY reference points, while ICES data exists for some stocks. ;"- Basic assessment of fisheries

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The main target for Descriptor 3 (Target C.3) is very similar to the actual GES definition for the descriptor and lacks specific details. The indicators also follow the structure of the GES definition and apply both the primary and secondary indicators. The threshold for the primary indicator 3.1A is set at Fmsy and applies to stocks for which there is an analytical assessment, 100% of the stocks with analytical assessments need to be exploited below Fmsy in order to achieve GES. The primary indicator (3.2A) for SSB states that the indicator applies to all stocks from the DCF and states that 100% of the stocks should be above BMSY-trigger in accordance with the relevant ICES advice. However it can be assumed that BMSY-trigger reference points will not be known for all species so this target might only apply to stocks for which there is an analytical assessment, this however is not stated as it is for indicator 3.1A, therefore a strict interpretation would result in the assumption that Sweden intends this target to apply to all DCF stocks. 

In regard to the secondary indicator 3.1B it is stated that both methods and data for calculating the indicator is available for many species while in regard to indicator 3.2B it only stated that there are methods to do trend analysis or compare an evaluation period with older reference data, the text is unclear on whether older reference data exists. The indicators 3.1B and 3.2B do not have threshold values so while there are appropriate indicators they do not contribute to making the target SMART.

The C4 target and associated indicators apply to D3 as well as D1 and D4. Target C4 is more directly related to D4 and therefore not discussed here. The C4 indicators are most relevant for Criterion 3.3 of the Commission Decision. The indicators are each provided in duplicate once for coastal waters and once for offshore waters. Each of the C4 indicators deals with the size structure of the fish community with a particular focus on large individuals. The indicators 1.6A and 1.6B rely on fisheries data while two parallel indicators measuring the same fish community attributes rely on data collected from fishery independent data collection. The indicator measuring changes in the Length Distribution of the fish community in offshore waters (95% percentile) is the same as the indicator proposed for GES criterion 3.3 in the Commission Decision but then applied as a target indicator. Each of these indicators will be relevant for measuring aspects related to criterion 3.3 but currently no thresholds have been set. ";The targets are partially adequate. The targets are set in direct relation to the GES definition and aim for all stocks with analytical assessments to be exploited below Fmsy and have a SSB higher than BMSY-trigger. No thresholds have been set for the secondary indicators used for the C3 targets.  The C4 target and indicators lack thresholds and are therefore currently not measurable.;"- Target requires all stocks with analytical assessments to be exploited below Fmsy

Both the targets and GES are not always clear in regarding to the aggregation that will be applied to measure the achievement of GES or target (e.g. does it apply to all stocks?). 

The initial assessment for the North Atlantic lists the stocks with analytical assessments in their relation to MSY reference points but this is not done for the Baltic, with no explanation given. This assessment however is consistent with the way GES and the targets have been defined.";;;;
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 4 at the descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. All three criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision are addresses by the GES definition and all of the (primary) indicators. It should be noted that indicators 4.2B and 4.3A have not been reported in the reporting sheets.

In terms of the features covered by the Descriptor, in the reporting sheets Sweden reports that D4 at descriptor level covers all functional groups and all seabed and water column habitats. The definitions at criteria and indicator levels however are more specific. 

Specific species are mentioned/addressed in a few indicators: the white-tailed eagle in the Baltic Sea (indicator 4.1A) and the harbour porpoise and seal for the North Sea and the grey seal, the ringed seal and the harbour seal in the Baltic Sea through indicator 4.1B on mammals. According to this therefore, criterion 4.1 on the productivity of key species/trophic group addresses only these species. Criterion 4.2 on selected predator species focuses only on fish and criterion 4.3 balanced food web functioning focuses on the fish community in coastal waters and on waterfowl species. No reference is made to plankton or benthos, only the higher level taxon is addressed by the GES definition of D4.

In terms of baselines, the definition at descriptor level refers to ‘normal abundance’ and at criteria level to ‘natural fluctuations’ and ‘natural trophic regulation’. As for D1 therefore, the baselines seem to be used in the sense of ‘reference conditions’, i.e. in line with prevailing conditions, free from human influence (“intrinsic growth rate of a population that is unaffected by man”). No reference is made to a possible acceptable deviation for the criteria. 

The baselines for most indicators are not specified and the indicators are not quantified except for indicator 4.1A on the productivity of the white-tailed eagle and indicator 4.1B on the growth rate of certain marine mammals, for which threshold values have been defined. The rest of the indicators, as for most indicators for D1, are still under development and are not expected to be operational before 2014 (or even 2018 for the North Sea). 

No direct reference is made in the definitions to OSPAR, HELCOM, EU standards or any international agreement. Indirect reference is made to various HELCOM programmes through the methods to be used to measure/monitor the indicators (e.g. HELCOM FISH-PRO). 

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Ecosystems
The ecosystem structure is covered by criterion 1.7, which mentions the components of the food web and the extent and condition of habitats. No specific details/reference levels are provided to determine what is meant with “ecosystem services are provided”. The indicator defined under criterion 1.7 relates only to the trophic levels of the fish community but no thresholds or baselines are further specified. Sweden refers to the HELCOM FISH-PRO project. 

However, in its gap analysis in the paper report, Sweden shows how criterion 1.7 is related to all the other criteria of the Commission Decision (of all descriptors). ";Taking into account that D4 requires unfamiliar assessment approaches the GES definition for Descriptor 4 by Sweden is considered adequate. All criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision are covered, the selected species are appropriate although additional species might be necessary to fully determine whether GES has been determined for food webs.;"- GES definition covers all criteria and indicators by Commission Decision

Ecosystems
Sweden states that no initial assessment has been made of ecosystems since adequate criteria and indicators are not yet fully developed. In addition, Sweden indicates that although some effects at ecosystem level are assessed in different sections of the report, these assessments are based on the HARMONY project and OSPAR QSR 2010, for the North Sea, and on HELCOM HOLAS 2010 for the Baltic Sea.";Not reported.;- Not reported;0;Not reported
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Inadequate; 1):

Sweden has reported two environmental targets and eleven associated indicators to cover Descriptor 1 and Descriptor 4. The targets are the same for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. In addition to these two specific targets, Sweden reports that the biodiversity descriptors are also covered by the targets on eutrophication (D1) and hazardous substances (D1 and D4). Sweden says that its targets cover indicators 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7 and 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 but this is the case only for fish species and not for other species groups. 

In the reporting sheets, each associated indicator is further specified. Details are provided on what the indicator entails, how it should be measured (qualitatively and sometimes quantitatively) and reference to specific methods/approaches from HELCOM (indicators 1.3E, 1.6E and 1.6A), OSPAR (OSPAR EcoQO on the proportion of large individuals in the fish community, indicator 1.6B) and national approaches from the Environmental Protection Agency (indicators on the size structure of predatory fish). For a number of indicators, quantitative parameters are specified that should be used to measure the indicator, making them potentially measurable. However, thresholds for the achievement of the indicator/target are not proposed. Baselines are not indicated either. 

Many indicators are very similar to the GES indicators. They are related to the fish community, either in coastal or in outer waters. In terms of the species covered by the targets/indicators, the indicators cover key/sensitive species in coastal and offshore waters (specified perch in the Baltic Sea for indicator 1.3E), important functional groups of fish in coastal and offshore waters (specified carp in the Baltic Sea for indicator 1.6E), predatory fish in coastal and offshore waters (unspecified), large individual in offshore waters (unspecified). Apart from the specific mention of two species in the Baltic, the rest of the indicators are relatively unspecific with regard to the species/functional groups covered. 

All indicators are state indicators but in a way, many of them are related to the fishing pressure and other pressures and impacts from human activities (e.g. nutrient enrichment, hydrographical changes such as temperature and salinity). However, none of the indicators are directly geared towards reducing the pressure from a specific human activity. 

As for the GES definition, many indicators are still under development and will not be operational before 2014 (or even 2018 for some of them, which leaves very little time for the implementation of the target before the 2020 deadline for the achievement of GES). ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The set of targets and indicators defined by Sweden to cover D1 and D4 is considered inadequate. The targets/indicators defined are relatively specific and potentially measurable, and they cover most of the Commission Decision criteria and indicators for D1 and D4. However they only focus on the fish community, mammals and birds are not at all addressed.  ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

- Targets and indicators are potentially measurable and specific
- They cover most of the Commission Decision criteria/indicators

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D4;Consistency ;;"The assessment of biological features is consistent with the definitions of GES for Descriptors 1 and 4 since it covers the same habitat types and species groups as those targeted by the GES definitions. However the set of targets and indicators is not consistent with the initial assessment since it does not cover birds and mammals despite the fact that the status of these species groups has been assessed as not good in the initial assessment.  

For Descriptor 6, the targets/indicators defined do not make use of the indicator BQI used in the GES definition. Both the targets and GES are defined at a very general level and lack any references to specific features. The targets and GES both show a low level of ambition. ";;;;
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. The definition is applicable to both Swedish marine regions – the North Sea and the Baltic Sea – and uses MSFD definition of good trophic status, with all three criteria (nutrient levels, direct and indirect impacts) defined separately, using indicators which equate to 5.1.1, 5.2.1. 5.2.2, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 of the 2010 Commission Decision. Indicators 5.1B, 5.2B and 5.2D are only reported in the paper report.
 
In the accompanying text to the GES definitions at indicator level, extensive reference is made to the HELCOM EUTRO-PRO indicators for the development of the Swedish indicators but it is not clearly explained how they relate to the 2010 Commission Decision indicators.  It seems that no indicator relating to nutrient ratios (5.1.2) (although it may not be relevant for Swedish waters), abundance of opportunistic macroalgae (or more specifically reed growth on sandy beaches) (5.2.3) or changes in floristic composition (5.2.4) is used for measurement of GES, despite the fact that reference to toxic phytoplankton blooms, notably cyanobacteria, is made in the initial assessment. In addition to dissolved oxygen status of bottom waters, Sweden also uses the results of a benthic faunal index in determining whether or not GES has been achieved.

It is not entirely clear if the Water Framework Directive assessment methodologies and GES thresholds were used for MSFD assessment purposes but the document systematically referred to (NFS 2008:1) is the regulations and general advice related to the classification of and environmental quality standards for surface waters by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (including coastal water bodies assessment/ classification), which refers to the WFD. In terms of threshold values, Sweden provides, in the Annex 2 of its paper report, all relevant threshold values for the GES indicators it has defined for all relevant assessment areas. It also describes the indicators that it considers to be still under development but which could be relevant for the assessment of GES (e.g. development of indicators 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 unlikely to take place before 2018 on the basis of the WATERS research programme). ";The GES definition of Sweden for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition of GES is criteria/indicator-based, including all criteria, and most (if not all) indicators, in addition to which the assessment methodology incorporates results from a benthic faunal index (the BQI, Benthic Quality Index), from which hypoxic events could be intimated over a much longer timescale than from occasional but regular dissolved oxygen monitoring. Indicators on abundance of opportunistic macroalgae and species shift in floristic composition are missing however. The definition refers to a methods manual, which was presumably developed for the WFD assessment purpose, so MSFD GES is presumably linked to the WFD GES. Since normative values have been provided for all GES indicators, the GES definition is sufficiently specific to determine when GES has been achieved.;"- GES definition covers all the criteria from the 2010 Commission Decision

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Sweden has carried out and reported two separate assessments for the Baltic Sea – one for the Baltic proper and other for the Gulf of Bothnia. It is unclear what proportion of Sweden’s Baltic/Bothnian waters has been covered by the assessments but the assessment includes an important amount of details and knowledge. The two assessments cover all relevant nutrients in terms of loads and impacts. Organic loads are also presented, with an increasing trend, and while it is stated that nutrient loads are estimated to have increased about 4-fold over the last century, no load reductions over the past 20-year period (approx.) are reported. Agriculture, forestry and urban discharges are listed as the main causes of eutrophication for both areas. All relevant sources of nutrients and vectors of entry to the sea are considered, including inputs from adjacent marine waters, internal loading from historically nutrient-enriched sediments, atmospheric deposition, groundwater inputs, river loads and coastal discharges.

Eutrophication in Swedish waters affects habitats in both the water column and on the sea bed. Fisheries can also be affected indirectly by eutrophication. Sweden describes nutrient levels not only in surface waters, but also in deeper waters, offering an insight into the importance of stratification and mixing in its Baltic/Bothnian waters. While the Baltic Proper is regarded as an area with serious problems of eutrophication, in the Bothnian bay only minor issues were reported. In the Bothnian Sea, which lies between the other two marine areas, more pronounced impacts are apparent. HELCOM is referred to recurrently throughout both initial assessments.";The initial assessment of Sweden for eutrophication in the Baltic Sea (and in the Bay of Bothnia) is considered as adequate.

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has defined one target and the associated indicators to address Descriptor 5 (in the reporting sheets one additional target one hazardous substances is reported but this appears to be a typo). The set of target and associated indicators applies both to the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. While the target and first two indicators apply to both regions as a whole, the last three indicators (based on the GES indicators 5.1B, 5.1C and 5.1D) have been defined for specific assessment areas in the two (sub)regions and apply only to offshore waters. The reason why specific GES definitions are proposed for specific assessment areas is because the threshold values (from NFS 2008:1 and HELCOM COMBINE) vary according to the area to which they apply.

The target is a re-wording of the overall D5 GES definition provided in Annex I of the MSFD. Assessment of progress can be defined in terms of measured/estimated loads reduction. The first two indicators are not measurable since no quantitative threshold values have been defined. In the paper report, Sweden provides additional information regarding the second associated indicator on nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff and point sources. It is the only target-associated indicator (of all descriptors) which is further specified in the paper report and it is not clear why this indicator particularly is further developed. Sweden described the method to be used to measure this indicator (HELCOM 2011 PLC-Water guidelines and OSPAR 1998 RID Principles) and specifies a GES boundary (assessment of GES will be based on normalized annual mean flow over the previous six years. The long term goal is that the supply should be less than the maximum load to be defined within the framework of international agreements). The first indicator is said to be still under development.

The last three indicators are the same as the GES indicators and specific threshold values have been defined according to the assessment area they cover (which are also the same as the GES boundaries). They are based on the HELCOM COMBINE programme for both regions. 

The indicators on chlorophyll-a concentrations and visibility in offshore waters are impact-related. Individual pressures/human activities resulting in organic/nutrient loads are not targeted, but total pressures are.

";The set of environmental target and associated indicators defined by Sweden for D5 is considered as partially adequate. It has defined a number of specific indicators with defined threshold values per assessment areas.

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are consistent with Sweden’s definition of GES. In the North Sea, the pressures assessment is fully consistent with the definition of GES and the impact assessment considers nutrient concentrations and the phytoplankton community in terms of chlorophyll concentrations, as well as changes in the floristic community composition and to impacts on seabed communities. In the Baltic Sea, individual pressures and the total eutrophication pressures are described in detail and GES is well defined in terms of nutrient concentrations, direct and indirect impacts. Growth of opportunistic macroalgae is apparently not considered in the definition of GES, but is not considered as an impact. Occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms is considered as an impact, but it is not specified whether this is included in the definition of GES. In addition, impacts on macrophytobenthos communities appear to be described more in theoretical than actual (assessed) terms.

The set of targets and indicators are only partially consistent with the GES definition as it covers relevant indicators but a number of other indicators included in the GES definition are missing and the indicators defined apply only to offshore waters. Coastal waters do not seem to be covered by the last three (more specific) indicators, which means that it is not certain whether the target/indicators are sufficient to help achieve GES. ";;;;
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined the GES for Descriptor 6 at the level of the descriptor, criteria and indicators. It covers both criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision but only provides indicators to cover criterion 6.2. Indicator 6.2A is defined for coastal waters and indicator 6.2B is for offshore waters using the benthic index BQI which corresponds to indicator 6.2.2 of the 2010 Commission Decision. Except for indicator 6.2.2 none of the indicators from the 2010 Commission decision have been applied when defining GES. The Descriptor itself is a verbatim copy of the descriptor as provided in Annex I. 

Criterion 6.1 is a pressure-related criterion while 6.2 is a state-related criterion. Both criteria require that the benthic community are maintained at a general level, e.g. ecological functions, species diversity, presence of species, ecological structure are maintained. These conditions do not set any specific baselines or thresholds and could therefore allow both improvements as well as further degradation of the benthic community from the current situation. Indicators 6.2A and 6.2B do set specific thresholds for Descriptor 6 using the Benthic Quality Index for coastal and offshore waters but these indicators rely on invertebrate fauna and therefore may not include important benthic habitats and components. 

No specific substrate type and no specific benthic species are mentioned in the definition, which remains very general. 

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at the level of the descriptor, the criteria and the indicators. It covers all criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision and most of the indicators. The indicators that are not addressed in the definition include 1.1.2 (distributional pattern), 1.1.3 (area covered by species), 1.3.2 (genetic structure), 1.4.1 (distributional range), 1.4.2 (distributional pattern), 1.5.2 (habitat volume), 1.6.3 (physical, hydrological and chemical conditions). It should be noted that a number of indicators have not been reported in the reporting sheets (for either region) and are only present in the paper reports (1.2D, 1.3E, 1.6A and 1.6B).

Habitats 
According to Sweden’s reporting in the reporting sheets, the GES definitions for habitats at criteria level cover all seabed and water column habitats. A few indicators are focused on specific habitats or habitat-forming communities (e.g. macro vegetation in coastal waters). Habitats considered are mostly coastal (shallow or shelf) and it seems that no specific indicator has been developed for water column habitats (zooplankton and phytoplankton are mentioned as part of the coastal pelagic habitats but no indicator on these have been developed yet). Intertidal habitats are not covered but would not be relevant anyway.  

Sweden mentions that the Commission has recommended the use of the EUNIS level 2 classification of habitats, which it has done while still adapting to Swedish circumstances. It does not use the predominant habitat types defined for the purpose of the MSFD. The habitat types covered by the GES criteria and indicators for habitats include: photic hard and sediment bottom (and the associated communities macro-vegetation and bottom fauna), aphotic hard and sediment bottom (and the associated community bottom fauna) and pelagic coastal and offshore waters (and the associated communities fish, zooplankton and phytoplankton). This classification seems to follow the HELCOM classification of habitats. It has been applied to both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (which is explained by the fact that HELCOM waters overlap with North Sea water on the Kattegat area). 

The GES definitions for Criteria 1.4 and 1.5 on habitat distribution and extent are much more limited than for other criteria. Sweden provides justification for the lack of indicators under criterion 1.4 in the gap analysis of its paper report. It mentions that distribution of benthic habitats is only very limitedly monitored. At the moment, statistical modelling is used to produce maps of habitats distribution which provide information about the probability of occurrence but no information on biomass of habitat-forming species. According to current research projects, 50% of Swedish coastal areas should be mapped by 2014 using modelling. 

Sweden also explains that most of the “biologically valuable marine habitats” in Swedish waters are covered by the Habitats Directive and that habitat distribution is part of the assessment of Favourable Conservation Status (FCV), the next reporting cycle of which will take place in 2013. Sweden does however mention that the Habitats Directive does not cover soft sediment in the aphotic zone, which is most widespread in Sweden and contains habitats listed as threatened under the OSPAR Convention (e.g. sea pens communities).

With regard to criterion 1.5 and 1.6 on habitat extent and condition, Sweden also explains that data is lacking to develop better indicators (e.g. indicator 1.5A only measures the proliferation of macro vegetation in depth, no monitoring of the benthic communities in hard bottoms, lack of phytoplankton-based indicators) and gives an indication of the development needs and plans to address these. 

Criterion 1.6 is still more developed than the other two. Specific indicators have been defined and quantitative threshold values have been specified for a few indicators (e.g. for indicator 1.6B based on OSPAR’s EcoQO and the requirements of the EU Data Collection Regulation (2010/93)). The use of the Bottom Fauna Indices (BQI) is also quite specific and based on the national transposition of the Water Framework Directive (NFS 2008). ";"The Swedish GES definition for descriptor 6 is considered partially adequate. The definition of GES covers both criteria of the Commission Decision and only one indicator. Except for the thresholds set for indicators 6.2A and 6.2B, which do not take into account the North Sea, the GES definition does not set specific baselines or thresholds and the definitions at criteria level use unspecific terms. The specific thresholds set using the BQI index might not include all relevant biogenic habitats and ecosystem components to measure adequately the achievement of GES in the relevant sea areas. The GES definition in general shows a relatively low level of ambition for Descriptor 6.

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate, 2):

The GES definition for Descriptor 1 by Sweden is considered partially adequate. Sweden has defined GES for all the criteria of the Commission Decision and many indicators. The GES definition covers the most relevant species groups and habitat types (although water column habitats are not well-covered yet). It refers to the Habitats Directive for the reporting on habitats, to the Water Framework Directive and uses a number of standards from HELCOM CORESET. It mentions the OSPAR EcoQOs only in one instance. The majority of indicators are not specific in terms of threshold or, more importantly for the types of indicators defined, baselines. Only a very limited number of indicators are already operational in 2012. The others are expected to be operational by 2014 or even 2018 (which is late to achieve GES by 2020). To date, it is not possible to fully assess when GES is considered to be achieved.";"- GES definition covers both criteria of the Commission Decision and only indicator 6.2.2

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

Sweden has carried out an initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage for both the North Sea and in the Baltic Sea. Sweden acknowledges the need to collect more information on the activities causing smothering of the seabed and also mentions the need to improve data concerning coastal waters. Sweden states that work is underway within ICES to improve the collection and analysis of data on bottom trawling and similar activities and their impact on the relevant habitats.

The main causes of physical loss are listed and briefly described: renewable energy structures, solid waste disposal and dredging. Although no quantification is made, maps are provided on e.g. existing and planned wind turbines or ports with an area over 2,500 square meters. The main features affected by physical loss are also listed. It is reported that the current level of pressure is stable but no conclusive judgements on the level of pressure or its impacts have been reported (albeit it is indicated that the level of the pressure may be significant, particularly in coastal waters). 

In relation to physical damage, Sweden had listed the main causes of pressure as being fisheries, shipping and tourism, indicating in addition that bottom trawling is the main cause of abrasion. Bottom trawling is said to be more intense in the North Sea than in the Baltic Sea, both in terms of intensity and extent, and map showing the area where this activity occurs is provided. Sediment habitats and demersal fish are indicated as the main features impacted by physical damage but some individual species (herring, sprat and cod) are expressly referred to. No trends or conclusive judgements on the level of pressure or its impacts have been provided, however, it is indicated that abrasion by trawling probably causes damage to various seabed habitats. Reference is made to assessments by both OSPAR and HELCOM. 

Biological features (Partially adequate; 2):

Habitats
Sweden has carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The assessment is mainly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Literature is often cited and OSPAR and HELCOM documents and projects are mentioned throughout the report. Notwithstanding, Sweden acknowledges a series of information gaps related to insufficient monitoring on e.g. some species of macrofauna or land-based spread of angiosperms, and indicates the need to developed appropriate methods and indicators to improve knowledge.

The information reported by Sweden is more developed in the paper report than in the reporting sheets. In the paper report Sweden describes its predominant habitats, which include seabed habitats and water column habitats, special habitats listed under the Habitats Directive, OSPAR and HELCOM, and other habitats. In the reporting sheets, for the North Sea, Sweden reports on water column habitats all, seabed fauna habitats, macroalgae habitats, angiosperms habitats, and OSPAR Convention Annex I habitats. For the Baltic Sea, Sweden reports on water column habitats all and Helsinki Convention Annex I habitats; in addition it also reports on macroalgae habitats, angiosperms habitats and seabed fauna habitats, separately, for the Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Bothnia.

For most habitats the assessment includes descriptions of habitat distribution, extent and condition, as well as the main pressure affecting the habitats. Trends are provided as are judgements on the current status, although only in a few cases in reference to GES. Thus, e.g. the status of both phytoplankton and zooplankton (reported under water column habitats) in the Baltic is considered “not acceptable”; for the North Sea, there is not such a specific conclusive judgement on phytoplankton and zooplankton but it is indicated that 14% of the coastal water bodies had a status “less than good” in 2012. For some habitat types, some parameters are quantified and the status in relation to natural conditions is provided.";"From Descriptor 1 , 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures:
The initial assessment by Sweden of physical loss and damage is considered partially adequate. The different types and causes of physical loss and damage are documented and reported. However, the information on impacts is less comprehensive – the habitats impacted are listed but there is no mention to what they are subject to. In addition, there are no conclusive judgements on the current status even if there is information on the plans to gather data that will allow making these judgements in the future.

Features:
The initial assessment by Sweden of biological features is considered partially adequate. Not all habitat types and species groups are covered, and there is not enough information on the relevant pressures. In addition, there is no information on ecosystems.

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has defined two general targets for Descriptor 6. Target D.1 seems to relate to the quality of habitats not affected by human activities while target D.2 is target dealing with the extent of biogenic substrate. 

The indicators defined for target D.1 are specific with regard to the human activities addressed by the target. They are potentially measurable but no threshold values have been set which means that they are not SMART. In addition, they only deal with the area of the seafloor that is affected by various human activities and will therefore not measure how well areas unaffected by human activities provide conditions for maintaining the structure and function of sea beds as the target requires. Also, the fact that the target refers to “sea beds” instead of “seabed habitats” creates some uncertainty as to what conditions and functions need to be maintained. 

Target D.2 only has one indicator and both the target and indicator deal with biogenic substrate as a whole and make no differentiation between different types of biogenic substrates. The implied baseline for target D.2 is the current area of biogenic substrate, however this is not equivalent to the current seabed conditions as there can still be shifts in the types of biogenic substrates while the area remains the same or increases. Also the indicators provided for target D.1 seem more relevant for target D.2. ";The Swedish targets for descriptor 6 are considered partially adequate. The targets are unspecific in certain aspects as they do not refer to specific habitats or seabed components. The indicators for target D.1 are not suitable to measure the achievement of the target because of the lack of threshold values. However they are specific in the human activities addressed by the target. The two targets for D6 on their own as well as together are weak and are likely to be insufficient for achieving GES.;"- Relatively unspecific (no reference to specific substrate types/species)

However the set of targets and indicators is not consistent with the initial assessment since it does not cover birds and mammals despite the fact that the status of these species groups has been assessed as not good in the initial assessment.  

For Descriptor 6, the targets/indicators defined do not make use of the indicator BQI used in the GES definition. Both the targets and GES are defined at a very general level and lack any references to specific features. The targets and GES both show a low level of ambition. ";;;;
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. All criteria laid out for Descriptor 7 in the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated, but no indicators have been defined for criterion 7.2 and no scientific justification has been provided for covering only temperature and salinity changes under criterion 7.1. The definition of GES is the same in reporting sheets and in the paper report and is applicable to both marine regions – the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. 

No justification is provided concerning Sweden’s interpretation that the “MSFD refers to large scale and not local scale impacts” (see also the report on the initial assessment), and the scale ranges concerned are not clearly defined (wind farms or bridges seem to be considered “large scale projects”, while their potential effects should be considered “local”). In addition, the concepts of “permanent”, “large scale”, “changes” or “alteration” are not developed at all.

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has defined one target to address Descriptor 7 and reported that two associated indicators are under development. The target and associated indicators are the same in the paper report and in the reporting sheets and apply to both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. 

The only target is defined in a very general way, and the formulation is very close to the GES definition. The target is not SMART. It is relatively specific and potentially measurable but since the indicators are not developed, no threshold values are provided and no mention to any time reference is made it is not possible to assess if it is realistic or achievable.

The target is not sufficiently targeted towards reducing levels of a specified pressure or impact which are preventing GES from being achieved since it does not address specific pressures or impacts.

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in the paper report and the reporting sheets (covering concentration and effects of contaminants). The GES definition is nearly the same for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The definition at descriptor level is a copy of the definition for Descriptor 8 in Annex I of the Directive but it is then further specified at criteria and indicator levels.

The links between Descriptor 8 and Descriptors 1 and 4 are mentioned in the paper report. A number of indicators for the GES definition of D8 are also used for D1 and D4 (indicators 8.2B and 8.2C).

Concentration of contaminants
Sweden covers the criterion on concentration of contaminants through a general statement, which refers to the three relevant matrices (water, sediment and biota), and three more specific indicators. 

The two first indicators, which are more restricted as they only cover one substance each measured in fish, are defined according to an absolute threshold that should not be exceeded. The third indicator, which covers more substances in different matrices (fish, mussels and guillemot eggs) is trend-based (no significant increasing trend over 6 years). 

The two first indicators (8.1A and 8.1B) relate to the concentrations of mercury (Hg) and HCB in fish. The threshold values, corresponding to the EU EQS (from Directive 2008/105/EC) for these substances, are reproduced in the reporting sheets (0.02 mg / kg wet weight for mercury and 0.01 mg / kg wet weight for HCB). Sweden justifies the selection of these two substances by stating that mercury is mandatory for monitoring by OSPAR and HELCOM CORESET and mercury and HCB are both priority substances under Directive 2008/105/EC. Both substances are already monitored for fish, mussels, guillemot eggs and sediment within the national marine monitoring program. Because fish is high up in the food web, hazardous substances in fish pose risks both to other individuals in the marine ecosystem (mammals, birds) and to humans through the consumption of fish. Therefore, according to Sweden fish is an appropriate matrix for the measurement of concentrations of these two dangerous substances and the assessment of risks of adverse effects. 

Despite the reference to the use of sediment and waters as matrices for the measurement of concentrations in the definition of criterion 8.1, no mention is made of these in the specific indicators. Sweden mentions that it is using the most appropriate matrices for the monitoring of hazardous substances which pose a risk to the marine environment, biota and sediment. However, it mentions that no agreed levels have been defined for sediment at EU and national level. This therefore seems to exclude the use of the EQS in marine waters for this matrix. It also means that Sweden does not use the OSPAR’s and HELCOM’s environmental assessment criteria for measurements in biota other than fish and in sediment. Because Sweden is not using the OSPAR/HELCOM EAC in their GES definition and does not refer to the EQS in water, it is understandable that it has set absolute thresholds for only two substances, Hg and HCB, as these are two of the only three substances for which an EQS has been set in biota. It is not certain why Sweden has not set a similar indicator for the third substance, HCBD.

The third indicator (8.1C) is further specified in the reporting sheet and the paper report as a list of the relevant substances to be measured per matrix is provided (Fish: Hg, Cd, Pb, HCB, HBCD, brominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds, HCH, non-dioxin-like PCBs and dioxins, dibenzofurans and dioxin-like PCBs; Mussels: Hg, Cd, Pb and PAH; Guillemot eggs: Hg, Cd, Pb, HCB, dioxins , dibenzofurans, dioxin-like PCBs, non-dioxin-like PCBs, HBCD, brominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds and HCH). Since indicator 8.1C is trend-based and a timescale is specified (over the past 6 years), there is no need for threshold values and it is understood that the baseline is the concentration levels for these substances in 2012 to achieve GES in 2020. It is not clear what the term “significant increasing trend” means and whether a limited increase is acceptable. 

In the paper report, Sweden provides a description of the development needed for a number of parameters/substances (e.g. limit values needed for measurements in sediment, a number of substances can only be measured in water and not in biota). However, it does not specify further what is meant by “no significant increase”. 

Effects of contaminants
For effects of contaminants, Sweden has defined one general statement referring to “unacceptable biological effects at the individual, population, community, or ecosystem level” and four specific indicators: two only for the Baltic Sea and two for both marine regions. For the North Sea, only the seals are used as indicator for GES, whereas for the Baltic, the white-tailed eagle, the seal and the guillemot are used. Indicators for biological effects in the Baltic Sea include shell thickness of white-tailed eagle and guillemot eggs and productivity of white-tailed eagle populations. It is not clear why the indicator of shell thickness of guillemot eggs (8.2A) is not used also in the North Sea.  It should be noted that indicators 8.2A on shell thickness and 8.2D on oil discharges have not been reported in the reporting sheets. 

The indicators defined by Sweden for biological effects are closely related to various OSPAR’s EcoQOs, e.g. about the productivity of seals or eggshell thinning, but are not exactly the same as the EcoQOs and no reference is made to OSPAR, HELCOM or ICES. 

In the Baltic Sea reporting sheet, Sweden has reported the threshold values to be used for indicator 8.2B and indicator 8.2C (see analysis of these under Descriptor 1 – indicators 1.3B, C and D). No threshold value or baseline is defined for indicator 8.2A in the reporting sheet but it is defined in the paper report. It is also stated that it will be operational only in 2014. No explanation or justification is provided as to why certain indicators are not operational yet. 

As for criterion 8.1, Sweden mentions a number of parameters/effects that need further development before they can be used as GES indicators for criterion 8.2 (e.g. imposex effects of TBT on gastropods, health status of fish).  It is not clear however if (and when) and by whom these will be further developed. 

Acute pollution events are covered by indicator 8.2D, which relates to the number of detected discharges. No indicator is defined for the extent of the discharges and the effect of oil and oil-related products on biota. The OPSAR EcoQO on oiled guillemots is not used by Sweden. However, the goal of achieving zero discharges a year would de facto eliminate effects on biota. No threshold or baseline is provided for this indicator in the reporting sheet but they are in the paper report. GES is achieved when the number of detected illegal discharges per flight hour is permanently reduced and the assessment is based on the previous six-year period. This would mean therefore that the zero goal should be achieved by 2020, which is not clear from the GES definition itself. ";The GES definition for D8 for both marine regions is considered partially adequate. Sweden uses the EU EQS as reference values for concentrations of contaminants in biota however it does not mention compliance to the EQS in water and therefore does not provide details of how (and if) the EQS will be applied to this matrix. Considering that it uses only the EQS in biota as reference values (and not OSPAR or HELCOM’s EAC), it is logical that it has defined indicators with absolute threshold values only for two substances (although it is not clear why such indicator was not also defined for HCBD) and set a third trend-based indicator. But Sweden is not clear as to what it means with “no significant increase”. There is no issue of complementarity with the RSC standards as these are not used. In terms of effects of contaminants, despite the general phrasing of criterion 8.2 (unacceptable biological effects at the individual, population, community, or ecosystem level), the indicators are limited to one specific parameter for only three (for the Baltic) or even just one (for the North Sea) species. No direct reference is made to OSPAR, HELCOM or ICES for criteria for biological effects but the indicators used are actually quite close to a number of EcoQOs. Only a limited number of indicators are operational in 2012 and apply to both regions. The EcoQO on oiled guillemot is not used for acute pollution event, only the number of discharges is covered by the Swedish indicator. In addition, the GES definition for indicator B.2D is rather phrased like a target helping the achievement of a GES, which would be better defined as zero illegal discharges by 2020.;"- GES defined for both criteria of the Commission Decision and all indicators (including acute pollution events)
- Reference to EQS but only in biota, no reference to EQS in water (uncertainty whether all priority substances are covered)
- Thresholds defined only for two substances
- Effects of contaminants for three species and thresholds and baselines defined
- No reference to HELCOM";2;Partially adequate
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Sweden reports for the Baltic Sea and the North Sea together in the paper report and reports the same information for both regions in the reporting sheet.  The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
The description by Sweden of contamination by synthetic and non-synthetic substances is mostly qualitative (including qualitative trends). It is based on national reports (2008 Environmental Protection Agency report) and OSPAR and HELCOM’s most recent reports describing the effects of hazardous substances in the marine environment (i.e. OSPAR 2010 QSR; not specified for HELCOM). Sweden acknowledges that OSPAR and HELCOM have used slightly different criteria and assessment than those who may in the future be used by the implementation of the MSFD but the information is still very valuable to make an initial assessment of the state of the Swedish marine environment in relation to dangerous substances. 

Sweden does not describe the sources of contamination by man-made substance nor does it provide a quantitative assessment of input loads from these substances into the environment. It justifies this because of the data gaps but does not provide a description of what it will do to address these gaps. However it provides a number of qualitative trends for a number of substances measured in various matrices. The man-made substances assessed include HCB, dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, HCH, PBDE, TBT, alkylphenols, PAH, DDT, DEHP and others less important for the Swedish marine environment (PCB, HBCDD, PFOS). 

The heavy metals assessed include mercury, nickel, cadmium and lead. For heavy metals, Sweden also provides a qualitative description of diffuse and point sources of contamination (diffuse pollution from leakage from forestry and logging for cadmium, mercury, copper, nickel and lead, land and stormwater for mercury, agriculture for nickel; point sources are mostly industries and wastewater treatment plans) In addition, Sweden acknowledges that there are considerable data gaps concerning emissions from land deposits, antifouling agents, paints and coatings and resuspension from sediments. Despite this, it provides a quantitative assessment of inputs from these various metals in the environment (i.e. in tonnes / year Cd: 3.184 Cu: 128.026 Ni: 75.058 Pb: 63.672 Zn: 702.495 Hg: 0.61). 

For each substance assessed, Sweden provides a qualitative description of how it is monitored and measured and against which levels it is assessed (e.g. EQS, OSPAR EAC, Regulation 1259/2011 on foodstuffs, etc.) Sweden also provides a description of the levels of contaminants in marine organisms (in particular fish, mussels, herring and guillemot eggs). 

In terms of impacts on seabed habitats, Sweden only describes the decreasing trends in the levels of DEHP and TBT in sediment in both marine regions. Impacts on functional groups are better described, based on a 2008 report from the Environmental Protection Agency. The biological effects qualitatively described include imposex in dog whelks, fish health status, EROD, ulcers in seals and blubber thickness and eagles’ eggs shell thickness (which is the only one for which quantitative trends are provided). 

In terms of judgement, Sweden simply refers for both marine regions to the conclusion from the OSPAR 2010 QSR report that there are major problems with hazardous substances, despite decreasing concentration (e.g. of PAHs, PCBs and metals (Hg, Pb, Cd)). It also refers to HELCOM’s assessments of a number of substances (e.g. PCBs, DDT/DDE, cadmium, lead and TBT) concluding that their levels are problematic in more or less all monitoring stations. As mentioned before, the standards used to make these judgements are either the EU EQS or OSPAR’s EAC. No specific judgement is made for the impacts on ecosystem components. Sweden does not make an aggregated judgement at the level of the marine (sub)region on the current level of and impact from contamination from hazardous substances. 

In terms of data and knowledge gaps, Sweden acknowledges that it has not developed any criteria to assess the effects of hazardous substances on ecosystem components, which could be used as GES boundaries/thresholds. It also mentions the limited number of sites monitored and that, depending on the parameter monitored, it is either mainly in the offshore waters (e.g. substances in sediment) or mainly coastal (e.g. imposex). However, in the paper report Sweden proposes a number of parameters that should be monitored in order to define better indicators for the definition of GES for Descriptor 8. These include HCB in biota (fish, blue mussels, guillemot eggs) and sediment, dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in biota (fish, guillemot eggs), non-dioxin-like PCBs in biota, HBCDD in biota, PBDE in biota and sediment, PFOs in fish liver, HCH in biota and sediment, PAH in blue mussel and sediment, organotin compounds in dog whelk and sediment, alkylphenols in sediment, drug residues, DDT, and a number of additional substances. Sweden explains that the selection of these parameters is based on an assessment of the risks to the environment according to available data, and based on the HELCOM CORESET and OSPAR CEMP procedures, and whether they are already included in the current monitoring programme. 

Radionuclides
The description of contamination by radionuclides has been mixed with the description of contamination by hazardous substances in the paper report. The description is rather limited, looking only at the concentrations of Cesium-137 in water, mussels and fish. Inputs of radionuclides come mostly from nuclear facilities. Concentrations are decreasing and considered to be low (usually between .02 to 0.06 Bq / l), although not as low as pre-Chernobyl values. Sweden does not make a conclusive judgement on the current levels of contamination, justifying that no indicators of GES have been developed yet for Swedish marine waters. In terms of impacts on ecosystem components, Sweden refers to the conclusion in the OSPAR QSR that impacts on organisms is unlikely, looking at impacts on seaweed, crabs and flatfish and using the screening value of 10 micro gray per hour developed within the EU projects ERICA and PROTECT. 

Acute pollution events
The description of contamination by acute pollution events is very limited despite Sweden acknowledging that it is a major problem for birds. In the paper report, a figure (from HELCOM) is included that shows the geographical localisation of acute pollution events in the HELCOM waters. In addition, Sweden mentions that according to coastguard registries, emissions peaked in the mid-90s and that the trend is decreasing. No assessment of impacts on ecosystem components is made (apart from a simple statement that it is a major problem for birds without further references) and no judgement on the current levels of contamination from acute pollution events.";The initial assessment of contamination of the Swedish marine waters by dangerous substances is considered partially adequate. The assessment is not complete in that it is mostly qualitative and does not describe in details the sources of contamination. Qualitative trends are provided for a number of substances measured in various matrices. An aggregated judgement in relation to GES is not clearly made but Sweden makes a number of specific judgements by substance or group of substances referring to EU or RSC standards (EQS, EAC or European research projects). The assessment of contamination by acute pollution is very limited. Sweden provides an account of the data and knowledge gaps and acknowledges that additional GES criteria and indicators need to be developed. ;"Lack of details in the description of sources of contamination

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has defined two environmental targets and four associated indicators for both regions and one additional indicator specifically for the Baltic Sea. 

The two targets defined by Sweden correspond to the criteria for D8 of the Commission Decision (concentrations and effects of contaminants). The first target requires that concentrations of contaminants should not exceed the EQS values. While it is not specified which hazardous substances are covered by the target, the indicators mention metals (and Cd, Pb and Hg in reference to atmospheric depositions) and organic substances (dioxins and furans specified with regard to atmospheric depositions). For land-based sources however, the exact substances are not confirmed.  

From the text of the indicators, it seems that the EQS referred to include those measured in water (e.g. estimate trends in metal levels in the sea, total deposition in each sea basin). In addition, if the target is read literally, it also includes measuring the three substances for which an EQS has been established for measurement in biota (Hg, HCB and HCDB) and therefore it covers the GES definition. 

The three indicators focus on various sources of contamination, inland waters (rivers), coastal point sources and atmospheric deposition. However they are not measurable as they do not include specific threshold values and baselines. The text of the indicator merely explains the purpose of the indicator and in some cases the gaps (i.e. improvement of calculations to estimate total deposition in each country’s administrative sector; deficient monitoring of organic substances in offshore water and of emissions from point sources). 

In the accompanying text, Sweden specifies what it considers point emissions (direct emissions from such industries, sewage and accidents from maritime traffic or extraction platforms) and what it considers diffuse emissions (originating from agriculture, forestry and maritime traffic through continued leakage of hazardous substances). It explains that diffuse pollution is much more difficult to measure and control. It considers that Targets B.1 and B.2 cover both the concentration of contaminants and the input and effects of contaminants. The indicators for Target B.1 clearly address input of hazardous substances into the marine environment but since they are not measurable, it cannot be considered that they control inputs of hazardous substances. Sweden specifies that these three indicators will be operational only in 2018.

With regard to the effects of contaminants, the indicator defined for both regions is identical to the GES definition for indicator 8.2.2 of the Commission Decision. Its achievement should therefore ensure that GES is achieved but it is rather an expression of GES than a target defined to help achieve GES (e.g. by focusing on a pressure). The same applies for indicator 8.2A, which applies only to the Baltic region (consistently with the GES definition). For both indicators, a threshold value and a baseline is specified. The threshold for indicator 8.2D is the same as the GES threshold but a baseline is specified, which is not in the GES definition but makes it slightly more measurable (decreasing trend based on 6 previous years, i.e. from 2012). For indicator 8.2A, both threshold values and baselines have been reported, which was not the case in the GES definition. Following the logic from Sweden, it can be assumed that these are the same as the GES threshold and baseline. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Sweden to cover D8, for both marine regions, is considered partially adequate. It requires compliance with the EQS Directive, which would ensure achievement of GES. It is not fully consistent with the GES definition since the GES definition requires compliance with the EQS only in biota (for only two substances) but it is not contradictory. Target B2.1 refers to input of hazardous substances from various sources through its three indicators but does not go as far as defining thresholds and baselines to control these input, which would make this target operational and helpful towards achieving GES. Making these indicators operational only in 2018 gives them very limited time to help achieve GES by 2020. Target B2.2 refers to effects of contaminants, but the indicators associated are the copy of the GES indicators and are therefore not considered appropriate target indicators, defined to help achieve GES. ;"- The first target is SMART as it directly refers to the EQS
- Several indicators on sources of contamination but lack of threshold value
- Target on effects of contaminants is equivalent to GES definition but thresholds are defined at indicator level";2;Partially adequate
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D8;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the level of and impacts from contamination by hazardous substances is relatively consistent with the definition of GES (looking at the same substances and referring to Directive 2008/105/EC). However Sweden also refers regularly to the OSPAR environmental assessment criteria (EAC) as standards for concentration levels, which it does not use in its GES definition. Similarly it assesses a number of biological effects that are not included as indicators of GES (e.g. imposex, EROD, fish health status, blubber thickness) but Sweden had acknowledged in its GES section that these indicators needed further development before being used as GES indicators. Finally, it acknowledges in its initial assessment that concentration levels of TBT in sediment are so high that GES would not be achieved if this was included as an indicator of GES. Since TBT is in fact not included in the Swedish GES definition for D8, it seems to support the idea that only indicators which are susceptible to fall under acceptable levels by 2020 should be included as GES indicators.  

The targets and associated indicators are not fully consistent with the GES definition. As mentioned before, they seem to cover compliance with the EQSD in marine waters whereas the GES definition is restricted to biota. This is not in contradiction however and compliance with the EQSD should ensure achievement of GES. Although it is not clear how the EQSD is to be applied to offshore waters. The definition of target indicators to control various sources of pollution would also help achieve GES but the indicators are not specific enough in terms of what and how much they control. 

The indicators set for the environmental targets do not cover all parameters of the GES definition, in particular for the effects of contaminants (GES indicators 8.2B and 8.2C are not covered by the targets under D8). However, considering the links between these indicators and the biodiversity indicators, it is possible that they are covered by the biodiversity targets. ";;;;
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"
Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor, criterion and indicator levels for both marine regions. The definition at descriptor level is a mere copy of the text of Annex I of the MSFD but it is further specified through the criterion, referring to levels, numbers and frequency of hazardous substances, and the indicator, referring to concentrations of substances. 

The substances covered by the GES definition and the threshold values that should not be exceeded are those of Regulation 1881/2006. While the GES definition is not specific with regard to the fish and other seafood that should be monitored (except to specify that it concerns fish caught in the wild), the threshold values defined provide a sufficient level of detail in this regard. The GES refer to the maximum allowable concentrations (per wet weight) of a number of edible species (e.g. Pb and Cd in the blue mussel or dioxins in the North Sea/Baltic herring). The species covered include the blue mussel, herring, cod, bass, North Sea and Baltic herring, sprat, salmon, trout and perch. In addition, Sweden refers to the amendments to Regulation 1881/2006 through Regulation 1259/2011 (no reference is made to Regulation 835/2011). 

Despite the inclusion of the parameter of frequency under criterion 9.1, no indicator or threshold is defined which relates to the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded (as expressed in the Commission Decision indicator 9.1.2). Sweden justifies that since there are no established thresholds at the EU/regional level, it is not clear which standards should be applied for GES to be achieved in this regard. ";The definition of GES for D9 for both regions is considered partially adequate. Sweden refers to the relevant standards (Regulation 1881/2006) and provides specific details of the substances and fish and seafood covered by the GES definition. However, it does not specify what is meant with “frequency of hazardous substances” in criterion 9.1. It does not seem to correspond to indicator 9.1.2 of the 2010 Commission Decision, which means that criterion 9.1 of the 2010 Commission Decision is not fully covered by the Swedish GES definition.;"- GES definition covers criterion 9.1 only partially as it does not refer to the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeeded

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Sweden reports for the Baltic Sea and the North Sea together in the paper report and reports the same information for both regions in the reporting sheet.  The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
The description of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances is relatively limited and mixed with the description of contamination of the environment by hazardous substances in the paper report (see D8). It mentions briefly that the HCB levels measured in herring muscle are just below the limit specified in the EQS Directive (0.01 mg / kg wet weight) and therefore that status is good. It describes more extensively contamination by mercury, with reference to the limit values set in Regulation 1881/2006, stating that the maximum allowed concentrations have never been exceeded in the fish investigated at national level within the marine program. Despite issues with mercury in children’s food (close to average levels), Sweden considers that the current levels are acceptable as per D9 (but not according to D8 indicators). Other substances measured include cadmium and lead in fish muscle and in mussels. Cadmium in fish muscle is considered to pose no risk for human consumption and since allowed limit values in mussels for human consumption are significantly higher than the EQS, cadmium and lead levels are not expected to be exceeded. 

In addition, in the paper report, Sweden also mentions that levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are exceeded for certain species (not specified) in certain areas (not specified) according to the limit values of Regulation 1259/2011 (amendment to Regulation 1881/2006) concluding that the current levels for these substances are not acceptable as per D9 (status is not good). 

Sweden notes the discrepancy between the conclusions regarding the acceptability of levels of contaminants in the environment and levels for human consumption and also mentions the issue of cumulative effects from contamination from other sources (e.g. nutrients, marine litter). 

Radionuclides
No assessment has been made of contamination of fish and seafood by radionuclides. 

Microbial pathogens
Sweden has made an assessment for the level of pressure and impacts related to microbial pathogens, only for bathing waters in Swedish waters. There are no separate assessments for the two sub-regions. The assessment for shellfish waters only states that sometimes shellfish harvesting is not allowed due to microbial pathogen contaminations. ";The initial assessment of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption (including by microbial pathogens) by Sweden is considered partially adequate. Only a few substances are covered and only two (mercury and dioxins) are assessed against the relevant reference levels (Regulation 1881/2006 and amendment). Sweden does not discuss the issue of the origin of samples monitored. The assessment does not cover all relevant substances or all relevant fish/seafood. ;"- Limited assessment of only two substances (mercury and dioxins)

Sweden (Baltic Sea);D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has not defined specific targets to cover D9 however it explains that the targets covering D8 are also relevant for D9. 

The target for D8 requires compliance with the EQS Directive, which covers biota (fish) only for three substances (Hg, HCB and HCBD, but where Sweden has only chose to assess two of these). This means that all the other substances mentioned under the GES definition for D9 are not covered by the target on compliance with the EQS Directive. However, the indicators on the sources of pollution are relevant for D9 (since the ingestion of hazardous substances by marine organisms is caused by the same input of contaminants as what pollutes the marine waters in general). ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Sweden to cover pollution by contaminants is considered inadequate to cover D9. While the use of the EQS should ensure a lower level of contaminants in biota than Regulation 1881/2006 (because environmental monitoring is stricter than health monitoring), these have been defined only for three substances (Hg, HCB and HCDB). For a number of substances (e.g. dioxins, PCBs, PAHs, Cd, Pb), EQS in biota have not yet been approved but foodstuff limits exist in Regulation 1881/2006 which could have been used by Sweden. In addition, while the indicators on sources of pollution are also relevant for D9, their lack of specificity means that they are not operational and useful yet. It is therefore not clear how these targets and associated indicators will help achieve GES for D9. ;"- Same targets as for D8
- Coverage only of two substances in biota, lack of coverage of a number of substances
- No reference to EU foodstuffs regulations";1;Inadequate
Sweden (Baltic Sea);D9;Consistency ;;"The initial assessment of contamination by dangerous substances of fish and seafood for human consumption is limited to the assessment of only two substances (or group of) in fish (or species not specified in the assessment). This is not consistent with the GES definition, which provides a list of the reference levels that should not be exceeded for a number of substances in a number of different species of fish and shellfish. 

There is also a clear inconsistency between the targets, which are defined specifically towards D8 and refer only to Directive 2008/105/EC in terms of reference levels, and the GES definition which is very specific to D9 and refers to the relevant standards (Regulation 1881/2006). ";;;;
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at the level of the descriptor, the criteria and the indicators. It covers all criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision and most of the indicators. The indicators that are not addressed in the definition include 1.1.2 (distributional pattern), 1.1.3 (area covered by species), 1.3.2 (genetic structure), 1.4.1 (distributional range), 1.4.2 (distributional pattern), 1.5.2 (habitat volume), 1.6.3 (physical, hydrological and chemical conditions). It should be noted that a number of indicators have not been reported in the reporting sheets (for either region) and are only present in the paper reports (1.2D, 1.3E, 1.6A and 1.6B). 

Species/functional groups
According to the reporting sheets, the species groups covered by criteria 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 for both marine regions are birds, mammals and fish. No reference is made to cephalopods or reptiles. However, it is expected that these are not relevant for the Baltic and most likely not relevant for the North Sea area. In addition, Sweden has defined a number of indicators focusing on specific species, including the harbour porpoise for the North Sea and for both regions seals and wintering waterfowls. The “mammals” indicator (1.3D) focuses specifically on the harbour porpoise and seal for the North Sea and the grey seal, the ringed seal and the harbour seal in the Baltic Sea. Seabirds and fish are further covered globally by indicators 1.2C (seabirds) and 1.2D and 1.3E (fish). 

In terms of threshold values or baselines (for trend-based indicators), only a few indicators have been further specified in the reporting sheets and the paper report. The majority of indicators do not have specific thresholds or baselines defined to be used as GES boundaries. For indicators 1.2B and 1.2C, Sweden proposes a defined list of species to be used as indicators for the Baltic Sea. However no baseline is defined to be able to measure GES. Sweden acknowledges that most of these indicators are not functional in 2012 and will be either in 2014 for the Baltic Sea (if they are developed under the HELCOM CORESET) or 2018 for the North Sea. 

Only for the white-tailed eagle (in the Baltic Sea) and seals does Sweden provide quantitative thresholds and baselines based on the HELCOM CORESET project (indicator 1.3A: breeding success > 60%, aerie size > 1.64 young and productivity > 1.0 young; indicator 1.3B: Grey seal: blubber thickness for females and males 1-3 years = 26 mm, males 5-20 years = 36 mm, females 5-20 years = 37 mm; and indicator 1.3C: grey seals: gestation frequency > 80%; harbour seal and ringed seal: TBD). The baselines are also specified for these three indicators (for the white-tailed eagle, either the 2004 stocks from the Environmental Protection Agency or the 2012 HELCOM CORESET and for the seals the 2012 HELCOM CORESET). No threshold or baseline is specified for indicator 1.3C for the North Sea which is explained by the fact that, according to the paper report, indicator 1.3C in the North Sea covers only the harbour seal and the indicator will be operational only in 2018. For the Baltic Sea, indicator 1.3C covers both the grey seal (operational in 2012) and the harbour seal (operational only in 2018).

In the paper report, possible threshold values are provided for indicator 1.3D on the growth rate for marine mammals (more specifically of grey seals and ringed seals populations, in relation to the ecosystem’s carrying capacity). The values are based on HELCOM but apply to both regions. The indicator is still under development anyway. Finally, the size/biomass of fish species is also covered by criterion 1.6 on the condition of the typical species and communities.

In general the baseline is understood in the sense of ‘reference condition’, i.e. in line with prevailing conditions, within the range of ‘natural conditions’ or in such a state that long term survival and reproduction is guaranteed or in a condition to support ecological functioning. For criterion 1.1 there is ambition to restore areas which have resulted in a change in species distribution due to human activities to a ‘long term sustainable level’. In general there is a lack of specificity of the terms used in the definition and the lack of threshold values or baselines means that it is not possible to know when GES is considered achieved. 

For species, the only other reference made to an international/regional agreement (apart from the use of HELCOM CORESET for eagle and seals) is to the ASCOBANS standards for the abundance of harbour porpoise, applicable only to the North Sea. No reference is made to OSPAR or to the Habitats and Birds Directives. No direct reference is made to protected/listed species when these are mentioned in the initial assessment. Sweden does not mention in its GES that it will report on protected/listed species as per the timeline of the Habitats and Birds Directive but it does so in the initial assessment. 

Sweden provides detailed information with regard to the development needs of the missing indicators and or the lack of details. It describes the information that is lacking and the projects/programmes in place to address these gaps. Not all indicators are covered by this justification however (e.g. 1.1.3 is not covered). 

Habitats 
According to Sweden’s reporting in the reporting sheets, the GES definitions for habitats at criteria level cover all seabed and water column habitats. A few indicators are focused on specific habitats or habitat-forming communities (e.g. macro vegetation in coastal waters). Habitats considered are mostly coastal (shallow or shelf) and it seems that no specific indicator has been developed for water column habitats (zooplankton and phytoplankton are mentioned as part of the coastal pelagic habitats but no indicator on these have been developed yet). Intertidal habitats are not covered but would not be relevant anyway.  

Sweden mentions that the Commission has recommended the use of the EUNIS level 2 classification of habitats, which it has done while still adapting to Swedish circumstances. It does not use the predominant habitat types defined for the purpose of the MSFD. The habitat types covered by the GES criteria and indicators for habitats include: photic hard and sediment bottom (and the associated communities macro-vegetation and bottom fauna), aphotic hard and sediment bottom (and the associated community bottom fauna) and pelagic coastal and offshore waters (and the associated communities fish, zooplankton and phytoplankton). This classification seems to follow the HELCOM classification of habitats. It has been applied to both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (which is explained by the fact that HELCOM waters overlap with North Sea water on the Kattegat area). 

The GES definitions for Criteria 1.4 and 1.5 on habitat distribution and extent are much more limited than for other criteria. Sweden provides justification for the lack of indicators under criterion 1.4 in the gap analysis of its paper report. It mentions that distribution of benthic habitats is only very limitedly monitored. At the moment, statistical modelling is used to produce maps of habitats distribution which provide information about the probability of occurrence but no information on biomass of habitat-forming species. According to current research projects, 50% of Swedish coastal areas should be mapped by 2014 using modelling. 

Sweden also explains that most of the “biologically valuable marine habitats” in Swedish waters are covered by the Habitats Directive and that habitat distribution is part of the assessment of Favourable Conservation Status (FCV), the next reporting cycle of which will take place in 2013. Sweden does however mention that the Habitats Directive does not cover soft sediment in the aphotic zone, which is most widespread in Sweden and contains habitats listed as threatened under the OSPAR Convention (e.g. sea pens communities).

With regard to criterion 1.5 and 1.6 on habitat extent and condition, Sweden also explains that data is lacking to develop better indicators (e.g. indicator 1.5A only measures the proliferation of macro vegetation in depth, no monitoring of the benthic communities in hard bottoms, lack of phytoplankton-based indicators) and gives an indication of the development needs and plans to address these. 

Criterion 1.6 is still more developed than the other two. Specific indicators have been defined and quantitative threshold values have been specified for a few indicators (e.g. for indicator 1.6B based on OSPAR’s EcoQO and the requirements of the EU Data Collection Regulation (2010/93)). The use of the Bottom Fauna Indices (BQI) is also quite specific and based on the national transposition of the Water Framework Directive (NFS 2008). 

Ecosystem
The ecosystem structure is covered by criterion 1.7, which mentions the components of the food web and the extent and condition of habitats. No specific details/reference levels are provided to determine what is meant with “ecosystem services are provided”. The indicator defined under criterion 1.7 relates only to the trophic levels of the fish community but no thresholds or baselines are further specified. Sweden refers to the HELCOM FISH-PRO project. 

However, in its gap analysis in the paper report, Sweden shows how criterion 1.7 is related to all the other criteria of the Commission Decision (of all descriptors). ";The GES definition for Descriptor 1 by Sweden is considered partially adequate. Sweden has defined GES for all the criteria of the Commission Decision and many indicators. The GES definition covers the most relevant species groups and habitat types (although water column habitats are not well-covered yet). It refers to the Habitats Directive for the reporting on habitats, to the Water Framework Directive and uses a number of standards from HELCOM CORESET. It mentions the OSPAR EcoQOs only in one instance. The majority of indicators are not specific in terms of threshold or, more importantly for the types of indicators defined, baselines. Only a very limited number of indicators are already operational in 2012. The others are expected to be operational by 2014 or even 2018 (which is late to achieve GES by 2020).  To date, it is not possible to fully assess when GES is considered to be achieved. ;"- GES defined for all criteria of the Commission Decision and many indicators

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
Sweden has reported on the following species groups for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea: birds, fish and marine mammals (in the electronic reporting, Sweden mentions that mammals are reported under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive). The information included in the reporting sheets is mainly qualitative and covers descriptions on group condition and abundance as well as the main pressures affecting the species group and the status in relation to natural conditions. Trends (only for birds) and judgements on current status are also provided. Sweden reports an overall “not acceptable status” for birds in both regions, but while the trend is stable in the North Sea, it is declining in the Baltic Sea. In relation to fish, in the North Sea in the Skagerrak the status is considered as not fully achieving good environmental status; in the Kattegat where the condition of eels, cartilaginous fishes and cods is reported as critical, the status is “poor”. The condition of fish in the Baltic Sea is better: in the Baltic Proper the status of fish is considered as not fully achieving good environmental status but in the Gulf of Bothnia the status is good.

The main knowledge gaps and plans to address them are also reported –these include e.g. a future national monitoring programme for birds. The information in the paper report is more detailed and refers recurrently to individual species. Literature is often cited and OSPAR, HELCOM and ICES documents and projects are mentioned. The report includes national and international red lists of threatened species; in relation to species covered under the Habitats and Birds Directive, Sweden indicates that these will be reported according to the timescale and format agreed under those Directives.

Habitats
Sweden has carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The assessment is mainly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Literature is often cited and OSPAR and HELCOM documents and projects are mentioned throughout the report. Notwithstanding, Sweden acknowledges a series of information gaps related to insufficient monitoring on e.g. some species of macrofauna or land-based spread of angiosperms, and indicates the need to developed appropriate methods and indicators to improve knowledge.

The information reported by Sweden is more developed in the paper report than in the reporting sheets. In the paper report Sweden describes its predominant habitats, which include seabed habitats and water column habitats, special habitats listed under the Habitats Directive, OSPAR and HELCOM, and other habitats. In the reporting sheets, for the North Sea, Sweden reports on water column habitats all, seabed fauna habitats, macroalgae habitats, angiosperms habitats, and OSPAR Convention Annex I habitats. For the Baltic Sea, Sweden reports on water column habitats all and Helsinki Convention Annex I habitats; in addition it also reports on macroalgae habitats, angiosperms habitats and seabed fauna habitats, separately, for the Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Bothnia.

For most habitats the assessment includes descriptions of habitat distribution, extent and condition, as well as the main pressure affecting the habitats. Trends are provided as are judgements on the current status, although only in a few cases in reference to GES. Thus, e.g. the status of both phytoplankton and zooplankton (reported under water column habitats) in the Baltic is considered “not acceptable”; for the North Sea, there is not such a specific conclusive judgement on phytoplankton and zooplankton but it is indicated that 14% of the coastal water bodies had a status “less than good” in 2012. For some habitat types, some parameters are quantified and the status in relation to natural conditions is provided.

Ecosystems
Sweden states that no initial assessment has been made of ecosystems since adequate criteria and indicators are not yet fully developed. In addition, Sweden indicates that although some effects at ecosystem level are assessed in different sections of the report, these assessments are based on the HARMONY project and OSPAR QSR 2010, for the North Sea, and on HELCOM HOLAS 2010 for the Baltic Sea.";The initial assessment by Sweden of biological features is considered partially adequate. Not all habitat types and species groups are covered, and there is not enough information on the relevant pressures. In addition, there is no information on ecosystems. The information reported is mostly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Judgements on status were provided in some cases.

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has reported two environmental targets and eleven associated indicators to cover Descriptor 1 and Descriptor 4. The targets are the same for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. In addition to these two specific targets, Sweden reports that the biodiversity descriptors are also covered by the targets on eutrophication (D1) and hazardous substances (D1 and D4). Sweden says that its targets cover indicators 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7 and 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 but this is the case only for fish species and not for other species groups. 

In the reporting sheets, each associated indicator is further specified. Details are provided on what the indicator entails, how it should be measured (qualitatively and sometimes quantitatively) and reference to specific methods/approaches from HELCOM (indicators 1.3E, 1.6E and 1.6A), OSPAR (OSPAR EcoQO on the proportion of large individuals in the fish community, indicator 1.6B) and national approaches from the Environmental Protection Agency (indicators on the size structure of predatory fish). For a number of indicators, quantitative parameters are specified that should be used to measure the indicator, making them potentially measurable. However, thresholds for the achievement of the indicator/target are not proposed. Baselines are not indicated either. 

Many indicators are very similar to the GES indicators. They are related to the fish community, either in coastal or in outer waters. In terms of the species covered by the targets/indicators, the indicators cover key/sensitive species in coastal and offshore waters (specified perch in the Baltic Sea for indicator 1.3E), important functional groups of fish in coastal and offshore waters (specified carp in the Baltic Sea for indicator 1.6E), predatory fish in coastal and offshore waters (unspecified), large individual in offshore waters (unspecified). Apart from the specific mention of two species in the Baltic, the rest of the indicators are relatively unspecific with regard to the species/functional groups covered. 

All indicators are state indicators but in a way, many of them are related to the fishing pressure and other pressures and impacts from human activities (e.g. nutrient enrichment, hydrographical changes such as temperature and salinity). However, none of the indicators are directly geared towards reducing the pressure from a specific human activity. 

As for the GES definition, many indicators are still under development and will not be operational before 2014 (or even 2018 for some of them, which leaves very little time for the implementation of the target before the 2020 deadline for the achievement of GES). ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Sweden to cover D1 and D4 is considered inadequate. The targets/indicators defined are relatively specific and potentially measurable, and they cover most of the Commission Decision criteria and indicators for D1 and D4. However they only focus on the fish community, mammals and birds are not at all addressed.  ;"- Targets and indicators are potentially measurable and specific

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D1;Consistency ;;"The assessment of biological features is consistent with the definitions of GES for Descriptors 1 and 4 since it covers the same habitat types and species groups as those targeted by the GES definitions. However the set of targets and indicators is not consistent with the initial assessment since it does not cover birds and mammals despite the fact that the status of these species groups has been assessed as not good in the initial assessment.  

For Descriptor 6, the targets/indicators defined do not make use of the indicator BQI used in the GES definition. Both the targets and GES are defined at a very general level and lack any references to specific features. The targets and GES both show a low level of ambition. ";;;;
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 10 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. The definition of GES is applicable for both the North Sean and the Baltic Sea, except for the indicator 10.1A which only applies to the North Sea. Both criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision are incorporated in the GES definition. 

GES at descriptor level is copied from Annex I of the MSFD. The indicators provided by Swedish (10.1A and 10.1B – only in the paper report) address indicators 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of the Commission Decision. They could be considered as more specific than the Decision as they focus on the amount of litter and impact on organisms, respectively. However, no threshold values or baselines have been set to specify the trend-based GES boundary (e.g. what is meant with “decrease” and “long-term goal”). For instance, it is not clear whether GES for indicators 10.1A and 10.1B is that the environment is free of litter by 2020. 

Indicators 10.1.3 and 10.2.1 are not at all covered by the GES definition. Sweden acknowledges this by stating that these indicators are still under development. It provides some details of the development needs (e.g. use of the Continuous Plankton Recorder for collection of microparticles) and some research projects on-going which will help develop these indicators further (e.g. the Keep Sweden Tidy project for marine litter on beaches). Therefore GES has not yet been defined for micro-particles and for plastic on surface and in water column.

In addition, Sweden mentions plans to further develop the indicators for GES in coastal areas, based on the UNEP protocol. The report refers also the ICES bottom trawling programme BITS. In relation to the North Sea, many of the OSPAR data and methodologies, e.g. on beach litter monitoring are not used but it is not clear if and /or why that method is not considered workable for Sweden.

Sweden states the need to extend its monitoring programme to cover e.g. the impact on plants and animals, indicating that it is currently discussing suitable indicator species such as mussels, herring and sprat since the northern fulmar is only an occasional visitor.

Sweden has reported on the level of pressure of marine litter on the coastline, the water column and the seabed. For each of these matrices, Sweden describes the current situation and quantifies the amount of litter; for the coastline, a judgement on the current status is also provided (“not acceptable”). There are no references to the impact on water column habitats and in relation to the impact on seabed habitats and on functional groups/marine animals only the results of the latest surveys are referred to.

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has defined one target and two associated indicators to address Descriptor 10. The target is the same in the reporting sheets and in the paper report; however, the indicators are more developed in the reporting sheets. According to the reporting sheets the first indicator applies only to the North Sea, which is consistent with the definition of GES, but that is not so clear in the paper report. However, projects are under way for the production of reference beaches of the Baltic Sea.

The target is made measurable through the associated indicators. Both indicators monitor the end-of-pipe impact and are expected not to have influence on the pressures/sources of marine litter. There are no indicators for the water column, micro-particles or impact on marine animals yet. The two existing indicators are specific and measurable but as no threshold values have been defined it is not possible to say if they are realistic and achievable. Being free from litter is an ambitious long term objective but since there are no measurable indicators and no threshold values, the actual ambition on the short to medium-term cannot be assessed. Sweden follows the methodologies of OSPAR and ICES, referring expressly to IBTS and BITS programmes in the report.

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden set GES for Descriptor 2 at descriptor and criteria level, in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. The GES definition is the same for both the North Sea and Baltic sub-regions. The descriptor definition is a verbatim copy of the Descriptor as provided in Annex I of the MSFD. The criteria have been defined in more details than those provided in the Commission Decision although criterion 2.1 deviates significantly from the criterion provided in the Commission Decision. 

The GES definition aims for no more introductions of NIS which may adversely affect biological diversity as well as a minimisation of the impact from these species on biodiversity and ecosystems. The definition also applies to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as well as organisms with altered genetic properties. There is no clarification as to what is considered an adverse effect on biological diversity and when species are considered to pose this risk. The Swedish GES criteria do not mention the abundance or state of NIS that are already established in the ecosystem, although this could be implicitly covered by criterion 2.2. Similarly, it does not specifically include the current pressure of NIS and the prevention of spreading or reduction of this already existing pressure, when possible. 

Furthermore, in the accompanying text, Sweden proposes the development of a number of indicators but it does not clarify when these will be operational. In regard to criterion 2.1 several indicators are proposed, monitoring of the granted release permits for NIS, GMOs and species with altered genetic properties by various authorities, introduction of invasive species in sensitive habitats and conservation areas and the number of newly introduced invasive species in international ports and major shipping routes. 

With regard to criterion 2.2, Sweden proposes the establishment of a biopollution level index that measures the impacts of NIS in a given sea. The index should classify the occurrence and spread of NIS and the size of their impact on the original community, habitats and ecosystems. The indicator should provide a quantitative assessment of GES and allow for a comparison between areas. The indicator should be based on a baseline corresponding to the present situation and based on existing monitoring programs. 

The proposed indicators take into account the known vectors of NIS and establish that in regard to criterion 2.2 the baseline will be the current situation. At this moment however these indicators cannot be considered part of the GES definition as they are still in the proposal phase. 

It should be noted that the GES as it is defined by Sweden increases the scope of the descriptor to include GMOs as well as other species with altered genetic properties. This increase in the scope can be considered particularly relevant to aquaculture and activities related to restocking species such as Salmon. This can be considered a good practice as the risks associated with these species are likely to be similar to those from the introduction of NIS. ";The Swedish GES definition for Descriptor 2 is considered partially adequate. The GES is defined at descriptor and criteria level although the criterion 2.1 does not correspond to the one given in the Commission Decision. In particular the GES definition does not refer to the abundance and state of NIS. The further spreading of existing pressures have not been addressed Sweden has made an effort to define potential indicators, but these are not incorporated in the current GES definition nor do they have a date set for when they will be operational. The scope of the GES definition is wider than that from the MSFD since it also refers to GMOs and species with altered genetic characteristics, this can be considered a good practice.;"- GES defined at descriptor and criteria levels

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Swedish initial assessment has been done at a very general level. In the assessment it is mentioned that currently 75 non-indigenous species have been recorded in Swedish waters, 49 in the North Sea and 38 in the Baltic Sea and 10 in both seas. The Swedish reporting sheets lists 6 NIS and 9 genetically distinct forms of native species for the Baltic region. For the North Sea, it lists 9 NIS and 10 genetically distinct forms of native species. However, in the reporting sheet, Sweden specifies that these lists focuses on those species considering as presenting the most important pressures and refers to background document (available through internet link) for more complete lists.

The six non-indigenous species that are expected to constitute the most important problems to fisheries and aquaculture are the American comb jelly, Pacific oyster, signal crayfish, fishhook water flea, American lobster and Round goby. The initial assessment refers to www.frammandearter.se for more information on NIS in Swedish marine waters. 

Shipping is stated to be the main cause of unintentional introductions of aquatic invasive species via ballast water or as fouling on ship hulls. The 11 species most likely to be spread by ballast water in Swedish waters are the fishhook waterflea, Atlantic jackknife clam, Karenia mikimotoi (dinoflagellate), Alexandrium minutum (Flagellate), American comb jelly, Pacific oyster, Chinese Mitten crab, bay barnacle, round goby, Prorocentrum minimum (dinoflagellate) and Coscinodiscus wailesii (diatom). Other important vectors such as aquaculture are not mentioned. 

Sweden qualifies the trend status as declining, with a low level of confidence. But, at the same time, it has considered that the level of the pressure on the environment has been increasing until 2010.

It is also mentioned in the initial assessment that current monitoring programs on biodiversity components are not very appropriate for monitoring NIS since they do not focus on areas considered at high risk of experiencing new NIS introductions. There is no detailed information on data/knowledge gaps and how these will be addressed.";The Swedish initial assessment on non-indigenous species is considered partially adequate.

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has set two targets which apply to both sub-regions and should be achieved by 2020, hence are time-bound. 

Target C.1 aims for no new introductions of NIS, GMOs and species with altered genetic properties that pose a risk to the genetic, biological diversity or function of the ecosystem. This target requires knowledge on which of these species are already present in Swedish marine waters as well as their potential to pose a risk to be SMART. The associated indicator to monitor permits for new release of NIS, GMOs and other organisms with altered genetic characteristics is not sufficient to monitor all potential vectors such as shipping, unintentional releases from the pet trade or trans-boundary movement of invasive species. The target is not specific as it is worded in a very general way and expresses rather GES than an environmental target. 

However, the associated indicator relates to ‘permissions to release non-indigenous species’ and seems to suggest that the target actually covers only NIS introduced for aquaculture purposes. Even in that case, it is not clear how the indicator would allow measuring the targets. In conclusion, the target and its associated indicator are very difficult to interpret and do not seem adequate.

Target C.2 specifically deals with the spread of NIS due to shipping but contains the qualifier “as far as possible.” This poses the question on how to interpret what is possible and not possible. As a consequence, the target is not measurable. The target has not incorporated the condition that it applies only to species which pose a risk and can therefore be interpreted to apply to all NIS. The two associated indicators are the number of newly introduced invasive species in sensitive habitats, protected areas, international ports and major shipping routes. Unlike the target, the two indicators are focused on invasive species rather than NIS in general, this requires a knowledge of which species are invasive and is less stringent than the target. 

Neither of the two targets deal with the abundance of NIS either newly introduced or already established within the ecosystem. They addressed specific pathways (at least if the first one is interpreted as targeting NIS used in aquaculture). ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Sweden to cover D2 is considered partially adequate. The targets only address introductions of new NIS as well as GMOs and species with altered genetic properties. The targets however do not address the abundance of NIS or their impact on the ecosystem. One of the targets is not clearly worded. They are not measurable given their lack of specification, and are too vague to ensure that GES is reached.;"- Targets only address introductions of new NIS as well as GMOs and species with altered genetic properties

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D2;Consistency ;;Both the GES and targets refer to NIS as well as GMOs and species with altered genetic properties, the latter two types of species are not referred to in the initial assessment, and they both refer not only to the introduction of new NIS but also the effects on the ecosystem. Both the GES and targets do not explicitly deal with the abundance of NIS in the ecosystem and can therefore not be considered to fully cover the descriptor as given in Annex I of the Directive. The targets appear as an expression of the GES definition with a focus on specific pressure. This is consistent but the targets are too vague to ensure reaching GES.;;;;
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The Swedish GES definition for Descriptor 3 is set at the descriptor, criteria and indicator levels and is the same for both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea marine regions. The descriptor is a verbatim copy of the descriptor from Annex I. All three criteria from the 2010 Commission Decision have been applied and criteria 3.1 and 3.2 have associated indicators provided. 

Criterion 3.1 and the associated indicator 3.1A states that all commercial fish species should be exploited below Fmsy which is in line with the Commission Decision but it should also apply to shellfish stocks. Indicator 3.1B, which corresponds to secondary indicator 3.2.2 from the Commission Decision, applies to stocks for which there are no ICES analytical assessments. Regarding indicator 3.1B it is unclear which baseline or desired direction will be applied but it is stated that this indicator needs to be developed further and should be operational by 2018. 

Criterion 3.2 has been defined in a qualitative way stating that the reproductive capacity of fish stocks should be at levels that guarantee viable sustainable stocks but it does not specify that the criterion applies to all commercial fish species as is specified for criterion 3.1. The indicator 3.2A states that the SSB of stocks should be above the BMSY-trigger level which is in line with the commission decision but it is not specified whether this applies for all stocks for which ICES advice is available. Indicator 3.2B does not clarify which baseline or desired direction will be applied but it is stated that this indicator needs to be developed further and should be operational by 2018. 

Criterion 3.3 has been applied but rather than stating that it should be ensured that stocks are healthy it is stated that the population age and size structure should guarantee long term productivity which could potentially be interpreted differently. This might explain why indicators 3.1C and 3.1D are applied to criterion 3.1 rather than criterion 3.3. ";The Swedish GES definition for D3 is considered partially adequate. The GES definition for criterion 3.1 states that all fish stocks should be exploited below Fmsy but it should also include shellfish stocks. Criterion 3.2, indicator 3.1B specifies that stocks should be exploited at BMSY-trigger but is not sufficiently specific that this applies to all stocks for which an analytical assessment is available, the descriptor however requires that all stocks are within safe biological limits so that this is not an issue. Criterion 3.3 has been applied although rather than referring to healthy stocks it refers to maintaining long term productivity. In relation to indicator 3.1D, if this is considered to support criterion 3.3, it could be considered as a good practice as it contains a well-defined threshold.;"- All stocks should be within safe biological limits

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The Swedish initial assessment has been performed at a generally high level, which Sweden has explained by a lack of developed indicators for fisheries and because it was not determined what type of information was requested. Sweden also mentions, in the information gaps and future plans section of the reporting sheets, that while it collects data for the DCF it has not reported at this level of detail for the MSFD but will do so for the next assessment in 2018. 

The assessment does provide an overview of the status of stocks in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat using the ICES analytical assessments in regard to MSY reference points. Thus, while the stocks of Haddock and Blue whiting are considered sustainable, the stocks of Spring-spawning Herring, Cod and Coalfish are not. A similar overview is missing for the Baltic although various stocks are reported on in regard to trends and general condition for both regions. An overview of landings of pelagic and demersal stocks has been provided through use of maps showing ICES landing data for ICES squares in Swedish waters. ";The Swedish initial assessment is considered adequate for the North Sea region and partially adequate for the Baltic Sea region. Sweden makes use of ICES data to report on the status of Atlantic stocks in regard to MSY reference points and the reporting on landings of demersal and pelagic stocks data from Swedish waters is good. Also Sweden has reported various data on fish stocks in regards to trends and developments although without a clear structure.

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The main target for Descriptor 3 (Target C.3) is very similar to the actual GES definition for the descriptor and lacks specific details. The indicators also follow the structure of the GES definition and apply both the primary and secondary indicators. The threshold for the primary indicator 3.1A is set at Fmsy and applies to stocks for which there is an analytical assessment, 100% of the stocks with analytical assessments need to be exploited below Fmsy in order to achieve GES. The primary indicator (3.2A) for SSB states that the indicator applies to all stocks from the DCF and states that 100% of the stocks should be above BMSY-trigger in accordance with the relevant ICES advice. However it can be assumed that BMSY-trigger reference points will not be known for all species so this target might only apply to stocks for which there is an analytical assessment, this however is not stated as it is for indicator 3.1A, therefore a strict interpretation would result in the assumption that Sweden intends this target to apply to all DCF stocks. 

In regard to the secondary indicator 3.1B it is stated that both methods and data for calculating the indicator is available for many species while in regard to indicator 3.2B it only stated that there are methods to do trend analysis or compare an evaluation period with older reference data, the text is unclear on whether older reference data exists. The indicators 3.1B and 3.2B do not have threshold values so while there are appropriate indicators they do not contribute to making the target SMART.

The C4 target and associated indicators apply to D3 as well as D1 and D4. Target C4 is more directly related to D4 and therefore not discussed here. The C4 indicators are most relevant for Criterion 3.3 of the Commission Decision. The indicators are each provided in duplicate once for coastal waters and once for offshore waters. Each of the C4 indicators deals with the size structure of the fish community with a particular focus on large individuals. The indicators 1.6A and 1.6B rely on fisheries data while two parallel indicators measuring the same fish community attributes rely on data collected from fishery independent data collection. The indicator measuring changes in the Length Distribution of the fish community in offshore waters (95% percentile) is the same as the indicator proposed for GES criterion 3.3 in the Commission Decision but then applied as a target indicator. Each of these indicators will be relevant for measuring aspects related to criterion 3.3 but currently no thresholds have been set. "; The targets are partially adequate. The targets are set in direct relation to the GES definition and aim for all stocks with analytical assessments to be exploited below Fmsy and have a SSB higher than BMSY-trigger.

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 4 at the descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. All three criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision are addresses by the GES definition and all of the (primary) indicators. It should be noted that indicators 4.2B and 4.3A have not been reported in the reporting sheets.

In terms of the features covered by the Descriptor, in the reporting sheets Sweden reports that D4 at descriptor level covers all functional groups and all seabed and water column habitats. The definitions at criteria and indicator levels however are more specific. 

Specific species are mentioned/addressed in a few indicators: the white-tailed eagle in the Baltic Sea (indicator 4.1A) and the harbour porpoise and seal for the North Sea and the grey seal, the ringed seal and the harbour seal in the Baltic Sea through indicator 4.1B on mammals. According to this therefore, criterion 4.1 on the productivity of key species/trophic group addresses only these species. Criterion 4.2 on selected predator species focuses only on fish and criterion 4.3 balanced food web functioning focuses on the fish community in coastal waters and on waterfowl species. No reference is made to plankton or benthos, only the higher level taxon is addressed by the GES definition of D4.

In terms of baselines, the definition at descriptor level refers to ‘normal abundance’ and at criteria level to ‘natural fluctuations’ and ‘natural trophic regulation’. As for D1 therefore, the baselines seem to be used in the sense of ‘reference conditions’, i.e. in line with prevailing conditions, free from human influence (“intrinsic growth rate of a population that is unaffected by man”). No reference is made to a possible acceptable deviation for the criteria. 

The baselines for most indicators are not specified and the indicators are not quantified except for indicator 4.1A on the productivity of the white-tailed eagle and indicator 4.1B on the growth rate of certain marine mammals, for which threshold values have been defined. The rest of the indicators, as for most indicators for D1, are still under development and are not expected to be operational before 2014 (or even 2018 for the North Sea). 

No direct reference is made in the definitions to OSPAR, HELCOM, EU standards or any international agreement. Indirect reference is made to various HELCOM programmes through the methods to be used to measure/monitor the indicators (e.g. HELCOM FISH-PRO). 

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Ecosystems
The ecosystem structure is covered by criterion 1.7, which mentions the components of the food web and the extent and condition of habitats. No specific details/reference levels are provided to determine what is meant with “ecosystem services are provided”. The indicator defined under criterion 1.7 relates only to the trophic levels of the fish community but no thresholds or baselines are further specified. Sweden refers to the HELCOM FISH-PRO project. 

However, in its gap analysis in the paper report, Sweden shows how criterion 1.7 is related to all the other criteria of the Commission Decision (of all descriptors). ";Taking into account that D4 requires unfamiliar assessment approaches the GES definition for Descriptor 4 by Sweden is considered adequate.

Sweden says that its targets cover indicators 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7 and 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 but this is the case only for fish species and not for other species groups.

Details are provided on what the indicator entails, how it should be measured (qualitatively and sometimes quantitatively) and reference to specific methods/approaches from HELCOM (indicators 1.3E, 1.6E and 1.6A), OSPAR (OSPAR EcoQO on the proportion of large individuals in the fish community, indicator 1.6B) and national approaches from the Environmental Protection Agency (indicators on the size structure of predatory fish). For a number of indicators, quantitative parameters are specified that should be used to measure the indicator, making them potentially measurable. However, thresholds for the achievement of the indicator/target are not proposed. Baselines are not indicated either. 

Many indicators are very similar to the GES indicators. They are related to the fish community, either in coastal or in outer waters. In terms of the species covered by the targets/indicators, the indicators cover key/sensitive species in coastal and offshore waters (specified perch in the Baltic Sea for indicator 1.3E), important functional groups of fish in coastal and offshore waters (specified carp in the Baltic Sea for indicator 1.6E), predatory fish in coastal and offshore waters (unspecified), large individual in offshore waters (unspecified). Apart from the specific mention of two species in the Baltic, the rest of the indicators are relatively unspecific with regard to the species/functional groups covered. 

All indicators are state indicators but in a way, many of them are related to the fishing pressure and other pressures and impacts from human activities (e.g. nutrient enrichment, hydrographical changes such as temperature and salinity). However, none of the indicators are directly geared towards reducing the pressure from a specific human activity. 

As for the GES definition, many indicators are still under development and will not be operational before 2014 (or even 2018 for some of them, which leaves very little time for the implementation of the target before the 2020 deadline for the achievement of GES). ";"From Descriptor 1, 4 assessment:

The set of targets and indicators defined by Sweden to cover D1 and D4 is considered inadequate. The targets/indicators defined are relatively specific and potentially measurable, and they cover most of the Commission Decision criteria and indicators for D1 and D4. However they only focus on the fish community, mammals and birds are not at all addressed.  ";"From Descriptor 1, 4 assessment:

- Targets and indicators are potentially measurable and specific
- They cover most of the Commission Decision criteria/indicators
- Only focused on fish, no targets for other species groups
- No pressure targets";1;Inadequate
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D4;Consistency ;;"The assessment of biological features is consistent with the definitions of GES for Descriptors 1 and 4 since it covers the same habitat types and species groups as those targeted by the GES definitions. However the set of targets and indicators is not consistent with the initial assessment since it does not cover birds and mammals despite the fact that the status of these species groups has been assessed as not good in the initial assessment.  

For Descriptor 6, the targets/indicators defined do not make use of the indicator BQI used in the GES definition. Both the targets and GES are defined at a very general level and lack any references to specific features. The targets and GES both show a low level of ambition. ";;;;
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels. The definition is applicable to both Swedish marine regions – the North Sea and the Baltic Sea – and uses MSFD definition of good trophic status, with all three criteria (nutrient levels, direct and indirect impacts) defined separately, using indicators which equate to 5.1.1, 5.2.1. 5.2.2, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 of the 2010 Commission Decision. Indicators 5.1B, 5.2B and 5.2D are only reported in the paper report.
 
In the accompanying text to the GES definitions at indicator level, extensive reference is made to the HELCOM EUTRO-PRO indicators for the development of the Swedish indicators but it is not clearly explained how they relate to the 2010 Commission Decision indicators.  It seems that no indicator relating to nutrient ratios (5.1.2) (although it may not be relevant for Swedish waters), abundance of opportunistic macroalgae (or more specifically reed growth on sandy beaches) (5.2.3) or changes in floristic composition (5.2.4) is used for measurement of GES, despite the fact that reference to toxic phytoplankton blooms, notably cyanobacteria, is made in the initial assessment. In addition to dissolved oxygen status of bottom waters, Sweden also uses the results of a benthic faunal index in determining whether or not GES has been achieved.

It is not entirely clear if the Water Framework Directive assessment methodologies and GES thresholds were used for MSFD assessment purposes but the document systematically referred to (NFS 2008:1) is the regulations and general advice related to the classification of and environmental quality standards for surface waters by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (including coastal water bodies assessment/ classification), which refers to the WFD. In terms of threshold values, Sweden provides, in the Annex 2 of its paper report, all relevant threshold values for the GES indicators it has defined for all relevant assessment areas. It also describes the indicators that it considers to be still under development but which could be relevant for the assessment of GES (e.g. development of indicators 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 unlikely to take place before 2018 on the basis of the WATERS research programme). ";The GES definition of Sweden for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. The definition of GES is criteria/indicator-based, including all criteria, and most (if not all) indicators, in addition to which the assessment methodology incorporates results from a benthic faunal index (the BQI, Benthic Quality Index), from which hypoxic events could be intimated over a much longer timescale than from occasional but regular dissolved oxygen monitoring. Indicators on abundance of opportunistic macroalgae and species shift in floristic composition are missing however. The definition refers to a methods manual, which was presumably developed for the WFD assessment purpose, so MSFD GES is presumably linked to the WFD GES. Since normative values have been provided for all GES indicators, the GES definition is sufficiently specific to determine when GES has been achieved.;"- GES definition covers all the criteria from the Commission Decision

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Sweden has carried out an initial assessment – qualitative and quantitative – on eutrophication for the North Sea. The assessment covers all relevant nutrients (Nitrogen and Phosphorus) and organic material in terms of loads, with considerable knowledge of sectoral loads. Agriculture, forestry and urban discharges are listed as the main causes of eutrophication, which according to the information reported affects between 50-75% of the Swedish North Sea. Nitrogen and Phosphorus concentrations in seawater are discussed, but organic status does appear to be covered by dissolved oxygen concentrations. Phytoplankton is considered in terms of chlorophyll concentrations only, but turbidity/water clarity is not considered in the assessment; neither are changes in floristic composition. The report indicates a decreasing trend for the levels of nutrient and organic matter enrichment in the North Sea.

Sweden has also listed the main features impacted by eutrophication. Impacts on the abundance of opportunistic macroalgae have been included in reference to increases in the abundances and effects of filamentous algae. Impacts of eutrophication on benthic communities have also been assessed. In relation to the impacts on water column, the report mentions the Swedish assessment of eutrophication in 2007 under OSPAR guidelines which classified Kattegat and Skagerrak coastal waters as areas of concern.";The initial assessment of Sweden for eutrophication in the North Sea is assessed as partially adequate.

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has defined one target and the associated indicators to address Descriptor 5 (in the reporting sheets one additional target one hazardous substances is reported but this appears to be a typo). The set of target and associated indicators applies both to the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. While the target and first two indicators apply to both regions as a whole, the last three indicators (based on the GES indicators 5.1B, 5.1C and 5.1D) have been defined for specific assessment areas in the two (sub)regions and apply only to offshore waters. The reason why specific GES definitions are proposed for specific assessment areas is because the threshold values (from NFS 2008:1 and HELCOM COMBINE) vary according to the area to which they apply.

The target is a re-wording of the overall D5 GES definition provided in Annex I of the MSFD. Assessment of progress can be defined in terms of measured/estimated loads reduction. The first two indicators are not measurable since no quantitative threshold values have been defined. In the paper report, Sweden provides additional information regarding the second associated indicator on nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff and point sources. It is the only target-associated indicator (of all descriptors) which is further specified in the paper report and it is not clear why this indicator particularly is further developed. Sweden described the method to be used to measure this indicator (HELCOM 2011 PLC-Water guidelines and OSPAR 1998 RID Principles) and specifies a GES boundary (assessment of GES will be based on normalized annual mean flow over the previous six years. The long term goal is that the supply should be less than the maximum load to be defined within the framework of international agreements). The first indicator is said to be still under development.

The last three indicators are the same as the GES indicators and specific threshold values have been defined according to the assessment area they cover (which are also the same as the GES boundaries). They are based on the HELCOM COMBINE programme for both regions. 

The indicators on chlorophyll-a concentrations and visibility in offshore waters are impact-related. Individual pressures/human activities resulting in organic/nutrient loads are not targeted, but total pressures are. The environmental target appears to be ambitious enough to achieve GES by 2020 in offshore waters but not in coastal waters, to which the last three indicators do not apply. ";The set of environmental target and associated indicators defined by Sweden for D5 is considered as partially adequate. It has defined a number of specific indicators with defined threshold values per assessment areas. These cover partly the indicators defined for GES but more specific indicators on macrophytobenthos, dissolved oxygen concentrations and BQI index results, with defined thresholds, would have strengthened the target. However, the last three indicators on levels and impacts apply only to offshore waters. Coastal waters are not covered by these targets/indicators but extensive reference to the WFD is made, which covers coastal waters.  ;"- Include a number of specific indicators with threshold values per assessment areas
- Not all indicators are measurable or applicable to coastal waters
- Ambitious enough at least for offshore waters";2;Partially adequate
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are consistent with Sweden’s definition of GES. In the North Sea, the pressures assessment is fully consistent with the definition of GES and the impact assessment considers nutrient concentrations and the phytoplankton community in terms of chlorophyll concentrations, as well as changes in the floristic community composition and to impacts on seabed communities. In the Baltic Sea, individual pressures and the total eutrophication pressures are described in detail and GES is well defined in terms of nutrient concentrations, direct and indirect impacts. Growth of opportunistic macroalgae is apparently not considered in the definition of GES, but is not considered as an impact. Occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms is considered as an impact, but it is not specified whether this is included in the definition of GES. In addition, impacts on macrophytobenthos communities appear to be described more in theoretical than actual (assessed) terms.

The set of targets and indicators are only partially consistent with the GES definition as it covers relevant indicators but a number of other indicators included in the GES definition are missing and the indicators defined apply only to offshore waters. Coastal waters do not seem to be covered by the last three (more specific) indicators, which means that it is not certain whether the target/indicators are sufficient to help achieve GES. ";;;;
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined the GES for Descriptor 6 at the level of the descriptor, criteria and indicators. It covers both criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision but only provides indicators to cover criterion 6.2. Indicator 6.2A is defined for coastal waters and indicator 6.2B is for offshore waters using the benthic index BQI which corresponds to indicator 6.2.2 of the 2010 Commission Decision. Except for indicator 6.2.2 none of the indicators from the 2010 Commission decision have been applied when defining GES. The Descriptor itself is a verbatim copy of the descriptor as provided in Annex I. 

Criterion 6.1 is a pressure-related criterion while 6.2 is a state-related criterion. Both criteria require that the benthic community are maintained at a general level, e.g. ecological functions, species diversity, presence of species, ecological structure are maintained. These conditions do not set any specific baselines or thresholds and could therefore allow both improvements as well as further degradation of the benthic community from the current situation. Indicators 6.2A and 6.2B do set specific thresholds for Descriptor 6 using the Benthic Quality Index for coastal and offshore waters but these indicators rely on invertebrate fauna and therefore may not include important benthic habitats and components. 

No specific substrate type and no specific benthic species are mentioned in the definition, which remains very general. 

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 1 at the level of the descriptor, the criteria and the indicators. It covers all criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision and most of the indicators. The indicators that are not addressed in the definition include 1.1.2 (distributional pattern), 1.1.3 (area covered by species), 1.3.2 (genetic structure), 1.4.1 (distributional range), 1.4.2 (distributional pattern), 1.5.2 (habitat volume), 1.6.3 (physical, hydrological and chemical conditions). It should be noted that a number of indicators have not been reported in the reporting sheets (for either region) and are only present in the paper reports (1.2D, 1.3E, 1.6A and 1.6B).

Habitats 
According to Sweden’s reporting in the reporting sheets, the GES definitions for habitats at criteria level cover all seabed and water column habitats. A few indicators are focused on specific habitats or habitat-forming communities (e.g. macro vegetation in coastal waters). Habitats considered are mostly coastal (shallow or shelf) and it seems that no specific indicator has been developed for water column habitats (zooplankton and phytoplankton are mentioned as part of the coastal pelagic habitats but no indicator on these have been developed yet). Intertidal habitats are not covered but would not be relevant anyway.  

Sweden mentions that the Commission has recommended the use of the EUNIS level 2 classification of habitats, which it has done while still adapting to Swedish circumstances. It does not use the predominant habitat types defined for the purpose of the MSFD. The habitat types covered by the GES criteria and indicators for habitats include: photic hard and sediment bottom (and the associated communities macro-vegetation and bottom fauna), aphotic hard and sediment bottom (and the associated community bottom fauna) and pelagic coastal and offshore waters (and the associated communities fish, zooplankton and phytoplankton). This classification seems to follow the HELCOM classification of habitats. It has been applied to both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (which is explained by the fact that HELCOM waters overlap with North Sea water on the Kattegat area). 

The GES definitions for Criteria 1.4 and 1.5 on habitat distribution and extent are much more limited than for other criteria. Sweden provides justification for the lack of indicators under criterion 1.4 in the gap analysis of its paper report. It mentions that distribution of benthic habitats is only very limitedly monitored. At the moment, statistical modelling is used to produce maps of habitats distribution which provide information about the probability of occurrence but no information on biomass of habitat-forming species. According to current research projects, 50% of Swedish coastal areas should be mapped by 2014 using modelling. 

Sweden also explains that most of the “biologically valuable marine habitats” in Swedish waters are covered by the Habitats Directive and that habitat distribution is part of the assessment of Favourable Conservation Status (FCV), the next reporting cycle of which will take place in 2013. Sweden does however mention that the Habitats Directive does not cover soft sediment in the aphotic zone, which is most widespread in Sweden and contains habitats listed as threatened under the OSPAR Convention (e.g. sea pens communities).

With regard to criterion 1.5 and 1.6 on habitat extent and condition, Sweden also explains that data is lacking to develop better indicators (e.g. indicator 1.5A only measures the proliferation of macro vegetation in depth, no monitoring of the benthic communities in hard bottoms, lack of phytoplankton-based indicators) and gives an indication of the development needs and plans to address these. 

Criterion 1.6 is still more developed than the other two. Specific indicators have been defined and quantitative threshold values have been specified for a few indicators (e.g. for indicator 1.6B based on OSPAR’s EcoQO and the requirements of the EU Data Collection Regulation (2010/93)). The use of the Bottom Fauna Indices (BQI) is also quite specific and based on the national transposition of the Water Framework Directive (NFS 2008). ";"The Swedish GES definition for descriptor 6 is considered partially adequate. The definition of GES covers both criteria of the Commission Decision and only one indicator. Except for the thresholds set for indicators 6.2A and 6.2B, which do not take into account the North Sea, the GES definition does not set specific baselines or thresholds and the definitions at criteria level use unspecific terms. The specific thresholds set using the BQI index might not include all relevant biogenic habitats and ecosystem components to measure adequately the achievement of GES in the relevant sea areas. The GES definition in general shows a relatively low level of ambition for Descriptor 6.

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate, 2):

The GES definition for Descriptor 1 by Sweden is considered partially adequate. Sweden has defined GES for all the criteria of the Commission Decision and many indicators. The GES definition covers the most relevant species groups and habitat types (although water column habitats are not well-covered yet). It refers to the Habitats Directive for the reporting on habitats, to the Water Framework Directive and uses a number of standards from HELCOM CORESET. It mentions the OSPAR EcoQOs only in one instance. The majority of indicators are not specific in terms of threshold or, more importantly for the types of indicators defined, baselines. Only a very limited number of indicators are already operational in 2012. The others are expected to be operational by 2014 or even 2018 (which is late to achieve GES by 2020). To date, it is not possible to fully assess when GES is considered to be achieved.";"- GES definition covers both criteria of the Commission Decision and only indicator 6.2.2

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

Sweden has carried out an initial assessment in relation to physical loss and physical damage for both the North Sea and in the Baltic Sea. Sweden acknowledges the need to collect more information on the activities causing smothering of the seabed and also mentions the need to improve data concerning coastal waters. Sweden states that work is underway within ICES to improve the collection and analysis of data on bottom trawling and similar activities and their impact on the relevant habitats.

The main causes of physical loss are listed and briefly described: renewable energy structures, solid waste disposal and dredging. Although no quantification is made, maps are provided on e.g. existing and planned wind turbines or ports with an area over 2,500 square meters. The main features affected by physical loss are also listed. It is reported that the current level of pressure is stable but no conclusive judgements on the level of pressure or its impacts have been reported (albeit it is indicated that the level of the pressure may be significant, particularly in coastal waters). 

In relation to physical damage, Sweden had listed the main causes of pressure as being fisheries, shipping and tourism, indicating in addition that bottom trawling is the main cause of abrasion. Bottom trawling is said to be more intense in the North Sea than in the Baltic Sea, both in terms of intensity and extent, and map showing the area where this activity occurs is provided. Sediment habitats and demersal fish are indicated as the main features impacted by physical damage but some individual species (herring, sprat and cod) are expressly referred to. No trends or conclusive judgements on the level of pressure or its impacts have been provided, however, it is indicated that abrasion by trawling probably causes damage to various seabed habitats. Reference is made to assessments by both OSPAR and HELCOM.

Habitats
Sweden has carried out an initial assessment on the habitats in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The assessment is mainly qualitative but some parameters are quantified. Literature is often cited and OSPAR and HELCOM documents and projects are mentioned throughout the report. Notwithstanding, Sweden acknowledges a series of information gaps related to insufficient monitoring on e.g. some species of macrofauna or land-based spread of angiosperms, and indicates the need to developed appropriate methods and indicators to improve knowledge.

The information reported by Sweden is more developed in the paper report than in the reporting sheets. In the paper report Sweden describes its predominant habitats, which include seabed habitats and water column habitats, special habitats listed under the Habitats Directive, OSPAR and HELCOM, and other habitats. In the reporting sheets, for the North Sea, Sweden reports on water column habitats all, seabed fauna habitats, macroalgae habitats, angiosperms habitats, and OSPAR Convention Annex I habitats. For the Baltic Sea, Sweden reports on water column habitats all and Helsinki Convention Annex I habitats; in addition it also reports on macroalgae habitats, angiosperms habitats and seabed fauna habitats, separately, for the Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Bothnia.

For most habitats the assessment includes descriptions of habitat distribution, extent and condition, as well as the main pressure affecting the habitats. Trends are provided as are judgements on the current status, although only in a few cases in reference to GES. Thus, e.g. the status of both phytoplankton and zooplankton (reported under water column habitats) in the Baltic is considered “not acceptable”; for the North Sea, there is not such a specific conclusive judgement on phytoplankton and zooplankton but it is indicated that 14% of the coastal water bodies had a status “less than good” in 2012. For some habitat types, some parameters are quantified and the status in relation to natural conditions is provided.";"From Descriptor 1 , 4, 6 assessment:

In addition, there are no conclusive judgements on the current status even if there is information on the plans to gather data that will allow making these judgements in the future.

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has defined two general targets for Descriptor 6. Target D.1 seems to relate to the quality of habitats not affected by human activities while target D.2 is target dealing with the extent of biogenic substrate. 

The indicators defined for target D.1 are specific with regard to the human activities addressed by the target. They are potentially measurable but no threshold values have been set which means that they are not SMART. In addition, they only deal with the area of the seafloor that is affected by various human activities and will therefore not measure how well areas unaffected by human activities provide conditions for maintaining the structure and function of sea beds as the target requires. Also, the fact that the target refers to “sea beds” instead of “seabed habitats” creates some uncertainty as to what conditions and functions need to be maintained. 

Target D.2 only has one indicator and both the target and indicator deal with biogenic substrate as a whole and make no differentiation between different types of biogenic substrates. The implied baseline for target D.2 is the current area of biogenic substrate, however this is not equivalent to the current seabed conditions as there can still be shifts in the types of biogenic substrates while the area remains the same or increases. Also the indicators provided for target D.1 seem more relevant for target D.2. ";The Swedish targets for descriptor 6 are considered partially adequate. The targets are unspecific in certain aspects as they do not refer to specific habitats or seabed components. The indicators for target D.1 are not suitable to measure the achievement of the target because of the lack of threshold values. However they are specific in the human activities addressed by the target. The two targets for D6 on their own as well as together are weak and are likely to be insufficient for achieving GES.;"- Relatively unspecific (no reference to specific substrate types/species)

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels.

In addition, the concepts of “permanent”, “large scale”, “changes” or “alteration” are not developed at all.

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor, criteria and indicator levels in the paper report and the reporting sheets (covering concentration and effects of contaminants). The GES definition is nearly the same for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The definition at descriptor level is a copy of the definition for Descriptor 8 in Annex I of the Directive but it is then further specified at criteria and indicator levels.

The links between Descriptor 8 and Descriptors 1 and 4 are mentioned in the paper report. A number of indicators for the GES definition of D8 are also used for D1 and D4 (indicators 8.2B and 8.2C).

Concentration of contaminants
Sweden covers the criterion on concentration of contaminants through a general statement, which refers to the three relevant matrices (water, sediment and biota), and three more specific indicators. 

The two first indicators, which are more restricted as they only cover one substance each measured in fish, are defined according to an absolute threshold that should not be exceeded. The third indicator, which covers more substances in different matrices (fish, mussels and guillemot eggs) is trend-based (no significant increasing trend over 6 years). 

The two first indicators (8.1A and 8.1B) relate to the concentrations of mercury (Hg) and HCB in fish. The threshold values, corresponding to the EU EQS (from Directive 2008/105/EC) for these substances, are reproduced in the reporting sheets (0.02 mg / kg wet weight for mercury and 0.01 mg / kg wet weight for HCB). Sweden justifies the selection of these two substances by stating that mercury is mandatory for monitoring by OSPAR and HELCOM CORESET and mercury and HCB are both priority substances under Directive 2008/105/EC. Both substances are already monitored for fish, mussels, guillemot eggs and sediment within the national marine monitoring program. Because fish is high up in the food web, hazardous substances in fish pose risks both to other individuals in the marine ecosystem (mammals, birds) and to humans through the consumption of fish. Therefore, according to Sweden fish is an appropriate matrix for the measurement of concentrations of these two dangerous substances and the assessment of risks of adverse effects. 

Despite the reference to the use of sediment and waters as matrices for the measurement of concentrations in the definition of criterion 8.1, no mention is made of these in the specific indicators. Sweden mentions that it is using the most appropriate matrices for the monitoring of hazardous substances which pose a risk to the marine environment, biota and sediment. However, it mentions that no agreed levels have been defined for sediment at EU and national level. This therefore seems to exclude the use of the EQS in marine waters for this matrix. It also means that Sweden does not use the OSPAR’s and HELCOM’s environmental assessment criteria for measurements in biota other than fish and in sediment. Because Sweden is not using the OSPAR/HELCOM EAC in their GES definition and does not refer to the EQS in water, it is understandable that it has set absolute thresholds for only two substances, Hg and HCB, as these are two of the only three substances for which an EQS has been set in biota. It is not certain why Sweden has not set a similar indicator for the third substance, HCBD.

The third indicator (8.1C) is further specified in the reporting sheet and the paper report as a list of the relevant substances to be measured per matrix is provided (Fish: Hg, Cd, Pb, HCB, HBCD, brominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds, HCH, non-dioxin-like PCBs and dioxins, dibenzofurans and dioxin-like PCBs; Mussels: Hg, Cd, Pb and PAH; Guillemot eggs: Hg, Cd, Pb, HCB, dioxins , dibenzofurans, dioxin-like PCBs, non-dioxin-like PCBs, HBCD, brominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds and HCH). Since indicator 8.1C is trend-based and a timescale is specified (over the past 6 years), there is no need for threshold values and it is understood that the baseline is the concentration levels for these substances in 2012 to achieve GES in 2020. It is not clear what the term “significant increasing trend” means and whether a limited increase is acceptable. 

In the paper report, Sweden provides a description of the development needed for a number of parameters/substances (e.g. limit values needed for measurements in sediment, a number of substances can only be measured in water and not in biota). However, it does not specify further what is meant by “no significant increase”. 

Effects of contaminants
For effects of contaminants, Sweden has defined one general statement referring to “unacceptable biological effects at the individual, population, community, or ecosystem level” and four specific indicators: two only for the Baltic Sea and two for both marine regions. For the North Sea, only the seals are used as indicator for GES, whereas for the Baltic, the white-tailed eagle, the seal and the guillemot are used. Indicators for biological effects in the Baltic Sea include shell thickness of white-tailed eagle and guillemot eggs and productivity of white-tailed eagle populations. It is not clear why the indicator of shell thickness of guillemot eggs (8.2A) is not used also in the North Sea.  It should be noted that indicators 8.2A on shell thickness and 8.2D on oil discharges have not been reported in the reporting sheets. 

The indicators defined by Sweden for biological effects are closely related to various OSPAR’s EcoQOs, e.g. about the productivity of seals or eggshell thinning, but are not exactly the same as the EcoQOs and no reference is made to OSPAR, HELCOM or ICES. 

In the Baltic Sea reporting sheet, Sweden has reported the threshold values to be used for indicator 8.2B and indicator 8.2C (see analysis of these under Descriptor 1 – indicators 1.3B, C and D). No threshold value or baseline is defined for indicator 8.2A in the reporting sheet but it is defined in the paper report. It is also stated that it will be operational only in 2014. No explanation or justification is provided as to why certain indicators are not operational yet. 

As for criterion 8.1, Sweden mentions a number of parameters/effects that need further development before they can be used as GES indicators for criterion 8.2 (e.g. imposex effects of TBT on gastropods, health status of fish).  It is not clear however if (and when) and by whom these will be further developed. 

Acute pollution events are covered by indicator 8.2D, which relates to the number of detected discharges. No indicator is defined for the extent of the discharges and the effect of oil and oil-related products on biota. The OPSAR EcoQO on oiled guillemots is not used by Sweden. However, the goal of achieving zero discharges a year would de facto eliminate effects on biota. No threshold or baseline is provided for this indicator in the reporting sheet but they are in the paper report. GES is achieved when the number of detected illegal discharges per flight hour is permanently reduced and the assessment is based on the previous six-year period. This would mean therefore that the zero goal should be achieved by 2020, which is not clear from the GES definition itself. ";The GES definition for D8 for both marine regions is considered partially adequate. Sweden uses the EU EQS as reference values for concentrations of contaminants in biota however it does not mention compliance to the EQS in water and therefore does not provide details of how (and if) the EQS will be applied to this matrix. Considering that it uses only the EQS in biota as reference values (and not OSPAR or HELCOM’s EAC), it is logical that it has defined indicators with absolute threshold values only for two substances (although it is not clear why such indicator was not also defined for HCBD) and set a third trend-based indicator. But Sweden is not clear as to what it means with “no significant increase”. There is no issue of complementarity with the RSC standards as these are not used. In terms of effects of contaminants, despite the general phrasing of criterion 8.2 (unacceptable biological effects at the individual, population, community, or ecosystem level), the indicators are limited to one specific parameter for only three (for the Baltic) or even just one (for the North Sea) species. No direct reference is made to OSPAR, HELCOM or ICES for criteria for biological effects but the indicators used are actually quite close to a number of EcoQOs. Only a limited number of indicators are operational in 2012 and apply to both regions. The EcoQO on oiled guillemot is not used for acute pollution event, only the number of discharges is covered by the Swedish indicator. In addition, the GES definition for indicator B.2D is rather phrased like a target helping the achievement of a GES, which would be better defined as zero illegal discharges by 2020.;"- GES defined for both criteria of the Commission Decision and all indicators (including acute pollution events)
- Reference to EQS but only in biota, no reference to EQS in water (uncertainty whether all priority substances are covered)
- Thresholds defined only for two substances
- Effects of contaminants only for one species
- Similarities to OSPAR EcoQOs but no direct reference";2;Partially adequate
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Sweden reports for the Baltic Sea and the North Sea together in the paper report and reports the same information for both regions in the reporting sheet.  The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
The description by Sweden of contamination by synthetic and non-synthetic substances is mostly qualitative (including qualitative trends). It is based on national reports (2008 Environmental Protection Agency report) and OSPAR and HELCOM’s most recent reports describing the effects of hazardous substances in the marine environment (i.e. OSPAR 2010 QSR; not specified for HELCOM). Sweden acknowledges that OSPAR and HELCOM have used slightly different criteria and assessment than those who may in the future be used by the implementation of the MSFD but the information is still very valuable to make an initial assessment of the state of the Swedish marine environment in relation to dangerous substances. 

Sweden does not describe the sources of contamination by man-made substance nor does it provide a quantitative assessment of input loads from these substances into the environment. It justifies this because of the data gaps but does not provide a description of what it will do to address these gaps. However it provides a number of qualitative trends for a number of substances measured in various matrices. The man-made substances assessed include HCB, dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, HCH, PBDE, TBT, alkylphenols, PAH, DDT, DEHP and others less important for the Swedish marine environment (PCB, HBCDD, PFOS). 

The heavy metals assessed include mercury, nickel, cadmium and lead. For heavy metals, Sweden also provides a qualitative description of diffuse and point sources of contamination (diffuse pollution from leakage from forestry and logging for cadmium, mercury, copper, nickel and lead, land and stormwater for mercury, agriculture for nickel; point sources are mostly industries and wastewater treatment plans) In addition, Sweden acknowledges that there are considerable data gaps concerning emissions from land deposits, antifouling agents, paints and coatings and resuspension from sediments. Despite this, it provides a quantitative assessment of inputs from these various metals in the environment (i.e. in tonnes / year Cd: 3.184 Cu: 128.026 Ni: 75.058 Pb: 63.672 Zn: 702.495 Hg: 0.61). 

For each substance assessed, Sweden provides a qualitative description of how it is monitored and measured and against which levels it is assessed (e.g. EQS, OSPAR EAC, Regulation 1259/2011 on foodstuffs, etc.) Sweden also provides a description of the levels of contaminants in marine organisms (in particular fish, mussels, herring and guillemot eggs). 

In terms of impacts on seabed habitats, Sweden only describes the decreasing trends in the levels of DEHP and TBT in sediment in both marine regions. Impacts on functional groups are better described, based on a 2008 report from the Environmental Protection Agency. The biological effects qualitatively described include imposex in dog whelks, fish health status, EROD, ulcers in seals and blubber thickness and eagles’ eggs shell thickness (which is the only one for which quantitative trends are provided). 

In terms of judgement, Sweden simply refers for both marine regions to the conclusion from the OSPAR 2010 QSR report that there are major problems with hazardous substances, despite decreasing concentration (e.g. of PAHs, PCBs and metals (Hg, Pb, Cd)). It also refers to HELCOM’s assessments of a number of substances (e.g. PCBs, DDT/DDE, cadmium, lead and TBT) concluding that their levels are problematic in more or less all monitoring stations. As mentioned before, the standards used to make these judgements are either the EU EQS or OSPAR’s EAC. No specific judgement is made for the impacts on ecosystem components. Sweden does not make an aggregated judgement at the level of the marine (sub)region on the current level of and impact from contamination from hazardous substances. 

In terms of data and knowledge gaps, Sweden acknowledges that it has not developed any criteria to assess the effects of hazardous substances on ecosystem components, which could be used as GES boundaries/thresholds. It also mentions the limited number of sites monitored and that, depending on the parameter monitored, it is either mainly in the offshore waters (e.g. substances in sediment) or mainly coastal (e.g. imposex). However, in the paper report Sweden proposes a number of parameters that should be monitored in order to define better indicators for the definition of GES for Descriptor 8. These include HCB in biota (fish, blue mussels, guillemot eggs) and sediment, dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in biota (fish, guillemot eggs), non-dioxin-like PCBs in biota, HBCDD in biota, PBDE in biota and sediment, PFOs in fish liver, HCH in biota and sediment, PAH in blue mussel and sediment, organotin compounds in dog whelk and sediment, alkylphenols in sediment, drug residues, DDT, and a number of additional substances. Sweden explains that the selection of these parameters is based on an assessment of the risks to the environment according to available data, and based on the HELCOM CORESET and OSPAR CEMP procedures, and whether they are already included in the current monitoring programme. 

Radionuclides
The description of contamination by radionuclides has been mixed with the description of contamination by hazardous substances in the paper report. The description is rather limited, looking only at the concentrations of Cesium-137 in water, mussels and fish. Inputs of radionuclides come mostly from nuclear facilities. Concentrations are decreasing and considered to be low (usually between .02 to 0.06 Bq / l), although not as low as pre-Chernobyl values. Sweden does not make a conclusive judgement on the current levels of contamination, justifying that no indicators of GES have been developed yet for Swedish marine waters. In terms of impacts on ecosystem components, Sweden refers to the conclusion in the OSPAR QSR that impacts on organisms is unlikely, looking at impacts on seaweed, crabs and flatfish and using the screening value of 10 micro gray per hour developed within the EU projects ERICA and PROTECT. 

Acute pollution events
The description of contamination by acute pollution events is very limited despite Sweden acknowledging that it is a major problem for birds. In the paper report, a figure (from HELCOM) is included that shows the geographical localisation of acute pollution events in the HELCOM waters. In addition, Sweden mentions that according to coastguard registries, emissions peaked in the mid-90s and that the trend is decreasing. No assessment of impacts on ecosystem components is made (apart from a simple statement that it is a major problem for birds without further references) and no judgement on the current levels of contamination from acute pollution events.";The initial assessment of contamination of the Swedish marine waters by dangerous substances is considered partially adequate. The assessment is not complete in that it is mostly qualitative and does not describe in details the sources of contamination. Qualitative trends are provided for a number of substances measured in various matrices. An aggregated judgement in relation to GES is not clearly made but Sweden makes a number of specific judgements by substance or group of substances referring to EU or RSC standards (EQS, EAC or European research projects). The assessment of contamination by acute pollution is very limited. Sweden provides an account of the data and knowledge gaps and acknowledges that additional GES criteria and indicators need to be developed. ;"- Lack of details in the description of sources of contamination

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has defined two environmental targets and four associated indicators for both regions and one additional indicator specifically for the Baltic Sea. 

The two targets defined by Sweden correspond to the criteria for D8 of the Commission Decision (concentrations and effects of contaminants). The first target requires that concentrations of contaminants should not exceed the EQS values. While it is not specified which hazardous substances are covered by the target, the indicators mention metals (and Cd, Pb and Hg in reference to atmospheric depositions) and organic substances (dioxins and furans specified with regard to atmospheric depositions). For land-based sources however, the exact substances are not confirmed.  

From the text of the indicators, it seems that the EQS referred to include those measured in water (e.g. estimate trends in metal levels in the sea, total deposition in each sea basin). In addition, if the target is read literally, it also includes measuring the three substances for which an EQS has been established for measurement in biota (Hg, HCB and HCDB) and therefore it covers the GES definition. 

The three indicators focus on various sources of contamination, inland waters (rivers), coastal point sources and atmospheric deposition. However they are not measurable as they do not include specific threshold values and baselines. The text of the indicator merely explains the purpose of the indicator and in some cases the gaps (i.e. improvement of calculations to estimate total deposition in each country’s administrative sector; deficient monitoring of organic substances in offshore water and of emissions from point sources). 

In the accompanying text, Sweden specifies what it considers point emissions (direct emissions from such industries, sewage and accidents from maritime traffic or extraction platforms) and what it considers diffuse emissions (originating from agriculture, forestry and maritime traffic through continued leakage of hazardous substances). It explains that diffuse pollution is much more difficult to measure and control. It considers that Targets B.1 and B.2 cover both the concentration of contaminants and the input and effects of contaminants. The indicators for Target B.1 clearly address input of hazardous substances into the marine environment but since they are not measurable, it cannot be considered that they control inputs of hazardous substances. Sweden specifies that these three indicators will be operational only in 2018.

With regard to the effects of contaminants, the indicator defined for both regions is identical to the GES definition for indicator 8.2.2 of the Commission Decision. Its achievement should therefore ensure that GES is achieved but it is rather an expression of GES than a target defined to help achieve GES (e.g. by focusing on a pressure). The same applies for indicator 8.2A, which applies only to the Baltic region (consistently with the GES definition). For both indicators, a threshold value and a baseline is specified. The threshold for indicator 8.2D is the same as the GES threshold but a baseline is specified, which is not in the GES definition but makes it slightly more measurable (decreasing trend based on 6 previous years, i.e. from 2012). For indicator 8.2A, both threshold values and baselines have been reported, which was not the case in the GES definition. Following the logic from Sweden, it can be assumed that these are the same as the GES threshold and baseline. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by Sweden to cover D8, for both marine regions, is considered partially adequate. It requires compliance with the EQS Directive, which would ensure achievement of GES. It is not fully consistent with the GES definition since the GES definition requires compliance with the EQS only in biota (for only two substances) but it is not contradictory. Target B2.1 refers to input of hazardous substances from various sources through its three indicators but does not go as far as defining thresholds and baselines to control these input, which would make this target operational and helpful towards achieving GES. Making these indicators operational only in 2018 gives them very limited time to help achieve GES by 2020. Target B2.2 refers to effects of contaminants, but the indicators associated are the copy of the GES indicators and are therefore not considered appropriate target indicators, defined to help achieve GES. ;"- The first target is SMART as it directly refers to the EQS
- Several indicators on sources of contamination but lack of threshold value
- Target on effects of contaminants is equivalent to GES definition but thresholds are defined at indicator level (only one relevant for the North Sea)";2;Partially adequate
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D8;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the level of and impacts from contamination by hazardous substances is relatively consistent with the definition of GES (looking at the same substances and referring to Directive 2008/105/EC). However Sweden also refers regularly to the OSPAR environmental assessment criteria (EAC) as standards for concentration levels, which it does not use in its GES definition. Similarly it assesses a number of biological effects that are not included as indicators of GES (e.g. imposex, EROD, fish health status, blubber thickness) but Sweden had acknowledged in its GES section that these indicators needed further development before being used as GES indicators. Finally, it acknowledges in its initial assessment that concentration levels of TBT in sediment are so high that GES would not be achieved if this was included as an indicator of GES. Since TBT is in fact not included in the Swedish GES definition for D8, it seems to support the idea that only indicators which are susceptible to fall under acceptable levels by 2020 should be included as GES indicators.  

The targets and associated indicators are not fully consistent with the GES definition. As mentioned before, they seem to cover compliance with the EQSD in marine waters whereas the GES definition is restricted to biota. This is not in contradiction however and compliance with the EQSD should ensure achievement of GES. Although it is not clear how the EQSD is to be applied to offshore waters. The definition of target indicators to control various sources of pollution would also help achieve GES but the indicators are not specific enough in terms of what and how much they control. 

The indicators set for the environmental targets do not cover all parameters of the GES definition, in particular for the effects of contaminants (GES indicators 8.2B and 8.2C are not covered by the targets under D8). However, considering the links between these indicators and the biodiversity indicators, it is possible that they are covered by the biodiversity targets. ";;;;
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"
Sweden has defined GES for Descriptor 9 at descriptor, criterion and indicator levels for both marine regions. The definition at descriptor level is a mere copy of the text of Annex I of the MSFD but it is further specified through the criterion, referring to levels, numbers and frequency of hazardous substances, and the indicator, referring to concentrations of substances. 

The substances covered by the GES definition and the threshold values that should not be exceeded are those of Regulation 1881/2006. While the GES definition is not specific with regard to the fish and other seafood that should be monitored (except to specify that it concerns fish caught in the wild), the threshold values defined provide a sufficient level of detail in this regard. The GES refer to the maximum allowable concentrations (per wet weight) of a number of edible species (e.g. Pb and Cd in the blue mussel or dioxins in the North Sea/Baltic herring). The species covered include the blue mussel, herring, cod, bass, North Sea and Baltic herring, sprat, salmon, trout and perch. In addition, Sweden refers to the amendments to Regulation 1881/2006 through Regulation 1259/2011 (no reference is made to Regulation 835/2011). 

Despite the inclusion of the parameter of frequency under criterion 9.1, no indicator or threshold is defined which relates to the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded (as expressed in the Commission Decision indicator 9.1.2). Sweden justifies that since there are no established thresholds at the EU/regional level, it is not clear which standards should be applied for GES to be achieved in this regard. ";The definition of GES for D9 for both regions is considered partially adequate. Sweden refers to the relevant standards (Regulation 1881/2006) and provides specific details of the substances and fish and seafood covered by the GES definition. However, it does not specify what is meant with “frequency of hazardous substances” in criterion 9.1. It does not seem to correspond to indicator 9.1.2 of the 2010 Commission Decision, which means that criterion 9.1 of the 2010 Commission Decision is not fully covered by the Swedish GES definition.;"- GES definition covers criterion 9.1 only partially as it does not refer to the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeeded

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Sweden reports for the Baltic Sea and the North Sea together in the paper report and reports the same information for both regions in the reporting sheet.  The assessment has therefore been grouped for the two regions. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
The description of contamination of fish and seafood by hazardous substances is relatively limited and mixed with the description of contamination of the environment by hazardous substances in the paper report (see D8). It mentions briefly that the HCB levels measured in herring muscle are just below the limit specified in the EQS Directive (0.01 mg / kg wet weight) and therefore that status is good. It describes more extensively contamination by mercury, with reference to the limit values set in Regulation 1881/2006, stating that the maximum allowed concentrations have never been exceeded in the fish investigated at national level within the marine program. Despite issues with mercury in children’s food (close to average levels), Sweden considers that the current levels are acceptable as per D9 (but not according to D8 indicators). Other substances measured include cadmium and lead in fish muscle and in mussels. Cadmium in fish muscle is considered to pose no risk for human consumption and since allowed limit values in mussels for human consumption are significantly higher than the EQS, cadmium and lead levels are not expected to be exceeded. 

In addition, in the paper report, Sweden also mentions that levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are exceeded for certain species (not specified) in certain areas (not specified) according to the limit values of Regulation 1259/2011 (amendment to Regulation 1881/2006) concluding that the current levels for these substances are not acceptable as per D9 (status is not good). 

Sweden notes the discrepancy between the conclusions regarding the acceptability of levels of contaminants in the environment and levels for human consumption and also mentions the issue of cumulative effects from contamination from other sources (e.g. nutrients, marine litter). 

Radionuclides
No assessment has been made of contamination of fish and seafood by radionuclides. 

Microbial pathogens
Sweden has made an assessment for the level of pressure and impacts related to microbial pathogens, only for bathing waters in Swedish waters. There are no separate assessments for the two sub-regions. The assessment for shellfish waters only states that sometimes shellfish harvesting is not allowed due to microbial pathogen contaminations. ";The initial assessment of contamination of fish and seafood for human consumption (including by microbial pathogens) by Sweden is considered partially adequate. Only a few substances are covered and only two (mercury and dioxins) are assessed against the relevant reference levels (Regulation 1881/2006 and amendment). Sweden does not discuss the issue of the origin of samples monitored. The assessment does not cover all relevant substances or all relevant fish/seafood. ;"- Limited assessment of only two substances (mercury and dioxins)

Sweden (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"Sweden has not defined specific targets to cover D9 however it explains that the targets covering D8 are also relevant for D9. 

The target for D8 requires compliance with the EQS Directive, which covers biota (fish) only for three substances (Hg, HCB and HCBD, but where Sweden has only chose to assess two of these). This means that all the other substances mentioned under the GES definition for D9 are not covered by the target on compliance with the EQS Directive. However, the indicators on the sources of pollution are relevant for D9 (since the ingestion of hazardous substances by marine organisms is caused by the same input of contaminants as what pollutes the marine waters in general). ";The set of targets and indicators defined by Sweden to cover pollution by contaminants is considered inadequate to cover D9. While the use of the EQS should ensure a lower level of contaminants in biota than Regulation 1881/2006 (because environmental monitoring is stricter than health monitoring), these have been defined only for three substances (Hg, HCB and HCDB). For a number of substances (e.g. dioxins, PCBs, PAHs, Cd, Pb), EQS in biota have not yet been approved but foodstuff limits exist in Regulation 1881/2006 which could have been used by Sweden. In addition, while the indicators on sources of pollution are also relevant for D9, their lack of specificity means that they are not operational and useful yet. It is therefore not clear how these targets and associated indicators will help achieve GES for D9. ;"- Same targets as for D8
- Coverage only of two substances in biota, lack of coverage of a number of substances
- No reference to EU foodstuffs regulations";1;Inadequate
Sweden (North East Atlantic);D9;Consistency ;;"The initial assessment of contamination by dangerous substances of fish and seafood for human consumption is limited to the assessment of only two substances (or group of) in fish (or species not specified in the assessment). This is not consistent with the GES definition, which provides a list of the reference levels that should not be exceeded for a number of substances in a number of different species of fish and shellfish. 

There is also a clear inconsistency between the targets, which are defined specifically towards D8 and refer only to Directive 2008/105/EC in terms of reference levels, and the GES definition which is very specific to D9 and refers to the relevant standards (Regulation 1881/2006). ";;;;
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has defined the good environmental status for Descriptor 1 at descriptor level, incorporating aspects of some criteria. Species distribution, population size and conditions (criteria 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3) and habitat distribution, extent and condition (criteria 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6) are covered in combination with direct reference to the specific targets. The objective to avoid significant impacts by human activities on the marine ecosystems and their constituent species and habitats is directly related to criterion 1.7. In addition, the GES definition also covers habitats and species identified as requiring protection under existing national or international agreements, which encompass the special/listed habitats and species (of Habitats and Birds Directives and relevant international agreements). The GES definition for D1 applies to both UK marine subregions – the Celtic Seas and the Greater North Sea. 

The GES definition applies to the whole ecosystem structure (‘marine ecosystems and their constituent species and habitats’). It does not specify which marine biodiversity components are addressed but in combination with the initial assessment and the environmental targets (which are directly referred to in the GES definition ), it is clear that the main biodiversity components and the main zones for water column and seabed habitats are covered. Therefore, all species, functional groups and habitat types are considered under the single statement of GES definition. Those already identified as requiring protection are additionally protected under existing mechanisms.

The definition of GES specifies that there should be no further deterioration in biodiversity, stating that the loss of biodiversity should be halted, and is even calling for an improvement: ‘where practicable, restoration is underway’; however use of 'is underway' means it is not a final state and that, as such, GES has not been clearly defined. It recognises that there is natural/climatic variation and ecosystem dynamics as the objectives above apply ‘in line with prevailing conditions’. In the paper report, a footnote to the GES definition specifies that prevailing conditions are defined as “in accordance with the intrinsic physiographic and climatic conditions of the different geographic regions. Prevailing conditions are understood to include climatic changes caused by human induced climate change. Prevailing conditions (including climatic changes) will need to be monitored in order for a full assessment of progress towards GES to be carried out and targets will need to be revised if prevailing conditions change in such a way as to make them no longer relevant or achievable.”  

The definition of GES does not directly refer to the definitions for Favourable Conservation Status under the Habitats Directive and for Good Ecological Status under the Water Framework Directive. However, the mention of ‘habitats and species requiring protection under existing legislation and the requirement that they will be conserved effectively through appropriate mechanisms’, is understood to include the Habitats and Birds Directives and the Water Framework Directive. In addition, both the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive are mentioned in the targets, which the UK has set in close connection to their GES definition, and in the explanatory text on the setting of the biodiversity targets in the paper report. 

Reference to past or “desired” states as baselines are not directly mentioned in the GES definition and the definition refers to “prevailing environmental conditions as defined by specific targets for species and habitats”. In the separate document listing all the final targets submitted by the UK to the Commission on 30 April 2013, baselines are provided for most targets. Many baselines are based on complete time series of data (best available). Favourable Reference Areas are also used as baselines for Habitats Directive habitats, which should be seen as ‘reference conditions’. Two exceptions should be noted: for pelagic, the baselines are only defined as “set in the past (but not as a reference to pristine conditions)” and for rock and reef and sediment habitats it is acknowledged that different baselines are needed for specific habitats and as such none are given.

For criteria 1.1 to 1.6, the definition of GES is generally based on the reference condition (‘prevailing environmental conditions’). For criterion 1 7, it is based on the general principle of reference condition (‘specific structures and functions necessary for their long-term maintenance exist for the foreseeable future’) plus acceptable deviation (‘not significantly impacted’).
";The definition of GES for D1 is considered partially adequate. There is an adequate coverage of the criteria. The GES definition addresses all biodiversity components. Whilst the formulation of GES remains purely qualitative, without baseline or threshold values, and is sometimes vague in its formulations ('not significantly impacted'), there is a specific link with the environmental targets to which the GES definition refers directly where more quantitative threshold values are given. The GES definition also indirectly refers to the Habitats and Birds Directives and the WFD through the targets. However, neither the GES nor the targets directly refer to OSPAR’s EcoQOs (although the use of the Large Fish indicator is in line with one of OSPAR EcoQOs and in the accompanying text to the targets the UK does mention the existence of the EcoQOs for a number of indicators, e.g. on the pup production of seals). Without the targets the GES definition is too unspecific to determine when GES is achieved. Linking the GES definition directly with the targets is not in agreement with guidance from the Commission. ;"- GES definition covers all Commission Decision criteria 
- General and qualitative description although the GES definition is directly linked to the environmental targets

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
The UK has used a mixed approach to report on species and functional groups. In the reporting sheets, it reports only on species group/functional group level. It reports on turtles, seals and demersal fish as part of the pre-defined list and reports on cetaceans, seabirds and waterbirds as an alternate grouping of the remaining functional groups. This applies to both subregions. It has defined smaller-scale assessment areas for which it reports on the same groups. The information reported in the paper report is relatively consistent with that presented in the reporting sheet except that the UK reports on fish communities in general and includes some (limited) information on pelagic fish (while acknowledging the lack of specific assessment of status of this group in Charting Progress 2 considering that an assessment of stocks is made by ICES). It also includes information on the status of deep-water fish and diadromous fish, whose status is recognized by the UK as particularly worrying. 

Cephalopods are not at all covered in the initial assessment. No justification is provided for this gap. Reference is made to various national, EU and international agreements for the protection of species throughout the assessment, and in particular in reference to the assessment of fish communities (e.g. Habitats Directive, CITES, Bonn Convention, OSPAR). However, the UK does not report on individual listed species under these agreements.

For each group, the group condition and relative abundance are described. The descriptions include some quantification and quantitative trends. The main pressures and impacts have been identified for fish (in general), demersal fish, cetaceans, seals and turtles (reptiles) and birds. The UK also provides comprehensive information on data gaps and plans to address these for each group assessed. 

A qualitative judgement (no, few or some problems) has been made on the overall status of the groups (demersal fish, cetaceans, seals, seabirds and water birds (partly)).  The status trend is given for all groups except reptiles. The UK provides some background information on how it has made its assessment of status (threshold values and baselines used), in particular for cetaceans, the UK mentions relying heavily on the Habitats Directive (FCS) and OSPAR 2010 QSR assessments.

Habitats
The UK has reported on a number of seabed habitat types (littoral sediment, intertidal rock, subtidal rock, shallow subtidal sediments, shelf subtidal sediments and deep-sea habitats), following the EUNIS level 2 categories rather than the pre-defined list of predominant habitat types (except for littoral sediment and littoral (intertidal) rock). However, the UK classification can be considered broadly equivalent to the MSFD classification, but with several types more aggregated by the UK. No fine-level habitats have been reported. The same habitat types are reported for the Celtic Seas and the North Sea. The UK has defined finer-scale assessment areas within the subregions. All habitat types are reported for almost all assessment areas, the exception being deep-sea habitats, which are found only in certain areas of the Celtic Seas. 

The assessment covers at least the major zones for seabed. For the water column, the assessment is made in a general fashion based on plankton communities. Understanding of other aspects of the community, microbes, fish, cephalopods, etc. was considered to be too much at an early stage of development to be incorporated in the assessment. No plans for including them at a later stage are given or for increasing their role in the water column, and the main focus for the future would continue to be consolidating information on plankton.

Where appropriate, the assessment of habitat types addresses both the abiotic (physical, hydrological, chemical) and biotic (community) aspects of each habitat. For each habitat, the habitat distribution, extent and condition have been reported. The information reported is mostly qualitative but for each habitat type, an assessment is made of its current state in relation to natural conditions (altered or in line) and for habitat condition, the share of the area assessed, which is affected is also reported. 

The main pressures and impacts on each seabed habitat type have been identified. However, the main pressures and impacts on pelagic habitats were not considered due to uncertainty as to:
- the extent of natural variability, climate change, ocean acidification and cascading effects from fishing which may be contributing to change;
- the limited understanding of the impacts of human pressures on some other components of the pelagic ecosystem, e.g. microbial communities and cephalopods, and the status of pelagic fish species that are not directly targeted by commercial fisheries;
- the impacts of fishing on key commercial pelagic fish stocks, which is taken into account in the assessments of commercial fish stocks.

Although they are not included in the reporting sheets, the UK refers in its paper report to special habitats covered by a range of protected area instruments (Natura 2000 sites, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar sites, Marine Conservation Zones and Scottish Marine Protected Areas) and confirms that demersal fishing activity is the main pressure on those sites as well.  

An assessment of the current status of habitat types has been made on the basis of the share of the assessment area affected (Large area impacted (>25%), Moderate area impacted (>10%-25%), Limited area impacted (<=10%)). In order to come to these conclusions, the UK has used three criteria: 1) current status of a specific habitat as a result of pressures associated with human activities; 2) recent trends to enable the interpretation of change in habitat condition in the last 10 years and 3) future prospects for the habitat (20 years into the future). In the reporting sheets, the UK specifies a threshold value for the assessment of status (“Total area of habitat lost should not exceed 15% of the baseline area and/or no more than 25% of baseline area of habitat should be impacted as a result of a pressure”) and a baseline (“Former natural conditions were used as the baseline, where both the area of extent of habitat prior to industrialisation, and a description of pristine habitat condition were considered”). However, these threshold values and baselines have not been used as a GES boundary. Most of the time a trend in status has also been provided. 

Ecosystems
No assessment has been made of ecosystems. ";The initial assessment by the UK of biological features is considered adequate. The major habitat types and species groups are covered. The information reported is mostly qualitative but quantitative trends are provided and the assessment is supported by the underlining analysis of Charting Progress 2. An assessment of status is made with explanations of how conclusions are reached. Reference is made to existing international conservation agreements and to the Habitats Directive.;"Features:
- Major habitat types and species groups are covered
- Mostly qualitative information and judgements but quantitative trends are provided
- Reference to the relevant international conventions and the Habitats Directive";3;Adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK has set combined environmental targets and indicators for D1, 4 and 6. Targets and associated indicators are not identified for individual descriptors but for specific biodiversity elements and have been organised according to six ecosystem components: three species groups (fish, birds, marine mammals), and three habitats groups (pelagic habitats, sediment habitats, rock and biogenic reef habitats). In Annex A of the paper report, the UK provides an indication of which target/indicator relates to each of the biodiversity descriptors. Following this classification, all environmental targets relate to D1. D4 is covered by all species targets and targets for pelagic habitats. With regard to D6, habitat targets apply but no species targets have been proposed. The UK justifies the lack of species targets by the fact that the approach to setting targets for this Descriptor focuses on sea-floor habitats and their associated species. 

Most targets are specific and potentially measurable since threshold values and baselines have been defined. However, many threshold values are actually not specific. Many of them include terms such as “no statistically significant decrease”, others provide a method to set a threshold value rather than an actual value (e.g. The distributional range in each admin area should not decrease, with statistical significance by x% or more for inshore winter gull roosts). In terms of baselines, an analysis of these has already been done when assessing the adequacy of the GES definitions. As mentioned, baselines are defined for many targets (mostly species targets) while for others, in particular habitat targets, a reference is made to the need to use different baselines, but no reason given as to why this is necessary. In Annex A of its paper report, the UK acknowledges that a vast majority of the targets/indicators defined for biodiversity need further development and will not be operational before 2014-2018. 

All targets and most indicators are state targets/indicators. One target is defined as a pressure target, related to the risk to island birds from non-native predators, and one is defined as an impact target, related to the mortality of cetaceans due to fishing by-catch. A few additional indicators are defined as pressure indicators when they relate to the reduction of specific pressures from human activities (e.g. fishing by-catch, contaminants, non-invasive species, physical loss and damage) to ensure that these do not adversely affect species and habitats. The fishing pressure (in particular bottom trawling), which is recognized as causing major negative impacts on habitat types in the initial assessment, is not specifically addressed in the biodiversity targets but may be captured under a more general target to significantly reduce areas which are 'unsustainably impacted'. It is not addressed either by the targets defined to cover Descriptor 3. The overall paucity of specific pressure/impact targets suggests the targets will not be sufficient to achieve GES.

The UK refers to several existing frameworks in its targets. In particular, the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive are extensively used to define baselines and threshold values where applicable. OSPAR’s EcoQOs however are not directly used in the text of the targets or indicators. However in the accompanying text to the targets and indicators, the existence of the EcoQOs is mentioned. It is not clear whether this means that they should be complied with. The UK does not directly refer to other international conservation agreements either in its targets (only in the accompanying text, e.g. ASCOBANS). This is in line with the UK approach, which has chosen to identify targets in addition to those already set by existing international commitments. This could explain why certain species are not at all addressed by the targets (because they are covered by existing international agreements) but since the UK does not list these agreements, it is not clear which ones are considered relevant or how these are incorporated into an overall assessment of GES. 

In terms of gaps in coverage, no targets have been defined for cephalopods, which is in line with the lack of assessment of this group’s current status. The UK justifies this gap with the lack of information and data for these species and acknowledges that further development work may be required as targets for these species would be an important part of assessing GES under Descriptors 1 and 4. No specific plan is proposed for the collection of additional data. 

Spatial gaps in the monitoring of pelagic, deep sea and coastal fish species have also been identified, which explains why the targets proposed are based on offshore assessment of demersal species and the baselines used for all fish-related targets relate to groundfish survey. Again, the lack of targets for these species is consistent with the lack of assessment of the current status of these species. But no suggestion is provided for how the gaps will be addressed.

No targets have been set related to energy flows within food webs, which is justified by the lack of knowledge on these issues. The UK also acknowledges that further knowledge is needed on the impacts of physical loss and damage on benthic habitats and their resilience to pressure. 

Looking at the targets that are relevant for D6, the overall targets for rock and reef habitat types are geared towards the maintenance (or improvement) of a baseline status or accept a deviation of a maximum of 5% of additional areas in poor condition from the baselines. However, baselines have not been defined yet (except Favourable Reference Area for Habitats Directive habitats). The overall targets for sediment habitat type also reflect the maintenance (or improvement) of a baseline status (not defined) and possible deviation from such baseline. It also reflects an ambition to reduce habitats impacted by human activities, although it is not clear which ones. Once again however, the baseline is not defined. For sediment habitat types, WFD targets for area of unacceptable impact for benthic invertebrates, macroalgae, saltmarsh and seagrass are to be used within WFD boundaries as appropriate.";The set of targets and indicators defined by the UK for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 is considered adequate. They are comprehensive in that they cover all the main elements of biodiversity and threshold values and baselines are specified. Some of the targets are only at an interim stage of development. Most targets are state oriented and, as such, constitute definitions of GES rather than targets to achieve GES. A few targets however address specific pressures and their impacts and thus will help ensure that GES can be met. A number of gaps have been identified in the targets. Most of them are acknowledged by the UK and are acceptable considering current state of knowledge but plans to address them are not systematically provided. ;"- Large number of specific targets
- Cover all elements of biodiversity comprehensively
- Most targets are SMART because they address specific elements and include thresholds and baselines
- Some targets are still under development
- A few targets address pressures";3;Adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D1;Consistency ;;"The assessment of pressures and biological features is in line with the definition of GES for D1, D4 and D6 as these are quite general. 

The setting of targets is consistent with the initial assessment apart from two issues:
-	The initial assessment acknowledges that the majority of the pressure exerted on seafloor habitats comes from fishing activities (and in particular bottom trawling) but it is not addressed by targets on the impacts of the fishing pressure. As the targets for Descriptor 3 are related to commercial fish stocks, they are not directly relevant for seabed habitats. 
-	The initial assessment acknowledges that many top predators and higher trophic levels are in a depleted state; however there are very few targets addressing these (only for seals, dolphins and porpoise). ";;;;
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK GES definition for D10 has provided a definition that consists of various components of the descriptor and indicators as provided in the 2010 Commission Decision. The GES definition sets two broadly defined conditions for the achievement of GES: 1) litter and its degradation products decreases over time and 2) levels do not pose a significant risk to the coastal and marine environment. The GES definition however does not specify the level of reduction required (threshold value). The UK GES definition does not distinguish between the floating litter, water column and seabed. Micro-particles are only implicitly and partly included as part of litter degradation products.  

Regarding the level of impact it is not clear what is considered a “significant” risk to the coastal and marine environment. Entanglement is reported as a direct cause of mortality. Bio-accumulation and reduced fecundity is considered as an indirect impact and could refer implicitly to the ingestion of plastic particles. ";The GES definition for D10 by the UK is partially adequate. The GES definition has been defined broadly at the descriptor level, but integrates elements of the criteria and indicators. The GES definition is specific with regard to the impacts (direct and indirect) that should be reduced and it includes an objective that marine litter in the environment is reduced over time. This implies that the baseline is the current status, but it is not clearly stated. In addition, the GES definition does not provide clear threshold values. This means that it is not clear how this reduction should be achieved. ;"- GES defined at descriptor level but integrates elements of the criteria and indicators of the Commission Decision

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK initial assessment of marine litter is comprehensive considering the information available. Sources and trends are indicated although the spatial coverage of data is not complete. Monitoring data suggest that further measures at national and international level will be needed to achieve GES with respect to litter both in the North Sea and Celtic Seas. 

The OSPAR EcoQO was not met in any subregions of the North-East Atlantic. Densities of beach litter recorded in the UK have increased since monitoring commenced in 1994, with an average of around 1000 items per kilometre in 1994 having almost doubled by 2007 although the trend was stable from 2003 to 2007. Seabed litter has been surveyed since 1992 on the back of existing fisheries cruises. Impacts of marine litter on marine life have however not been assessed due to the lack of agreed assessment tools. ";The UK initial assessment of marine litter is adequate. The UK has assessed sources and trends of marine litter for the North Sea and Celtic Seas using the information available. The impacts of marine litter are not assessed but this is understandable considering the current level of knowledge on the impacts of marine litter. ;"- Assessment of sources of litter and quantitative trends provided
- Limited information reported for impacts on ecosystem components
- Judgement made in relation to OSPAR EcoQO";3;Adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK reports three targets, each with one associated indicator. Target 1 aims for a reduction in marine litter while targets 2 and 3 are surveillance targets.

Target 1 is to achieve an overall reduction in the number of visible litter on coastlines. Threshold values have not been set and it is hence unclear how an overall reduction will be quantified, including spatial and temporal measurements. A rolling 5-10 year average is proposed as a baseline. 

Both targets 2 and 3 are interim surveillance targets that are to collect data and improve the understanding of marine litter. They relate respectively to seafloor litter and the amount of plastics found in Fulmars stomachs. The UK considers that too many uncertainties exist to set reduction targets now. For target 3 specifically the UK has not applied the OSPAR EcoQO target on the ingestion of plastic by Fulmars. The UK considers the impact of plastic particles on Fulmars to be unclear.  Finally no targets have been identified to address pressures (sources) of marine litter, despite the statement that marine litter should reduce over time in the GES definition. The targets overall show a low level of ambition. ";"The environmental targets and associated indicators are considered as partially adequate. The targets lack ambition; there is no target associated with litter in the sea itself. OSPAR EcoQO is not applied and no targets are identified to address pressures.";"- One target out of three is a pressure-reduction target, the other two are surveillance targets
- Pressure target only for litter on the beach, no target for litter in the sea
- Not quantified

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D10;Consistency ;;"The set of targets does not address the sources of litter which have been identified in the initial assessment and for which the relative proportion of their contribution to marine litter has been quantified. Micro-plastics and impacts on marine life have not been addressed by the targets which can be explained as being due to the limited data available on the subject. The UK states that impact of ingested litter on marine life is insufficiently clear and could therefore not set targets or include it in the GES definition. 

While the UK GES definition identifies a number of secondary impacts from marine litter that imply a thorough and ambitious approach for litter the targets do not reflect a similar level of ambition. In general, the set of targets has a limited scope and is not expected to achieve GES by 2020.";;;;
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has defined GES for D11at the descriptor and criteria levels. The GES definition only refers to underwater noise and does not include other forms of energy such as thermal energy, electromagnetic fields and light. GES is defined at the ecosystem level which is in line with the guidance from the D11 technical subgroup. 

The GES definition of the UK for D11 addresses specific types of impacts that can result from noise pressure such as through the masking of biologically significant sounds and behavioural reactions which reflects well the purpose of this indicator. The descriptor contains some vagueness as to which marine species will be considered when assessing whether GES is achieved since risk and impacts should be assessed 'at the population level or specifically to vulnerable/threatened species and key functional groups'. The logic for selection of species is not clear: why is 'or' inserted, why is 'vulnerable' used instead of sensitive and what constitutes 'key' groups.";The GES definition for Descriptor 11 is considered adequate. The UK definition has integrated the criteria from the Commission Decision and provides an indication of the scale at which this descriptor will be assessed. GES is defined on the basis of the indicators and developed even further. This is especially true for 11.2.1 which includes the notions of “masking” and “behavioural response”, which is exactly what the indicator is about. However, it lacks some clarity in how significant effects or risks are assessed and to which species it applies.;"- GES defined at descriptor and criteria levels

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK has reported in a qualitative way the potential impacts of noise and identified various anthropogenic sources of marine noise. The UK states that it expects the impulsive underwater noise events to increase but that the impacts will not increase at the temporal and spatial scales relevant to Descriptor 11. Ambient noise levels are also expected to increase if maritime traffic in the UK seas continues to increase. 

The UK expects it is unlikely that impulsive sounds will have significant adverse effects on marine animal populations, provided measures continue to be taken to manage the individual sources of noise through a process of licensing. The UK also states that there is currently insufficient knowledge to assess the impacts of noise on the populations of marine species. 

In the supporting document Charting Progress 2 Clean and Safe Seas Feeder Report, the available knowledge regarding noise in the UK has been collected. The Feeder report goes into some detail about the different pressures and mentions differences across their marine subregions. It also makes a clear reference to the OSPAR JAMP methodology. ";The initial assessment is considered as adequate. Reporting on sources and potential impacts is quite comprehensive. Even though the information presented in the paper report remains generic, due to the large amount of information gaps, it is supported by detailed and comprehensive background documents. ;"- Comprehensive reporting on sources of noise and impacts on ecosystem components
- Clear to OSPAR JAMP methodology

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D11;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK defines two targets, each associated with one indicator, to cover D11. The first target requires the development of a noise registry. The second target aims to collect more data on ambient noise by 2018. The data collected by the surveillance indicators should help develop appropriate targets by 2018.

A baseline has been defined for both targets and they include threshold values. The targets are therefore SMART. They are based on guidance from the Commission Decision and from the GES Noise Technical Subgroup to initially set up data collection since current knowledge on baselines and the impacts of noise on the marine environment are not sufficient to quantify the indicators. The targets also seem to have taken into account the latest conclusions from the D11 technical subgroup.  ";The two targets defined for D11 by the UK are adequate. They are pragmatic considering the current knowledge available regarding noise and the latest guidance from the Noise Technical Subgroup and are SMART. ;"- SMART and pragmatic targets

Therefore the establishment of a noise registry is a first step to collect the data required to manage underwater noise in such a way that it does not adversely affect the marine ecosystem.;;;;
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The definition of GES for Descriptor 2 applies to both the Celtic Seas and the Greater North Sea sub-regions. It does not reproduce verbatim the definition of Annex I of the MSFD. The UK has set GES for Descriptor 2 at a high-level and in a qualitative way, with a focus on reducing the risk of introduction rather than on impacts as per the Directive. 

The GES definition addresses the reduction of the risk from pathways and vectors of introducing and spreading non-indigenous species, including invasive ones, covering in a very indirect way criterion 2.1 of the Commission Decision. There is no reference to the levels of NIS in the environment and their spread, as addressed by the Directive and Decision, such as 'no further increase of NIS (introductions) and no further spread, where possible'. The definition of GES does not include any baseline, threshold or reference condition, which are considered as not relevant and effectively means that 'significantly reduced' cannot be measured. No indication on further development status is given in the reporting sheet. ";The GES definition for D2 is considered as partially adequate. One of the criteria of the Commission Decision is not used and this without justification (criterion 2.2). The other criterion (criterion 2.1) is covered only in an indirect manner. It takes a risk-based approach and, consequently, does not aim at ‘no new introductions’ but rather a reduction of the risk. It does not include the current pressure of NIS. There are no baseline or reference conditions.. GES is defined in very general terms. ;"- GES definition does not cover directly the Commission Decision’s criteria
- No baseline or reference points";2;Partially adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK provides a list of 58 NIS for the Celtic Seas and 95 NIS for the North Sea. In relation to the level of pressure on the environment, it indicates that there is no consensus on numbers considered to be invasive, with limited information on their current or previous distribution and insufficient time series data at regional scale to assess trends. However, the general trend is assessed as increasing. The impact of the pressure on the water column and seabed habitats is described but in a limited fashion. At the functional group level, the UK only notes that there is limited evidence of impacts of non-indigenous species. In general, the UK mentions information gaps in relation to summary information on proportion of assessment area affected, regional scale trends and impacts due to a lack of information available on the distribution, abundance and trends in distribution of invasive species within the assessment area. The UK describes plans to address these gaps, namely through implementing the targets and indicators for D2.

The UK describes in detail the main pathways (maritime transport and aquaculture). However, no ranking is provided as the relative significance of each of these vectors depends on the group of species concerned. 

The UK recognises the need to develop, in the long-term, detailed baseline information on the abundance of NIS, in particular through OSPAR activities so as to ensure ‘a regional approach is taken in regards to monitoring and preventing movement of NIS’.";The initial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered adequate for both UK sub-regions covered by the assessment. The UK has provided a list of NIS and some information on the level of pressure. The general trend for the pressure is provided.

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"For both marine sub-regions, two general targets have been set with associated indicators.

The UK targets for D2 are new in the sense that there are no specific targets for NIS in existing national, EU and regional legislation. The UK has followed a risk-based approach. The accompanying text to the targets further specifies that they ‘require the implementation of management measures to reduce the risk from key pathways and vectors of introduction and spread of NIS, and the development and implementation of management plans for dealing with key high-risk species should they arrive in UK waters’.

The UK recognises the need to further elaborate the necessary measures additional to what is already in place e.g. IMO initiative on introduction from international shipping. The UK indicates that further work will be done between now and 2015 as part of the development of the programmes of measures. 

The first target is a pressure-target. The target is to reduce risk of introductions and spread, but without a baseline and a more specific target, this is difficult to measure. Introductions are monitored by a surveillance indicator. While the development of action plans for key high risk species is useful, these are spread over a very long time frame. There seems to be a monitoring of NIS, but there are no clear actions (yet) to prevent/reduce the risk of introductions and if established to limit their spread.

It is not considered as a SMART target as while it can be considered as specific (reduce risk) and time-bound (December 2020), it is not measurable, achievable and realistic. Combined with the vague definitions of GES, there is no quantification, thresholds, reference conditions and baseline. No specification is given as to how to reduce the risk, to which levels and which sectors or pathways to address.

The same remarks apply to the second target, which is an impact-target. It only requires a general reduction of impacts and does not give any information on how to reduce those and which vectors and pathways to address.

Indicator 2.2.1 is not covered. In its paper report, the UK recognises that it has not been possible to explicitly cover all elements of Descriptor 2 from the Commission Decision, ‘due mainly to the lack of data and full understanding of NIS in respect to abundance, distribution, introduction (vectors and timing) and ability to survive in new environments’. It suggests that additional monitoring or changes to existing monitoring may be needed in line with the risk based management approach and the proposed surveillance indicator.";This set of two general targets is considered as inadequate to achieve GES, which is itself defined in a rather vague way. The targets relate directly to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts but without any specification. Given the lack of details, they are not considered SMART.;"- The targets relate directly to a reduction in the identified pressures/impacts but without any specification

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK GES definition for Descriptor 3 incorporates criteria 3.1 and 3.2 and applies them in accordance with the Commission guidance. Fishing mortality has been set at or below Fmsy, however it is not clarified to which stocks this limit applies. Criteria 3.2 reproductive capacity of the stock applies SSBpa, which is in accordance with the descriptor text in MSFD Annex I; however it has not been clarified whether this limit applies to all stocks.

In the case of criteria 3.3 the UK has not applied this criterion due to the inability to set targets and parameters for the criteria and associated indicators at present. The justification provide for the exclusion of the criteria reads: “Scientific advice concludes that is it not possible to set targets for these parameters at this time. There is on-going scientific debate regarding if this criterion is relevant, when 3.1/3.2 are being achieved”

During the working group Paris workshop 24-25 April 2012 however it was agreed that criterion 3.3 “is useful, which allows consideration and inclusion of important secondary data into the strategy, and that it should be included wherever available. There are no reference levels for the indicators, so it can only be complementary to other criteria.” ";The GES definition for Descriptor 3 by the UK is considered partially adequate. Criteria 3.1 and 3.2 have been applied in accordance with the guidance provided by the Commission, which is adequate, under the condition that the GES definition applies to all stocks. In the case of Criteria 3.3 this should be included although in a complementary fashion and therefore the exclusion of this criterion is not adequate based on the conclusions from the Paris workshop in 2012.;"- Stocks at Fmsy

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK in their paper report have provided a single initial assessment for both the North Sea and Celtic Sea subregions but in the reporting sheets have provided two separate assessments. The assessment of the level of and impacts from the pressure caused by the extraction of fish and shellfish (fisheries) has been done at a similar level of detail and using a similar methodology for both marine subregions.

The UK assessment on the level of fisheries pressure has not been reported using the fishing vessel characterizations defined for MSFD reporting and instead reports trends related to all fishing activities.  In regard to the North Sea the UK reports that the total fishing effort (kW days) of the international fishing fleet has declined by around 27% since 2002, however for the Celtic Seas only qualitative information regarding fishing effort is provided. For both subregions the initial assessment of fishing pressure is general and lacks details.

The overview of the fishing impacts on seabed habitats, functional groups and commercially exploited fish stocks have been described in a general qualitative fashion and do not link specific impacts to specific types of fisheries. In the reporting sheets the UK states that in both the North Sea and Celtic Sea 5-25% of seabed habitats which may be under-estimated) and 5 out of 13 functional groups are impacted by fisheries.

In regard to stock assessments the UK provides ICES assessments from 2011, which found that for the North Sea stocks of commercial interest to the UK and for which robust scientific assessments were possible 64% were exploited at a level equal to or below Fmsy and 91% had a SSB equal to or above SSBpa. For Celtic Sea stocks of commercial interest to the UK and for which robust scientific assessments were possible 61% were exploited at a level equal to or below Fmsy and 72% had a SSB equal to or above SSBpa. The UK report states that these numbers imply that around half of the stocks in UK waters will need to improve to achieve GES, but also that the status of a third of all commercial finfish stocks in UK waters are currently not quantitatively assessed.  In the case of shellfish stocks the UK for the North Sea states that 25% of stocks are exploited at a level equal to or below the Fmsy proxy and 75% have a SSB equal to or above the Bpa/Btrigger level. For the Celtic sea the UK states that 70% of the stocks are exploited at a level equal to or below the Fmsy proxy and 100% of stocks have a SSB equal to or above the BPA/Btrigger level. Several species are not being assessed, especially shellfish such as scallops, winkles, bivalves, some crabs and crayfish. 

The UK initial assessment also reports that in regard to the pressure and impacts of fisheries the situation is improving for seabed habitats, functional groups and exploited fish stocks while trends for impacts on shellfish stocks are unknown. ";The initial assessment is considered partially adequate. The UK initial assessment does not describe in detail the pressure from fishing activities (i.e. fishing effort) nor does it describe in detail the impacts of these pressures on elements other than for commercially exploited stocks.

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D3;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK has provided 2 targets with one associated indicator for each. In the reporting sheet, the UK provides threshold values for both targets (Fmsy for Target 1 and SSB for Target 2) and baselines. The baseline for Target 1 is: “Stocks with analytical estimates of fishing mortality: The agreed management plan long-term target fishing mortality/exploitation rate. The ICES estimate of FMSY or optimum exploitation rate. Stocks without analytical estimates of fishing mortality: An agreed proxy for exploitation rate derived from the stock age/length structure”. The baseline for Target 2 is: “Stocks with analytical estimates of spawning/total biomass, or proxies for them, the baseline would be the agreed, stock specific management threshold. Currently ICES uses the threshold Btrigger in association with the FMSY target value.” 

The targets apply to all stocks covered by the DCF and use ICES estimates for the level of fisheries pressure and ICES estimates for the reproductive capacity of stocks. The target deadlines are set for 2020-12, which is in line with the MSFD to achieve GES by 2020. In a situation where ICES is unable to provide MSY estimates for the level of fishing pressure for all stocks the UK will use Fpa limits instead for stocks without MSY limits. This could potentially prevent the achievement of GES according to a strict interpretation of the MSFD that all stocks should be exploited at or below Fmsy.";The targets defined by the UK to cover Descriptor 3 are considered adequate. The UK targets are clear, contain thresholds and timelines and indicate which stocks are to be addressed by the targets. The targets also match the MSFD ambition for EU fisheries to exploit all fish stocks at a level equal to or below Fmsy. Only where Fmsy cannot be determined will Fpa be applied. Furthermore the targets require that the SSB of all DCF stocks are maintained at or above PA levels.;"- Clear target requiring all stocks (with analytical assessment) to be exploited at Fmsy

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D4;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"As for D1, GES is defined at descriptor level, incorporating aspects of some criteria. With regard to criteria, although productivity of key species or tropic groups (criterion 4.1) is not explicitly mentioned in the GES definition, it is however implicit in the GES definition. Similarly although the GES definition does not specifically mention species at the top of the food web (criterion 4.2) or the abundance/distribution of key trophic groups/species (criterion 4.3), the definition can be interpreted as recognising the importance of a balanced functioning food web for which these criteria are important. 

Although there is no specific species mentioned, nor baseline, the GES definition refers directly to the targets set for species and pelagic habitats but not for benthic habitats. The accompanying text specifies the lack of current knowledge about energy transfer between trophic levels and species interaction to meaningfully cover these within the targets for this Descriptor. Therefore, the UK has decided to focus on the abundance, distribution and productivity of key species and trophic groups within the food web, setting targets which are combined with those set for Descriptor 1.

The targets defined to cover biodiversity cover all D4 criteria, all primary indicators and most secondary indicators. They cover most relevant elements of marine food webs however there is a lack of targets relating to higher trophic levels and top predators among fish species (sharks, skates, rays, large diadromous and pelagic fish, etc.) while the initial assessment has recognized that these species remain severely depleted. The UK does however mention that many of these species are covered by international conservation agreements, which may explain the lack of targets. Finally, only two targets address by-catch (for cetaceans and seals) and none address discards, which are considered as key pressures on food webs in the GES definition.  

The same analysis regarding baselines applies as that made for D1. 

From Descriptor 1 assessment (Partially adequate; 2):

Reference to past or “desired” states as baselines are not directly mentioned in the GES definition and the definition refers to “prevailing environmental conditions as defined by specific targets for species and habitats”. In the separate document listing all the final targets submitted by the UK to the Commission on 30 April 2013, baselines are provided for most targets. Many baselines are based on complete time series of data (best available). Favourable Reference Areas are also used as baselines for Habitats Directive habitats, which should be seen as ‘reference conditions’. Two exceptions should be noted: for pelagic, the baselines are only defined as “set in the past (but not as a reference to pristine conditions)” and for rock and reef and sediment habitats it is acknowledged that different baselines are needed for specific habitats and as such none are given.

For criteria 1.1 to 1.6, the definition of GES is generally based on the reference condition (‘prevailing environmental conditions’). For criterion 1 7, it is based on the general principle of reference condition (‘specific structures and functions necessary for their long-term maintenance exist for the foreseeable future’) plus acceptable deviation (‘not significantly impacted’).";Taking into account that D4 requires unfamiliar assessment approaches, the GES definition for D4 by the UK is considered to be partially adequate. Read in conjunction with the environmental targets, which it directly refers to, the definition covers all of the Commission criteria and most indicators, although there seems to be gaps in the coverage of trophic levels and many aspects of the definition are rather vague. ;"- GES definition set at a high, qualitative level but refers directly to the environmental targets

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D4;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Adequate; 3):

The UK has set combined environmental targets and indicators for D1, 4 and 6. Targets and associated indicators are not identified for individual descriptors but for specific biodiversity elements and have been organised according to six ecosystem components: three species groups (fish, birds, marine mammals), and three habitats groups (pelagic habitats, sediment habitats, rock and biogenic reef habitats). In Annex A of the paper report, the UK provides an indication of which target/indicator relates to each of the biodiversity descriptors. Following this classification, all environmental targets relate to D1. D4 is covered by all species targets and targets for pelagic habitats. With regard to D6, habitat targets apply but no species targets have been proposed. The UK justifies the lack of species targets by the fact that the approach to setting targets for this Descriptor focuses on sea-floor habitats and their associated species. 

Most targets are specific and potentially measurable since threshold values and baselines have been defined. However, many threshold values are actually not specific. Many of them include terms such as “no statistically significant decrease”, others provide a method to set a threshold value rather than an actual value (e.g. The distributional range in each admin area should not decrease, with statistical significance by x% or more for inshore winter gull roosts). In terms of baselines, an analysis of these has already been done when assessing the adequacy of the GES definitions. As mentioned, baselines are defined for many targets (mostly species targets) while for others, in particular habitat targets, a reference is made to the need to use different baselines, but no reason given as to why this is necessary. In Annex A of its paper report, the UK acknowledges that a vast majority of the targets/indicators defined for biodiversity need further development and will not be operational before 2014-2018. 

All targets and most indicators are state targets/indicators. One target is defined as a pressure target, related to the risk to island birds from non-native predators, and one is defined as an impact target, related to the mortality of cetaceans due to fishing by-catch. A few additional indicators are defined as pressure indicators when they relate to the reduction of specific pressures from human activities (e.g. fishing by-catch, contaminants, non-invasive species, physical loss and damage) to ensure that these do not adversely affect species and habitats. The fishing pressure (in particular bottom trawling), which is recognized as causing major negative impacts on habitat types in the initial assessment, is not specifically addressed in the biodiversity targets but may be captured under a more general target to significantly reduce areas which are 'unsustainably impacted'. It is not addressed either by the targets defined to cover Descriptor 3. The overall paucity of specific pressure/impact targets suggests the targets will not be sufficient to achieve GES.

The UK refers to several existing frameworks in its targets. In particular, the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive are extensively used to define baselines and threshold values where applicable. OSPAR’s EcoQOs however are not directly used in the text of the targets or indicators. However in the accompanying text to the targets and indicators, the existence of the EcoQOs is mentioned. It is not clear whether this means that they should be complied with. The UK does not directly refer to other international conservation agreements either in its targets (only in the accompanying text, e.g. ASCOBANS). This is in line with the UK approach, which has chosen to identify targets in addition to those already set by existing international commitments. This could explain why certain species are not at all addressed by the targets (because they are covered by existing international agreements) but since the UK does not list these agreements, it is not clear which ones are considered relevant or how these are incorporated into an overall assessment of GES. 

In terms of gaps in coverage, no targets have been defined for cephalopods, which is in line with the lack of assessment of this group’s current status. The UK justifies this gap with the lack of information and data for these species and acknowledges that further development work may be required as targets for these species would be an important part of assessing GES under Descriptors 1 and 4. No specific plan is proposed for the collection of additional data. 

Spatial gaps in the monitoring of pelagic, deep sea and coastal fish species have also been identified, which explains why the targets proposed are based on offshore assessment of demersal species and the baselines used for all fish-related targets relate to groundfish survey. Again, the lack of targets for these species is consistent with the lack of assessment of the current status of these species. But no suggestion is provided for how the gaps will be addressed.

No targets have been set related to energy flows within food webs, which is justified by the lack of knowledge on these issues. The UK also acknowledges that further knowledge is needed on the impacts of physical loss and damage on benthic habitats and their resilience to pressure. 

Looking at the targets that are relevant for D6, the overall targets for rock and reef habitat types are geared towards the maintenance (or improvement) of a baseline status or accept a deviation of a maximum of 5% of additional areas in poor condition from the baselines. However, baselines have not been defined yet (except Favourable Reference Area for Habitats Directive habitats). The overall targets for sediment habitat type also reflect the maintenance (or improvement) of a baseline status (not defined) and possible deviation from such baseline. It also reflects an ambition to reduce habitats impacted by human activities, although it is not clear which ones. Once again however, the baseline is not defined. For sediment habitat types, WFD targets for area of unacceptable impact for benthic invertebrates, macroalgae, saltmarsh and seagrass are to be used within WFD boundaries as appropriate.";"From Descriptor 1 , 4, 6 assessment:


The set of targets and indicators defined by the UK for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 is considered adequate. They are comprehensive in that they cover all the main elements of biodiversity and threshold values and baselines are specified. Some of the targets are only at an interim stage of development. Most targets are state oriented and, as such, constitute definitions of GES rather than targets to achieve GES. A few targets however address specific pressures and their impacts and thus will help ensure that GES can be met. A number of gaps have been identified in the targets. Most of them are acknowledged by the UK and are acceptable considering current state of knowledge but plans to address them are not systematically provided. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

The setting of targets is consistent with the initial assessment apart from two issues:
-	The initial assessment acknowledges that the majority of the pressure exerted on seafloor habitats comes from fishing activities (and in particular bottom trawling) but it is not addressed by targets on the impacts of the fishing pressure. As the targets for Descriptor 3 are related to commercial fish stocks, they are not directly relevant for seabed habitats. 
-	The initial assessment acknowledges that many top predators and higher trophic levels are in a depleted state; ";;;;
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"UK has defined GES for descriptor 5 at descriptor and criteria levels. The definition is the same in the paper report and the reporting sheets and applies to both UK marine regions: the North Sea and the Celtic Seas. GES definition encompasses all criteria but is not defined at the indicator level.  

The term “undesirable disturbance” is used and is specified in the paper report as being demonstrated “when adverse effects resulting from nutrient enrichment and accelerated growth of algae occur, such as losses in biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, harmful algal blooms and oxygen deficiency in bottom waters”. Even with the definition, this remains unspecific in terms of GES boundary and baseline to measure achievement of GES. 

The approach used by the UK is risk-based, in line with the OSPAR Common Procedure based on identification of non-problem areas . The OSPAR approach to tackling eutrophication takes into account criteria used for national assessment purposes, so MSFD GES should equate to at least WFD GES. However, no explicit statement of this is made in the GES definition of the accompanying text. Which WFD and OSPAR methodologies/thresholds are used remains unclear, although OSPAR baselines/thresholds are reported in the pressure-impacts analysis (Article 8). However, they are not incorporated in the definition of GES.";The GES definition of UK for D5 is assessed as partially adequate. GES appears to be largely determined via achievement of targets. The risk-based approach is regarded as pragmatic and cost-effective, but the lack of thresholds/reference levels makes it difficult to determine whether GES has been achieved. Those criteria which are described in the targets and initial assessment are not incorporated into the definition of GES. In addition, neither a perennial macrophyobenthos-based indicator (5.3.1), in association with an opportunistic macroalgal-based indicator (5.2.3), is incorporated for both OSPAR eutrophication problem and non-problem areas to ensure that areas in GES remain so.;"- GES definition encompasses all the criteria of the 2010 Commission Decision

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"North Sea
UK has carried out an initial assessment on the level of pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the North Sea. The summary information presented – qualitative and quantitative (in the reporting sheets) – is based on the established OSPAR Comprehensive Procedure for eutrophication status assessment in the marine environment and is supported by the Charting Progress 2 report, which includes a trend analysis of nitrogen and phosphorous inputs to the marine environment. The assessment includes three areas that had previously been assessed as areas of ongoing concern (East England, East Anglia, and the Solent). These areas were shown to be nutrient-enriched, but there was no evidence of undesirable disturbance, and the trend in nutrient loading pressure indicates that the risk is not increasing. Input loads of nitrogen and phosphorus from river discharges and atmospheric deposition are reported, showing that between 1990 and 2007 nutrient loads to the marine environment generally decreased. Input loads of organic matter are not reported in the paper report or the reporting sheet. Inputs from adjacent marine waters appear to be relatively small. However, nutrient and organic levels within the water column itself are not reported. 

Agriculture, forestry and urban discharges are referred as the main cause of eutrophication.

Impacts on pelagic features are said to be reducing, but overall the status is described as stable. No information is provided on the status of phytobenthos communities, which is monitored for WFD purposes in coastal waters, on dissolved oxygen status, or on loads from direct discharges and groundwater inputs in the paper report or the reporting sheet. 

The UK refers to a recent OSPAR modelling study on transboundary impacts from eutrophication in the Greater North Sea. The conclusion was that there is very little transfer of nutrients from human activities from one country to another. 

No conclusive judgement is made on the current level of eutrophication in the North Sea in relation to GES.

Celtic Seas
UK has carried out an initial assessment – qualitative and quantitative (in the reporting sheets) - on the level of pressure and the impacts of eutrophication in the Celtic Seas, using the OSPAR Comprehensive Procedure to assess trophic status and is supported by the Charting Progress 2 report. All relevant nutrients are considered in terms of terrestrial loads (decreasing trends with recent load estimation for each) with minor inputs from adjacent marine waters, but the overall description of pressures is given as ‘stable’, not decreasing/improving. Organic loads and concentrations are not assessed; neither is any assessment made of nutrient or organic concentrations in the water column, yet reference/threshold values are given for nutrients, dissolved oxygen, opportunistic macroalgae and phytoplankton-based assessment metrics, which should have been reported under Article 9. Impacts on seabed habitats are not assessed, but those on water column/phytoplankton populations are considered. 

Agriculture, forestry and urban discharges are referred as the main cause of eutrophication. No conclusive judgement is made on the current level of eutrophication in the Celtic Seas in relation to GES; however the UK reports that there are relatively few eutrophication problem areas in the Celtic Seas at present and that the problem areas are considered to be outside the scope of the MSFD (i.e. the Transitional Waters), are of limited size and are addressed by existing measures. ";The initial assessment of UK for eutrophication in both subregions is assessed as partially adequate. The initial assessment reports on the input of all the relevant nutrients but not organic matter. In addition, concentration levels of nutrients and organic matter in the water column (even though reference values are given), as well as impacts on seabed habitats, including the status of phytobenthos communities, are not assessed in the reporting sheet or the paper report. The judgement that there are few eutrophication problem areas in the UK marine environment seems a valid conclusion considering the information provided, but while impacts appear to be well understood, recent status is insufficiently reported.;"- Covers all nutrients but not organic matter
- Limited assessment of impacts
- Judgement on current status but not in relation to MSFD GES";2;Partially adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D5;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK has developed nine environmental targets to address eutrophication. The same targets are reported in the reporting sheets and in the paper report, applying to both marine regions. The targets use a risk-based approach: where eutrophication problems have been shown not to exist then the target is simply to maintain non-problem area status based on specific parameters (DIN, Chl a, plankton), but for areas which have been identified as eutrophication problem areas, a more comprehensive set of targets are used to bring them to non-problem area status. These includes criteria (nutrient concentrations, direct and indirect effects), and five indicators. 

Thus, for OSPAR-acknowledged eutrophication problem areas, indicators 5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.4, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 are used, while for acknowledged non-problem areas only indicators 5.1.1, 5.2.1 and 5.2.4 are used. It is unclear why indicator 5.3.1 is not applied to OSPAR non-problem areas, since the monitoring data will continue to be collected for WFD purposes, and this would allow eutrophication status to continue to be assessed for target achievement purposes at all of the criteria level, and for both water column and seabed features. Otherwise, only pelagic features may be reported for MSFD purposes. The absence of indicator 5.2.1 (water transparency in relation to chlorophyll) appears to be due to the high lithological/non-phytoplankton-derived organic content of suspended solids in the UK’s waters.

The targets are all specific and measurable, but the indicators for two of the targets are still under development, so while raw data are currently held, no baseline can be applied at present. The targets are all considered realistic and achievable by 2020. However the UK does state that “it needs to be acknowledged that recovery from eutrophication, for example in small estuaries and embayments, can take many years, due to the large reservoirs of nutrients in sediments”.

The targets presented for OSPAR problem areas seen sufficiently ambitious to achieve GES. For non-problem areas, the assumption appears to be that GES for D5 will be maintained, considering the pressure reduction measures which have been and are continuing to be undertaken via the WFD and related legislation. It is not clear how ‘mortality of benthic animals associated with oxygen deficiency’ will be assessed if continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen status is not monitored in all UK OSPAR eutrophication problem areas.

The targets are consistent as a set. However, they do not cover seabed features in non-problem areas, when macrophytobenthos indices could indicate significant groundwater inputs of nutrients, i.e. impacts that would otherwise go unnoticed. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by UK for D5 is assessed as adequate. The set of targets is consistent and all targets are specific, measurable, achievable and realistic. It covers all criteria of the Commission Decision and a majority of the indicators.;"- Consistent set of targets

- SMART
- Ambitious at least for OSPAR problem areas";3;Adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of eutrophication and its impacts is not considered consistent with the UK definition of GES. The definition of GES refers to nutrient concentrations, direct and indirect impacts, but with very little detail and a complete absence of baselines/thresholds, although assessments are to be based on a combination of OSPAR and WFD procedures/methodologies. However, exactly which procedures are not stated. Details of some baselines/thresholds are provided in the targets and others in the initial assessment, but it requires considerable effort to dig these out, and even then it is not clear whether they are all applicable for MSFD purposes. Pressures are assessed in terms of nutrients only (not organic loads), but monitored impacts are poorly described, despite strong suggestions that a considerable body of evidence has been established to support the overall conclusions. In particular, impacts on seabed communities appear to be lacking.

The risk-based approach to target-setting means that more targets are set for OSPAR-acknowledged eutrophication problem areas than non-problem areas. Not all impacts have been reported, in particular impacts on seabed features, and it appears that direct WWT plant and groundwater inputs have not been considered in pressure calculations. Certainly, organic inputs from land have not, but dissolved oxygen status does not appear to be an issue. 

The UK believes that trophic status is already well controlled, to the extent that GES for Descriptor 5 will be achieved in UK waters by 2020 in the light of existing planned pressure-reduction under the UWWT and Nitrates directives. ";;;;
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The GES definition for Descriptor 6 is set at descriptor level. The definition in itself does not cover the Commission Decision criteria and indicators, in particular it does not address the condition of the benthic community (criterion 6.2) and only addresses habitats such that they carry out natural functionality.

The definition is rather vague and many terms are not sufficiently specific to assess whether GES is achieved or not (e.g. “sufficiently extensive”, “necessary ecological processes”, “healthy and sustainable”). This is in line with how GES has been defined for Descriptors 1 and 4 but in the case of Descriptor 6, no direct reference is made to the targets to further specify the various elements of the GES definition. Therefore there is no particular reference to the relevant biogenic substrate and substrate types, as referred to in the Decision, that are covered by the definition. 

In addition, the definition of D6 in the Directive refers to safeguarded ecosystems and benthic ecosystems that are not adversely affected. However, the definition of D6 by the UK is set from a different angle as it refers to productive habitats which underpin ecosystem goods and services. Through this approach, the UK definition therefore does not specifically focus on the condition of benthic ecosystems, as required by the Decision, to ensure they will be safeguarded and not adversely affected, since they can be affected (e.g. by human activities) as long as they remain sufficiently productive 'to carry out natural functionality'.  

Since it is defined from a “sustainability” angle, rather than a “conservation” angle, the definition of D6 by the UK does not mention any baselines (no mention of ‘reference conditions’ or ‘prevailing physiographic, geographic and climatic (natural) conditions) for the restoration or maintenance of current status. ";The GES definition for D6 by the UK is considered inadequate. The general GES definition is not specific enough and is only set at the descriptor level. There is no reference to the targets (as is done for Descriptors 1 and 4), which would allow for further specification (e.g. of substrate types).  The GES definition does not at all address criterion 6.2 on the condition of the benthic community. It is therefore highly uncertain whether the descriptor is sufficiently ambitious to achieve the objective of the MSFD.;"- GES definition does not cover all the criteria of the Commission Decision

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures (physical loss and physical damage) (Partially adequate, 2):

The UK has made a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant types and causes of physical loss in their marine waters. These include significant physical loss in the intertidal zone, due to land claim and construction of coastal defences and infrastructure, coastal squeeze of intertidal sediment habitats due to rising sea levels and presence of immobile coastal defence structures, renewable energy devices, aggregate extraction and fisheries. The UK acknowledges however that it has not made an assessment of which activity causes most pressure. With regard to physical damage, although there are a number of activities that impact the seabed and surface features, the spatial extent of disturbance from fishing activities is considered to outweigh contributions from other sources. Therefore the focus for the assessment is solely on fisheries.

A mostly qualitative description is provided on the level of physical loss and physical damage in the marine waters, mainly related to where it is taking place, complemented with a few qualitative trends on the extent to which it is taking place. It is assessed that 5-25% of the area assessed is affected by physical damage, which may be underestimated. No such assessment has been made for physical loss, which is mostly localised. Demersal fishing activity, the main source of physical damage, is predicted to decrease in spatial extent between 2010 and 2020 (and beyond to 2030). 

The UK acknowledges that knowledge of the full spatial distribution and intensity of physical loss is the limited, in particular due to the unavailability of collated quantitative data on the distribution of human activities and pressures across the subregions. 

The impacts of physical loss and physical damage on seabed habitats and their associated communities are however well documented and reported, although still qualitative. The picture depicted by the UK assessment is rather negative as it points to many habitats and species impacted all over the UK marine waters (e.g. intertidal sediments and water birds because of land claim and coastal defence, biogenic reefs because of mobile fishing gear, etc.). An assessment has been made of the proportion of features impacted by physical damage (5-25%). 

The UK has not made a conclusive judgement on the level of, and impacts from, physical loss and physical damage. It justifies that by stating that no methodology is currently in place to assess the impact of this pressure on the UK seabed at a regional scale and the data to do so are not complete. However, the UK also presents the steps that are being taken to address those gaps, which should support the revision of the initial assessment in the next MSFD assessment round (e.g. development of data layers for priority pressures). 

Biological features (Adequate; 3):

Habitats
The UK has reported on a number of seabed habitat types (littoral sediment, intertidal rock, subtidal rock, shallow subtidal sediments, shelf subtidal sediments and deep-sea habitats), following the EUNIS level 2 categories rather than the pre-defined list of predominant habitat types (except for littoral sediment and littoral (intertidal) rock). However, the UK classification can be considered broadly equivalent to the MSFD classification, but with several types more aggregated by the UK. No fine-level habitats have been reported. The same habitat types are reported for the Celtic Seas and the North Sea. The UK has defined finer-scale assessment areas within the subregions. All habitat types are reported for almost all assessment areas, the exception being deep-sea habitats, which are found only in certain areas of the Celtic Seas. 

The assessment covers at least the major zones for seabed. For the water column, the assessment is made in a general fashion based on plankton communities. Understanding of other aspects of the community, microbes, fish, cephalopods, etc. was considered to be too much at an early stage of development to be incorporated in the assessment. No plans for including them at a later stage are given or for increasing their role in the water column, and the main focus for the future would continue to be consolidating information on plankton.

Where appropriate, the assessment of habitat types addresses both the abiotic (physical, hydrological, chemical) and biotic (community) aspects of each habitat. For each habitat, the habitat distribution, extent and condition have been reported. The information reported is mostly qualitative but for each habitat type, an assessment is made of its current state in relation to natural conditions (altered or in line) and for habitat condition, the share of the area assessed, which is affected is also reported. 

The main pressures and impacts on each seabed habitat type have been identified. However, the main pressures and impacts on pelagic habitats were not considered due to uncertainty as to:
- the extent of natural variability, climate change, ocean acidification and cascading effects from fishing which may be contributing to change;
- the limited understanding of the impacts of human pressures on some other components of the pelagic ecosystem, e.g. microbial communities and cephalopods, and the status of pelagic fish species that are not directly targeted by commercial fisheries;
- the impacts of fishing on key commercial pelagic fish stocks, which is taken into account in the assessments of commercial fish stocks.

Although they are not included in the reporting sheets, the UK refers in its paper report to special habitats covered by a range of protected area instruments (Natura 2000 sites, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar sites, Marine Conservation Zones and Scottish Marine Protected Areas) and confirms that demersal fishing activity is the main pressure on those sites as well.  

An assessment of the current status of habitat types has been made on the basis of the share of the assessment area affected (Large area impacted (>25%), Moderate area impacted (>10%-25%), Limited area impacted (<=10%)). In order to come to these conclusions, the UK has used three criteria: 1) current status of a specific habitat as a result of pressures associated with human activities; 2) recent trends to enable the interpretation of change in habitat condition in the last 10 years and 3) future prospects for the habitat (20 years into the future). In the reporting sheets, the UK specifies a threshold value for the assessment of status (“Total area of habitat lost should not exceed 15% of the baseline area and/or no more than 25% of baseline area of habitat should be impacted as a result of a pressure”) and a baseline (“Former natural conditions were used as the baseline, where both the area of extent of habitat prior to industrialisation, and a description of pristine habitat condition were considered”). However, these threshold values and baselines have not been used as a GES boundary. Most of the time a trend in status has also been provided. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

Pressures:
The initial assessment by the UK of physical loss and damage is considered partially adequate. The different types and causes of physical loss and damage are well documented and reported. The UK states there are gaps in the knowledge of the features affected and the geographical region where they occur; however the available evidence for physical damage, which suggests the effects of bottom fishing gear are much more extensive than reported, does not appear to have been used. There are also gaps in the knowledge on the distribution of human activities and pressures across the sub-region and there is a general lack of quantification of the intensity and extent of the pressures. However the UK has acknowledged these gaps and provided plans to address them.

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment (Adequate; 3):

The UK has set combined environmental targets and indicators for D1, 4 and 6. Targets and associated indicators are not identified for individual descriptors but for specific biodiversity elements and have been organised according to six ecosystem components: three species groups (fish, birds, marine mammals), and three habitats groups (pelagic habitats, sediment habitats, rock and biogenic reef habitats). In Annex A of the paper report, the UK provides an indication of which target/indicator relates to each of the biodiversity descriptors. Following this classification, all environmental targets relate to D1. D4 is covered by all species targets and targets for pelagic habitats. With regard to D6, habitat targets apply but no species targets have been proposed. The UK justifies the lack of species targets by the fact that the approach to setting targets for this Descriptor focuses on sea-floor habitats and their associated species. 

Most targets are specific and potentially measurable since threshold values and baselines have been defined. However, many threshold values are actually not specific. Many of them include terms such as “no statistically significant decrease”, others provide a method to set a threshold value rather than an actual value (e.g. The distributional range in each admin area should not decrease, with statistical significance by x% or more for inshore winter gull roosts). In terms of baselines, an analysis of these has already been done when assessing the adequacy of the GES definitions. As mentioned, baselines are defined for many targets (mostly species targets) while for others, in particular habitat targets, a reference is made to the need to use different baselines, but no reason given as to why this is necessary. In Annex A of its paper report, the UK acknowledges that a vast majority of the targets/indicators defined for biodiversity need further development and will not be operational before 2014-2018. 

All targets and most indicators are state targets/indicators. One target is defined as a pressure target, related to the risk to island birds from non-native predators, and one is defined as an impact target, related to the mortality of cetaceans due to fishing by-catch. A few additional indicators are defined as pressure indicators when they relate to the reduction of specific pressures from human activities (e.g. fishing by-catch, contaminants, non-invasive species, physical loss and damage) to ensure that these do not adversely affect species and habitats. The fishing pressure (in particular bottom trawling), which is recognized as causing major negative impacts on habitat types in the initial assessment, is not specifically addressed in the biodiversity targets but may be captured under a more general target to significantly reduce areas which are 'unsustainably impacted'. It is not addressed either by the targets defined to cover Descriptor 3. The overall paucity of specific pressure/impact targets suggests the targets will not be sufficient to achieve GES.

The UK refers to several existing frameworks in its targets. In particular, the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive are extensively used to define baselines and threshold values where applicable. OSPAR’s EcoQOs however are not directly used in the text of the targets or indicators. However in the accompanying text to the targets and indicators, the existence of the EcoQOs is mentioned. It is not clear whether this means that they should be complied with. The UK does not directly refer to other international conservation agreements either in its targets (only in the accompanying text, e.g. ASCOBANS). This is in line with the UK approach, which has chosen to identify targets in addition to those already set by existing international commitments. This could explain why certain species are not at all addressed by the targets (because they are covered by existing international agreements) but since the UK does not list these agreements, it is not clear which ones are considered relevant or how these are incorporated into an overall assessment of GES. 

In terms of gaps in coverage, no targets have been defined for cephalopods, which is in line with the lack of assessment of this group’s current status. The UK justifies this gap with the lack of information and data for these species and acknowledges that further development work may be required as targets for these species would be an important part of assessing GES under Descriptors 1 and 4. No specific plan is proposed for the collection of additional data. 

Spatial gaps in the monitoring of pelagic, deep sea and coastal fish species have also been identified, which explains why the targets proposed are based on offshore assessment of demersal species and the baselines used for all fish-related targets relate to groundfish survey. Again, the lack of targets for these species is consistent with the lack of assessment of the current status of these species. But no suggestion is provided for how the gaps will be addressed.

No targets have been set related to energy flows within food webs, which is justified by the lack of knowledge on these issues. The UK also acknowledges that further knowledge is needed on the impacts of physical loss and damage on benthic habitats and their resilience to pressure. 

Looking at the targets that are relevant for D6, the overall targets for rock and reef habitat types are geared towards the maintenance (or improvement) of a baseline status or accept a deviation of a maximum of 5% of additional areas in poor condition from the baselines. However, baselines have not been defined yet (except Favourable Reference Area for Habitats Directive habitats). The overall targets for sediment habitat type also reflect the maintenance (or improvement) of a baseline status (not defined) and possible deviation from such baseline. It also reflects an ambition to reduce habitats impacted by human activities, although it is not clear which ones. Once again however, the baseline is not defined. For sediment habitat types, WFD targets for area of unacceptable impact for benthic invertebrates, macroalgae, saltmarsh and seagrass are to be used within WFD boundaries as appropriate.";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6, assessment:

The set of targets and indicators defined by the UK for Descriptors 1, 4 and 6 is considered adequate. They are comprehensive in that they cover all the main elements of biodiversity and threshold values and baselines are specified. Some of the targets are only at an interim stage of development. Most targets are state oriented and, as such, constitute definitions of GES rather than targets to achieve GES. A few targets however address specific pressures and their impacts and thus will help ensure that GES can be met. A number of gaps have been identified in the targets. Most of them are acknowledged by the UK and are acceptable considering current state of knowledge but plans to address them are not systematically provided. ";"From Descriptor 1, 4, 6 assessment:

- Large number of specific targets
- Cover all elements of biodiversity comprehensively
- Most targets are SMART because they address specific elements and include thresholds and baselines
- Some targets are still under development
- A few targets address pressures
";3;Adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D6;Consistency ;;"The assessment of pressures and biological features is in line with the definition of GES for D1, D4 and D6 as these are quite general. 

The setting of targets is consistent with the initial assessment apart from two issues:
-	The initial assessment acknowledges that the majority of the pressure exerted on seafloor habitats comes from fishing activities (and in particular bottom trawling) but it is not addressed by targets on the impacts of the fishing pressure. As the targets for Descriptor 3 are related to commercial fish stocks, they are not directly relevant for seabed habitats. 
-	The initial assessment acknowledges that many top predators and higher trophic levels are in a depleted state; ";;;;
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has defined GES for Descriptor 7 at descriptor level. The definition is consistent with the MSFD definition and the Commission Decision, without being a simple reproduction of these. The same definition is reported in the reporting sheets and in the paper report, and is applicable to both the UK marine regions. All criteria laid out for Descriptor 7 in the Commission Decision are incorporated and it can be considered that all indicators are therefore addressed but from a very general perspective. 

The GES definition itself is merely qualitative since no threshold values or baselines have been reported in the reporting sheets or the paper report. In addition, in the GES definition, there is no explicit reference to the appropriate WFD definitions of ecological status classifications for coastal waters or to the OSPAR approach. 

In the accompanying text to the definition, the UK provides some details regarding the main categories of infrastructures that can lead to changes in hydrographical conditions. It also refers to the existing regulatory framework (and in particular the EIA and SEA Directives, the WFD, the Habitats Directive) which it considers sufficient to monitor and assess potential impacts of any significant developments. ";"The GES definition of the UK for D7 is assessed as partially adequate. GES has been defined; it is not a simple reformulation of the MSFD. However, the definition is not specific enough (“significant”, “long term”, “scale”). No threshold values or baselines have been reported. The WFD and other existing regulatory frameworks are mentioned in the accompanying text (except OSPAR) but not referred to in the definition itself. ";"- GES definition encompasses all the criteria of the Commission Decision
- Not specific enough
- Lack of thresholds
- Mention of the WFD and other regulatory frameworks";2;Partially adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"An initial assessment of the level of pressure of permanent hydrographical alterations in the North Sea and in the Celtic Seas has been carried out by the UK. Although it is stated that there are no information gaps, it is also acknowledged that the confidence in the assessment needs to be improved and that reference points need to be established. In the paper report it is stated that beyond the coastal water bodies – many of which have been designated as heavily modified water bodies under the WFD – there have not been recognized in the UK seas significant alterations of hydrographical conditions resulting from human developments, with consequent effects on marine ecosystems.

Renewable energy installations, oil and gas, ports and sand and gravel mining are indicated as the main sources of permanent hydrographical alterations and the proportion of the environment affected and of habitats and functional groups impacted is also reported. It is considered that permanent hydrographical alterations do not have a significant impact on the water column, the seabed and on functional groups, but it is not clear whether this refers to spatial extent or level of impact or both. Although the assessment of status is not made per reference to GES (i.e. achieved or not achieved) it is reported that there are few or no problems relating to the impacts on seabed and on functional groups. However, there is no mention of the status of the impact on water column and of any trends.

There is no explicit reference to OSPAR QSR 2010 but the assessment seems in any case consistent with chapter 12 for Regions II and III. Marine acidification is briefly mentioned and oil and gas installations, urban discharges, agriculture and forestry are indicated as the main sources of pressure in both regions. However it is stated that “more data are required to understand the scales of temporal and spatial variability”. ";The initial assessment of the UK for permanent hydrographical alterations is assessed as partially adequate, as there is no clear definition of how 'significant impact' is to be assessed. All relevant changes/impacts have been assessed. The level of impact is considered low, which is consistent with the changes (nature, scale) reported and with OSPAR QSR. ;"- Covers most pressures and impacts
- No mention of the status of the impact on water column and of any trends

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D7;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK has defined two targets and two associated indicators to address Descriptor 7 (in fact one target and two indicators). The target reported is the same in the reporting sheet and the paper report, but the indicators are only mentioned in the reporting sheets. The targets are applicable both to the North Sea and the Celtic Seas. The target and indicators cover the two criteria and three indicators of the Commission Decision.

The baseline to be used is specified in the reporting sheet as the current hydrographic conditions as described in the 2012 initial assessment and 2010 OSPAR QSR. The UK mentions that additional baseline information will be provided as a result of surveys carried out by industry to meet licence/consent obligations. In the reporting sheets, it is also indicated that the targets should address only large scale projects such as offshore wind farms, tidal barrages, tidal farms, offshore airports, and other significant marine infrastructures. The UK also acknowledges that there is a need to review the existing EIA and SEA regulatory framework in order to take into account cumulative impacts; it is not clear if this will incorporate existing levels of impact. 

The targets are considered to be specific, measurable, achievable and realistic, and they are sufficiently targeted to the anthropogenic pressures addressed to reducing impacts of human activities, provided they are submitted to regulation. ";The set of environmental targets and associated indicators defined by the UK for D7 is assessed as adequate. The set covers the two criteria and three indicators of the Commission Decision. They are specific, well-focused to the reduction of impacts and clearly linked to the definition of GES. Overall, the targets are sufficiently ambitious to achieve GES (through them no project or activity should prevent the achievement of GES for D7) and consistent as set (as referred above, there is actually one single target with two indicators).;"- Well-focused to the reduction of impacts and clearly linked to the definition of GES
- SMART
- Cover both criteria from the 2010 Commission Decision
- Link to existing regulatory frameworks";3;Adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D7;Consistency ;;The assessment of the pressure and its impacts is considered to be consistent with the UK definition of GES for Descriptor 7. The set of environmental targets covers all pressures and impacts identified in the initial assessment but it seems to apply only to new projects and not to existing activities. In any case, the set of targets is considered sufficient to achieve GES in relation to hydrographical alterations since the UK waters are considered to be already at GES and that any significant further degradation should be prevented through the set of targets. However, it is not clear if new developments would be assessed against components of D1, 4 and 6 in a cumulative manner, as defined in GES (e.g. scale of assessment).;;;;
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has set GES for Descriptor 8 at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. However, the definition of GES at descriptor level includes the two criteria defined for D8 in the Commission Decision: concentration of contaminants and effects of contaminants. The definition at descriptor level is not a copy of the Directive and specifies the GES definition of the Directive further by introducing the elements covered by the Decision criteria. 

In the accompanying text to the GES definition in the paper report, the UK provides an indication of the substances concerned by this definition at a general level: synthetic compounds (e.g. pesticides, antifoulants, pharmaceuticals, etc.), non-synthetic, compounds (e.g. heavy metals, hydrocarbons, etc.), and other substances considered pollutants, whether solid, liquid or gas. It does not provide an exhaustive list of the specific contaminants that are covered by the definition. As the accompanying text and the GES definition are not specific regarding the standards that are covered by the GES definition, there is some uncertainty as to which specific contaminants are covered by the GES definition. 

Concentration of contaminants
The UK definition in relation to concentration of contaminants is general and all-encompassing. By making a reference to national/ EU/ international levels (with a specific mention of RSC standards), the UK effectively includes the relevant WFD (and EQS) standards and OSPAR standards (and related substances). The definition refers to all relevant matrices for the measurement of concentrations of contaminants but does not specify which method or standard should be used for which matrix. No reference is made of compatibility with WFD measurement method. In the accompanying text to the definition in the paper report, the UK mentions the well-developed body of legislation already in place to control pollution from contaminants, including monitoring programmes. It does not specify what this legislation entails at national level but refers to the EQS Directive and mentions its on-going revision. It also refers to the WFD and OSPAR monitoring programmes. A second condition has been added by the UK that differs from the Commission Decision Indicator 8.1.1:  GES is achieved if concentrations of contaminants are kept within agreed levels and if the concentrations are not increasing. The addition of this condition makes the UK definition more stringent than the Commission Decision as concentrations that already are within agreed levels should not be increasing, even if they remain below the thresholds. However, no baseline is provided in the paper report or the reporting sheet against which such trend can be monitored. No specific threshold values are provided in the paper report or the reporting sheet but it can be inferred that the threshold values are the agreed levels mentioned by the UK in its definition, although it is not clear which standards (WFD or RSC) apply. 

Effects of contaminants
The UK definition in relation to effects of contaminants reflects the Commission Decision Indicator 8.2.1 and specifies it further by making reference to agreed levels at national/ EU/ international levels (with a specific mention of RSC standards). As for the first part of the definition on concentration of contaminants, this is all-encompassing and effectively includes relevant standards such as OSPAR EcoQOs. If so, this should also include effects on ecosystem components of pollution from acute events (e.g. oil pollution). However, it is not possible to say whether this is the case since the UK does not specify which standards are included in the definition and does not explicitly refers to acute pollution. In any case, Indicator 8.2.2 from the Commission Decision on the occurrence, origin and extent of acute pollution events is not reflected in the UK definition. Once again, no threshold values or baselines are reported by the UK, which means that it is not clear which national and international standards are covered by the definition. It is also not specified which ecosystem components are covered by the GES definition (or are actually relevant for the UK) within the group of “selected biological processes and taxonomic groups, where a cause/effect relationship has been established”.  The accompanying text to the GES definition does not include any specific details about effects of contaminants. 

As mentioned above, the UK makes regular reference to national/ EU/ international levels (with a specific mention of RSC standards). However, it does not specify any hierarchy between those different requirements or whether certain standards are applied to particular contaminants. ";The UK approach is considered partially adequate. GES is defined at criteria level and refers to EU and RSC standards but only at a general level. While it can be inferred that this covers the relevant WFD/EQS and OSPAR standards, the lack of specificity makes it difficult to properly assess. The GES definition covers two Commission Decision indicators out of three. Acute pollution events can be considered partly covered but only from an impact point of view. The occurrence, origin and extent of acute pollution episodes (indicator 8.2.2) are not covered by the UK definition of GES. The definition of the UK with regard to concentrations of contaminants is more stringent than the Commission Decision criterion as it includes a condition that concentrations of contaminants should not increase even if they are below regulatory levels. This could be considered a good practice except that there is no specification of baseline, which makes this condition difficult to assess. The UK approach might meet the minimum requirements but this cannot be fully stated considering the lack of specification with regard to the actual standards to be used to assess achievement of GES, the contaminants and ecosystem components covered and the baseline to be used to measure trends in concentrations. ;"- GES definition covers both criteria of the Commission Decision
- General reference to EU and RSC standards but lack of specificity (“agreed levels”)
- Uncertainty regarding substances/biological effects covered
- Not full coverage of indicator 8.2.2 on acute pollution events
- Potential good practice (“not increasing”) but lack of baseline";2;Partially adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK provides a single assessment of contamination of its marine waters by hazardous substances, which includes details where relevant for the North Sea waters and the Celtic Seas waters. The level of details and the approaches used to make the assessment on the level of, and impacts from, contamination are similar for the two marine subregions. Therefore, the assessment of adequacy has been grouped for the two subregions. 

Synthetic and non-synthetic substances
The assessment done by the UK on contamination of their marine waters by hazardous substances is in general well-detailed, quantitative and specific. It focuses on the metals cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) (identified by the OSPAR Commission as Chemicals for Priority Action in the North-East Atlantic region) and on a number of synthetic substances including PCBs, PAHs, TBT and lindane. The UK provides a detailed account of the various sources of contamination and the main activities responsible (industry and shipping) and provides quantitative data on input loads from land- and air-based sources and quantitative trends input loads from sea-based sources. 

With regard to the level of contamination in the environment, the UK provides an account of the chemical status of its water bodies on the basis of WFD data from 2009 and of monitoring data in mussels and oysters. While the account is quite detailed and covers various areas of the North Sea and Celtic Seas subregions, the assessment is localized and often limited to transitional and coastal areas. The UK acknowledges that no overall subregional assessment is possible. For non-synthetic substances, the UK mentions however that monitoring has been designed to focus on problem areas (mainly coastal). Some expert judgement is provided, which extrapolates on the status of offshore waters. The level of contamination in functional groups has been assessed on the basis of data in fish and harbour porpoise (only for synthetic substances). 

Clear reference is made to relevant EU standards and to assessments made under various EU processes (WFD, Shellfish Directive, Dangerous Substance Directive). The UK even refers to the upcoming review of the EQS Directive and the changes this will lead to in the assessment of the contamination status of certain sites. The UK also often refers to OSPAR procedures, to the 2010 Quality Status Report. The main activities causing the pressure are provided. 

The assessment of the impacts on ecosystem components from contamination is less quantified. In particular for non-synthetic substances, the UK has not assessed impacts on seabed and functional groups. The UK justifies that methods to assess the impacts on habitats and functional groups are not available. For synthetic substances, the assessment of impacts on seabed habitats/biota is relatively limited and only qualitative. The assessment of impacts on functional groups is more specific but done only for one functional group (harbour porpoise). In any case, the UK provides in its paper report a summary of the main results of the analysis of a number of biological effects from its Charting Progress 2 report. The effects considered include among others exposure to planar organic contaminants, carcinogenic exposure, fish liver pathologies, disrupted endocrine functions, development of male characteristics in female dogwhelks.

The UK has made a number of judgements on the level of the contamination pressure and its impacts but never in relation to GES. The judgements state that there are some, few or no problems in the area considered with regard to the level of the pressure and its impact. A trend is often provided. In order to makes its judgement, the UK has used OSPAR’s assessment criteria (EU maximum food limit values) for heavy metals and PAHs and PCBs and OSPAR’s provisional assessment criteria for TBT but has not used the EU EQS. In the section on the definition of the GES characteristics of the paper report, the UK provides a summary of the current status with regard to contamination by hazardous substances. While still not conclusive about the status in relation to GES (i.e. current status is good or not), the UK acknowledges that concentrations of monitored substances are still above levels where there is a risk of pollution effects in many coastal areas, especially where there have been historical discharges, emissions and losses from high population densities or heavy industry.

Finally, the UK provides a summary of the main knowledge gaps (e.g. challenges in developing summary information groups of hazardous substances collectively, assessment of sea-based inputs, etc.) and the high-level plans to address these. 

Radionuclides
An assessment of contamination by radionuclides has been carried out, mentioning the relevant sources of contamination but with limited quantitative information for input loads. The substances assessed are listed (radium-226, radium-228, lead-210, iodine-131 and caesium-137). The level of contamination by radionuclides in the environment and in functional groups is assessed, albeit qualitatively (trends are provided), in various geographic areas. The assessment of impacts only provides the conclusion of what seems to be a more in-depth study carried out by national institutions and does not give details on the ecosystem components (seabed habitats or functional groups) actually assessed.  The conclusion is made in reference to the threshold value of 40 µGy/hr, which the UK explains to represent the difference between exposure from natural sources (estimated at 60 µGy/hr) and the 100 µGy/hr level below which no adverse effects are expected to occur. 

In terms of judgement on the level of, and impact from, contamination by radionuclides, as for other hazardous substances, the UK is not concluding on this in relation to GES and simply refers to some, few or no problems. The threshold value used is that of 40 µGy/hr for pressure on ecosystem components. For the level of contamination in the environment, the judgement (few or no problems) has been made on the basis of expert judgement. 

The main activities causing the pressure are identified. No reference is made to OSPAR’s assessment of levels of contamination or OSPAR’s strategic objective with regard to radioactive substances but the UK does refer to the work undertaken in OSPAR to examine the uncertainties regarding the effects from offshore sources. 

Acute pollution events
With regard to oil pollution, the UK provides a short but specific, and quantified, description of accidental discharges and oil spills with some qualitative and quantitative trends. The assessment of impacts on ecosystem components is limited. The main activities causing the pressure are reported but no judgement is made regarding the current level of, and impact from, the pressure. The trend in status, however, is described as stable. It is not certain on which basis this is assessed. No information is provided regarding future plans to address the gaps in the assessment.  

It should be noted that in the reporting sheet for the Celtic Seas, it appears that the UK has reported information related to hydrographical processes instead of contamination from acute pollution. ";The initial assessment of contamination of the UK marine waters by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events is considered adequate. The UK provides a detailed account of the sources of pollution, quantified information on input loads, quantitative or qualitative trends. It refers to relevant EU and OSPAR standards (except for radionuclides). The assessment of impacts and biological effects is less quantified but supported by underlining in-depth analysis. The UK has not made a conclusive judgement on the level of, and impacts from, the pressure in relation to GES but has provided an indication of current status in relation to OSPAR standards. ;"- Covers all sources of pollution
- Quantified information on input loads and concentration of contaminants in the environment
- More qualitative description of impacts on ecosystem components but underlining in-depth analysis
- Assessment of current status in relation to OSPAR standards but no conclusive judgement (good/not good)";3;Adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D8;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK has defined three targets to address Descriptor 8, each associated with one indicator. The targets reported are the same in the paper report and the reporting sheet but the indicators are reported only in the reporting sheets. The three targets cover all aspects of Descriptor 8 (concentration and effects of contaminants and acute pollution event) except contamination by radionuclides, which is expected at this stage provided GES is already achieved. 

Two targets and associated indicators are measurable and can be considered as SMART. Threshold values are not directly specified but through reference to the WFD’s EQS or OSPAR’s EAC or EcoQOs. Baselines are specified in relation to OSPAR’s BAC. The UK has not defined a target, which relates to the second condition of the GES definition (concentrations of contaminants should not increase). It is interesting to note that the indicator associated with the first target – concentration of contaminants – requires concentrations to be measured in sediment and biota but not in water. This would imply that a number of EQS are not relevant for this target as they can only be measured in water.

For the targets related to the effects of contaminants, these can also be considered SMART since the UK refers to the relevant biological effects agreed within OSPAR “as appropriate for MSFD purposes” and to the ICES/OSPAR’s Background Response Levels for the baseline. However, it is not specified exactly which biological effects this target covers. 

Target 3 is not as specific but as it is the operational target defined within OSPAR, it is relevant for the UK to have adopted it and should ensure a certain level of coherence with other OSPAR countries. Despite the specification of a baseline (pre-existing levels of contamination and biological effects observed prior to the incident if available), the lack of threshold value or quantitative trend in the definition makes the target and associated indicators not measurable.

No target has been defined focusing on controlling human activities. In the paper report, the UK explains that measures taken under existing processes (such as the UWWTD, the IPPC Directive, REACH, etc.), which specifically target human activities, should be enough to achieve GES, with the exception of a few problem areas. The UK mentions that the costs of taking measures specifically for these problem areas would be too disproportionate to be justified. The UK refers to the impact assessment on the implementation of the MSFD made in 2012. No specification is provided regarding where these areas which might not achieve GES are located and how extensive they are. It is not clear for instance how these areas relate to the conclusion on the current status that “there is a risk of pollution effects in many coastal areas”. ";The set of targets defined by the UK to cover Descriptor 8 is considered as partially adequate. It is measurable and quantified except for one target on acute pollution. It refers to the relevant EU and OSPAR standards and is time-bound. However, the set of targets is not sufficient to achieve GES as GES includes a condition that concentrations of contaminants should not increase and there is no targets related to this aspect.  In relation to target 1, some EQS substances are not covered by the associated indicator. The approach to the control of human activities is pragmatic although it may be considered as lacking ambition since it leaves open the possibility for certain problem areas (where these occur is not defined) not to achieve GES. More generally, the target defined for effects of contaminants is not specific enough to assess its level of ambition. ;"- Targets and associated indicators are SMART because they refer to standards
- No inclusion of concentration levels in water (only sediment and biota) which excludes a number of substances
- Pragmatic approach to the control of human activities but leaves possibility for problem areas not to reach GES";2;Partially adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D8;Consistency ;;"The assessment of pressure from contamination by hazardous substances is consistent with the definition of GES as it uses the same standards (WFD, OSPAR). However the assessment of effects on ecosystem components from contamination has not focused specifically on the effects targeted by OSPAR’s EcoQOs (e.g. imposex in sea snails or oiled guillemots).  

The targets are also consistent with the assessment of pressure and impacts, although none relate to radioactive substances, which is expected at this stage. The targets however are not fully consistent with the GES definition in relation to the concentrations of contaminants. No target is defined to ensure that concentrations do not increase (and subsequently no baseline is defined in the targets or the GES against which such increase could be measured). ";;;;
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has set GES for Descriptor 9 only at descriptor level in both the reporting sheets and the paper report. Criterion 9.1 defined in the Commission Decision is reflected in the GES definition of the UK. 

It should be noted that in the paper report, a footnote has been added to the GES definition which adds an exception for fish liver, “for which a high rate of non-compliance is expected”.

The definition of GES makes a clear reference to EU regulation 1881/2006 (as amended) and refers to other relevant standards but does not provide any information on what these are. In the accompanying text, a reference is made to existing EU legislation or other internationally and nationally agreed standards but again with no further specification of what this entails. 

As there is no specific detail on which fish or seafood is covered by the definition of GES, it is assumed that it covers all fish and seafood caught or harvested for human consumption. The UK has not included a list of the contaminants that are addressed by the GES definition but refers to organic chemicals and trace metals as specifically relevant. Because of the addition of “other relevant standards” in the GES definition, it cannot be extrapolated that the contaminants covered in the GES definition are only those included in Regulation 1881/2006. 

As for D8, the UK adds a condition which is stricter than what is proposed by the Commission Decision. Concentrations of contaminants should not exceed regulatory levels and should not increase. This would suggest that concentrations should not increase even if they remain below regulatory levels. However, no baseline is specified against which such potential increase (or lack thereof) could be measured. 

In its accompanying text to the GES definition in the paper report, the UK mentions that biotoxins and microbiological contamination were not addressed under D9 or under any other descriptor. The UK provides a justification for not including biotoxins, based on ICES/JRC Task Group 9 report, but does not provide a similar justification for microbial pathogens. ";The definition of GES for Descriptor 9 is considered as partially adequate. GES is defined only at the descriptor level and reflects partly the Commission Decision criterion 9.1 as it covers only indicator 9.1.1 on the concentration of contaminants but does not cover indicator 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded. The GES definition directly refers to the relevant EU legislation but also refers to other relevant standards with no specification of what these might be. It is therefore not clear which substances are covered by the GES definition. The GES definition is measurable and specific as far as compliance with Regulation 1881/2006 in concerned but not for other standards. The addition of a more stringent condition to keep concentrations stable (i.e. not increasing) would be considered a good practice if a baseline was defined. Without a baseline, it is effectively useless. Finally, the addition of a footnote excluding fish liver from the scope of the GES definition should be regarded as a gap. In particular, no specific plan is mentioned on how to address this particular issue or what the justification is. ;"- GES definition covers criterion 9.1 only partly, no mention of frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded
- Reference to relevant standard (Regulation 1881/2006) but no specification of what “other standards” are
 - Exclusion of fish liver from the scope of the definition
- Potential good practice (“not increasing”) but lack of baseline";2;Partially adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK reports the same information for both subregions with regard to contamination of fish and seafood. The reason for this is because monitoring of concentration of contaminants in fish and seafood has been done in the UK on the basis of surveys carried out in retail outlets directly, which makes it difficult to know which marine waters the results of the surveys apply to and hence where the stocks come from. In general, the surveys conclude that regulatory levels as specified in Regulation 1881/2006 are rarely exceeded. 

With regard to radioactive substances, the UK reports that radiation exposure around nuclear licensed sites remains low however this assessment does not specifically relate to contamination of fish and seafood.  

The main activities causing the pressure are the same as the same as those reported for contamination by hazardous substances in general. No judgement has been made on the current level of contamination in fish and seafood in relation to GES but in the accompanying text to the GES definition, the UK concludes that very few non-compliant samples have been reported and that contaminant levels are generally acceptable (i.e. maximum regulatory levels are not exceeded). 

Microbial pathogens

The UK has made an assessment for the level of pressure and impacts related to microbial pathogens, in relation to bathing and shellfish waters in UK waters. The level of details in the reporting of the pressure is the same for the two subregions even if some specific information is mentioned for one or the other subregion. The assessment includes quantified trends. The UK assesses the levels of contamination by microbial pathogens against both the Bathing Water and the Shellfish Water Directives however it does not make a judgement in relation to GES, which is in line with the fact that it has not defined GES criteria in relation to microbial pathogens. ";The initial assessment of the contamination by hazardous substances of fish and other seafood (including by microbial pathogens) is considered partially adequate. The UK provides limited information and no details on the substances monitored and the seafood targeted by the sampling surveys. The UK acknowledges the gaps in its assessment methodology (monitoring carried out only for human consumption purposes, this does not deal with the source of the seafood) but does not provide plans to address these gaps. Reference to the relevant legislation is made. No conclusive judgement is made but it can be inferred and is indirectly related to the GES definition for D9.;"- Limited information and no details about substances covered
- Acknowledgment of gaps (including problem of origin of the samples monitored) but no mention of plans to remedy the gaps

United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D9;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK has defined one target and one associated indicator to address Descriptor 9. The targets reported are the same in the paper report and the reporting sheet but the indicators are reported only in the reporting sheets. The target defined makes reference to regulatory levels, without specifying further what these are. From the initial assessment and the GES, it can be inferred that this refers to Regulation 1881/2006 and “other relevant standards” but the target does not provide more detail on what these other standards might be. 

The target and indicator are not specific with regard to the contaminants and seafood covered. For contaminants, the target specifies “where regulatory levels have been set” so it can be inferred that it includes substances covered by Regulation 1881/2006. Other substances might be included that are covered by other international, EU or national legislation but this is not specified. 

The threshold value set for the achievement of the target, “high rate of compliance”, is not specific. No further details have been provided in the paper report or the reporting sheet regarding what this entails. It is also not specified the share of samples that should originate from commercial fishing grounds or other areas where seafood is harvested. The target is not considered SMART. It is time-bound, achievable and realistic (considering that it is quite vague) but lacks specific details to be considered fully measurable. The UK mentions that further development is needed for this target in order to make it fully operational by 2018.

The target does not cover indicator 9.1.2 on the frequency of regulatory levels being exceeded, which is in line with the GES definition. In the accompanying text to the targets, the UK acknowledges this but considers that this aspect is adequately covered by the target as it is.   

Finally, the target and indicator do not address the second condition added by the UK in their GES definition that concentration of contaminants should not be increasing. ";The set of target and indicator defined by the UK to cover Descriptor 9 is considered partially adequate. While the target/indicator are potentially measurable through their reference to regulatory levels, the lack of specificity of the threshold value means that it is not possible to actually assess the achievement of the target. In addition to this lack of specificity, the target and indicator are not sufficient to achieve GES since GES includes a condition that concentrations of contaminants should not be increasing. This is not addressed by the current set of target/indicator defined by the UK. ;"- Target potentially measurable but not fully SMART because lack threshold value
- No target related to non-increase of concentrations";2;Partially adequate
United Kingdom (North East Atlantic);D9;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the impacts of contamination by hazardous substances on fish and seafood is consistent with the definition of GES in that it focuses solely on the concentration of contaminants and refers to the same regulatory levels. 

The set of target and indicator is consistent with the initial assessment. The IA concludes that the current monitoring methodology (for human consumption rather than for environmental purposes) is not adequate to determine where the sample was taken from. On this basis, the target includes in the surveys to be used to monitor contaminant levels “samples originating from commercial fishing grounds” but does not refer to other areas of harvesting of seafood. 

The set of target and indicator is consistent with the definition of GES with one notable exception that it does not include a reference to the condition specified in the GES definition that concentrations of contaminants should not increase. ";;;;
United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D1;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK defined GES for Descriptor 1 for its Western Mediterranean region at criteria level integrating components of the Descriptor as provided in Annex I of the MSFD into the different criteria. 

The GES definition refers to habitats and species in general, to those that are defined as rare or threatened under existing national or international agreements and to key ecosystems. It does not refer to specific species or species groups (e.g. porpoises, marine mammals). Furthermore it is not clarified what constitutes a key ecosystem. 

The baseline used for the GES definition is defined in the sense of “reference conditions”, i.e. in line with prevailing environmental conditions but it also integrates the concept of sustainable use and allows for a certain level of further environmental degradation (e.g. it requires no significant reduction). However, the UK also refers to maintaining biodiversity and restoring key ecosystems. 

In general the GES definition remains rather nonspecific and it is not clear what is required in order to achieve GES aside from requirements already existent in other legislation. In several cases the word “significant” is used although it is not clarified what can be understood as significant. ";The definition of GES by the UK for Descriptor 1 for the Western Mediterranean region is assessed partially adequate. GES has been defined for all criteria of the Commission Decision although they do not correspond directly to those provided in the Commission Decision.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D1;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"Biological features:

Species/functional groups
The UK has reported at species group level but also refers to some individual species. The assessment is only qualitative and covers benthic invertebrates, fish, cetaceans and reptiles, phytoplankton, algae and seabirds. For each of the groups the report indicates, even though without much detail, the key pressures, a description of status and trends, a list of the main species, the predicted status in 2020-2030 in a business-as-usual situation, and the knowledge gaps and measures to tackle these. The species listed under the Habitats Directive or the Birds Directive are also indicated and it is noted that the status of these are reported in line with the requirements of these Directives. For some specific species the status is indicated in the report e.g. the population of the Mediterranean shag is considered stable while the population of Pinna nobilis has gone through a “serious decline” in recent years.


Habitat types
The UK has undertaken an initial assessment of its habitats. The assessment is purely qualitative and covers the main seabed habitats: intertidal habitats, rocky shoreline, sandy habitats, sea caves, subtidal habitats, reefs and artificial reefs. For each type of habitat a very short description is provided, including in some cases, the main species present. The main causes of pressure are referred to, including pollution, fishing and physical damage. No indication is given as to which habitats affected are affected by the specific pressure. The report states that the ‘conservation status of the marine habitats is expected to remain stable or decrease between now and 2020’. For submerged or partially submerged sea caves and reefs the report states that ‘the current and future status of the reefs is deemed favourable if the relevant management measures continue to be implemented.’ The current status for these habitats is classified as stable. Finally reference is made to the Habitats Directive.

Ecosystems
The UK has not reported on ecosystems for the Mediterranean.";"The initial assessment by the UK of the biological features of its marine waters is considered partially adequate. The assessment is mostly descriptive and not very detailed. It covers only seabed habitats; it refers to the main species for each habitat and includes qualitative judgements for some of the habitats.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D1;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK has proposed seven targets and ten associated indicators to cover its Western Mediterranean waters for biodiversity. The targets are split into three categories: marine mammals, seabirds and fish. 

In the accompanying text, the UK indicates that, for benthic habitats, the measures taken under the Habitats Directive, the WFD and the Gibraltar Biodiversity Action Plan are sufficient to achieve GES. The UK also stated that BOPA monitoring (mostly used under the WFD to measure eutrophication in benthic species) currently indicates that all benthic habitats are at GES. The measures under the WFD are also indicated to be sufficient to achieve GES for water column habitats. 

The targets defined specifically for the MSFD therefore all relate to the three species groups. The defined targets include both state and pressure targets but remain quite general. The targets do not address specific species except the Mediterranean Shag. In the accompanying text, the UK indicates that more specific thresholds need to be set for these species. The targets also state that various species components should not be significantly impacted or that a significant proportion of a population should meet individual targets. It is however not clarified what constitutes a significant impact or proportion. 

The targets indicate that cetacean populations should remain stable, seabird populations should be maintained in good condition and sensitive fish populations should be recovered. The achievability of target stating that fish species distribution, population size and community composition are not significantly impacted by human activities is uncertain, depending on what is considered by significant. 

In relation to the pressure targets for both cetaceans and fish it is stated that human impacts should not be significant in a general way, only for seabirds are some human pressures defined more specifically (e.g. accidental capture, oiling).";The targets defined by the UK for biodiversity in the Western Mediterranean region are considered partially adequate. The targets address three species groups and do not refer to specific species except for the Mediterranean Shag. There are no clearly defined thresholds. Most pressures are referred to in general as human activities with the exception of by-catch which is referred to for several targets. For benthic and water column habitats, it is stated in the accompanying text that GES will be achieved due to measures implemented under other legislation. However, the UK could have defined targets stating that the objectives for those pieces of legislation should be achieved by 2020.;"- Targets address 3 species groups but not benthic habitats

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D10;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has defined GES for D10 the same way for both marine regions (North East Atlantic and Western Mediterranean). The UK has provided a definition that consists of various components of the descriptor and indicators as provided in the 2010 Commission Decision. 

The GES definition sets two broadly defined conditions for the achievement of GES: 1) litter and its degradation products decreases over time and 2) levels do not pose a significant risk to the coastal and marine environment. The GES definition however does not specify the level of reduction required (threshold value). The UK GES definition does not distinguish between the floating litter, water column and seabed. Micro-particles are only implicitly and partly included as part of litter degradation products.  

Regarding the level of impact it is not clear what is considered a “significant” risk to the coastal and marine environment. Entanglement is reported as a direct cause of mortality. Bio-accumulation and reduced fecundity is considered as an indirect impact and could refer implicitly to the ingestion of plastic particles. ";The GES definition for D10 by the UK is partially adequate. The GES definition has been defined broadly at the descriptor level, but integrates elements of the criteria and indicators. The GES definition is specific with regard to the impacts (direct and indirect) that should be reduced and it includes an objective that marine litter in the environment is reduced over time. This implies that the baseline is the current status, but it is not clearly stated. In addition, the GES definition does not provide clear threshold values. This means that it is not clear how this reduction should be achieved. ;- The GES provided is the same as that provided for NEA waters. See the assessment results in table above;2;Partially adequate
United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D10;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The assessment by the UK of contamination by marine litter in its Western Mediterranean waters is essentially descriptive. Beach recreation, trans-boundary sources (e.g. shipping, fishing, off-shore industries) and recreational fishing are identified as main sources of litter in Gibraltar. 

At two locations, high densities of beach litter are observed. Yet no quantitative data is provided. Impacts of marine litter on marine life are referred to but not further described specifically for Gibraltar. It is also briefly mentioned that marine litter has an economic impact on tourism without further specification. No trends or status judgements are provided. 

The UK reports that a need exist to on the long term to develop the understanding of the types and amounts of marine litter.";The UK initial assessment of marine litter for its Western Mediterranean waters is considered inadequate.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D10;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);The UK has proposed the GES definition for D10 as the target for marine litter for its Gibraltar waters. In addition, the UK reports that more explicit and quantitative targets could not be defined due to the lack of knowledge on marine litter. In short term, the UK plans a socio-economic analysis as a means to assess the cost-effectiveness of measures. It is unclear how the latter links to the setting of targets.

The report does not contain any targets although the text does state that there are targets, it might be inferred that part of the GES definition referring to litter levels reducing over time is considered a target. With the data presented in the initial assessment it will be impossible to assess GES. ";;;;
United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D11;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has defined GES for D11 for its Western Mediterranean waters at criteria level providing a definition that is close to that provided for other UK waters but omitting certain parts. 

The GES definition covers both impulsive and continuous forms of noise. The definition contains some vagueness as to which marine species will be used to assess whether GES is achieved since impacts should be assessed 'at the population level or specifically to vulnerable/threatened species and key functional groups'. The logic for the selection of species is not clear: why is 'or' inserted, why is 'vulnerable' used instead of sensitive and what constitutes 'key' groups? 

In relation to continuous low frequency sound it is clear that the assessment will be made at the population level although for which species is not specified. 

In the accompanying text, the UK lists the data and development needs in relation to Descriptor 11, referring to the development of a noise registry and a more comprehensive ambient noise monitoring programme. ";The GES definition for Descriptor 11 is considered adequate. The UK definition has integrated the criteria from the Commission Decision and provides an indication of the scale at which this descriptor will be assessed. The GES definition does still lack some clarity in how significant effects or risks are assessed and to which species it applies but this can be explained by the current level of knowledge or lack thereof.;"- Definition integrates the Criteria of the Commission Decision

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D11;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);The UK assessment for Gibraltar waters is brief but outlines several key points. The assessment justifiable identifies that shipping will be the highest pressure and provides relevant information in relation to this topic. Much of this data seems to come from the OSPAR 2009 report although this is not specifically referred to. The assessment also refers to a number of sound sensitive species in the area that are potentially affected by noise pollution. The assessment however does not provide any data on trends or measurement data coming from Gibraltar waters. ;The initial assessment is considered as partially adequate. The report remains largely generic due to the large amount of information gaps but it relates the available data to Gibraltar waters.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D2;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has defined GES for Gibraltar waters in a way that does not correspond to the Descriptor 2 text in Annex I of the MSFD or to the Commission Decision. 

The GES definition is focused on managing the risk of new NIS introductions but is not state based and only targets new species which may have an adverse impact. The GES definition as it is defined sill allows for potential new introductions of NIS. It also states that the status assessment for the achievement of GES will be based on specific assessments further implying that the GES definition itself does not contain any measurable attributes and that those will not be defined more specifically within the GES definition at a future point in time. 

The second part of the definition covers concrete measures aimed at key high risk marine NIS. This would rather constitute a target than being part of GES definition. 

Lastly the GES definition is defined only to address NIS introductions and not their state or impacts in the Gibraltar Marine waters. However, this might be included in the specific action plans but the additional texts do not imply that this is the case.  ";The GES definition for D2 is considered as partially adequate. The criteria of the Commission Decision are not used and this without justification. The whole GES definition takes a risk-based approach and, consequently, does not aim at ‘no new introductions’ but rather a reduction of the risk.

Finally GES is defined in very general terms and by itself does not contain any measurable attributes.;"- GES definition does not cover the Commission Decision criteria

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D2;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK assessment for its Western Mediterranean waters is very brief and underlines that there is currently insufficient information available to properly asses the current status of NIS in Gibraltar waters. There is little mention of the origin, vectors and pathways of introduction, location and population status. Ships and ballast water as well as aquaculture and the release of unwanted pets are indicated as pathways of NIS introductions. Marine transport is considered as the main anthropogenic activity contributing to the introduction of NIS, along with aquarium trade. 

The initial assessment makes reference to a 2010 inventory of NIS in the Western Mediterranean sub-region which includes Gibraltar. The initial assessment provides the number of NIS in 7 categories and indicates that 298 NIS species have been found although the specific species are not named. The report also notes an increasing trend in temperature rising. Finally, there is no indication on impacts justified by the lack of specific data on the population dynamics and ecology of non-indigenous marine species occurring in Gibraltar waters. One specific NIS species has been referred to, the marine algae Asparagopsis armata, as it was found to be prevalent during intertidal ecology research. In the introduction to the section on GES and targets, another species is mentioned – Caulerpa taxifolia – as being introduced through aquarium trade and incidentally making its way to the Straits of Gibraltar. It is also mentioned that NIS are monitored by the Department of Environment under the Marine Surveillance Monitoring Programme so it is unclear why none of their data is used in the Gibraltar initial assessment.";The initial assessment for the pressure “introduction of non-indigenous species” is considered inadequate.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D2;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The first target is a pressure/measure target. It is relatively specific as it defines how the risks will be reduced i.e. through improved management of high risk pathways and vectors. However, it is not measurable as there is no baseline justified by the lack of adequate historical monitoring data. Given the lack of specification, it is not possible to judge if this is achievable and realistic. There is no indication of a timeframe.

Combined with the vague definitions of GES, there is no quantification, thresholds, reference conditions and baseline. No specification is given as to how to reduce the risk, to which levels and which specific sectors or pathways to address, although the latter can be implied through reference to the initial assessment (maritime transport and aquarium trade).  The definition of GES itself recognises that there is a need to first assess high risk areas and known pathways/vectors. This more specific measure is not reflected in the targets.
 
The second target is not very specific. There is no indication as to which key high-risk NIS should be targeted and as to implementation of the plans. Besides, it is not clear whether it relates to introduction or controls. It is realistic and measurable although in a limited way given the lack of specification regarding the content of the action plans. Besides, there is no baseline justified by the lack of adequate historical monitoring data. Finally, there is no indication of a timeline.

This target is not ambitious enough to reduce the pressure or impact to levels that will achieve GES. The ’putting in place’ of management plans is quite easy but there is no time frame and the implementation and execution of the plans should also be part of the target. It is not specific enough to judge on its level of ambition. The target does not cover specific sources of new introductions.

For both targets, there is no associated indicator.";This set of two general targets is considered as inadequate to achieve GES, which is itself defined in a rather vague way.

In the accompanying text, the UK indicates that, for benthic habitats, the measures taken under the Habitats Directive, the WFD and the Gibraltar Biodiversity Action Plan are sufficient to achieve GES.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D5;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has defined GES for Descriptor 5 at descriptor, criteria and indicator level for its Western Mediterranean waters. The definition is in line with the definition in Annex I of the MSFD and covers all the criteria laid out for Descriptor 5 in the Commission Decision 2010/477 (nutrient concentrations, direct effects and indirect effects). It is not completely clear whether the indicators proposed are in fact indicators or  targets to achieve GES. 

No thresholds are presented; instead, it is stated that there should be little or no increase in abundance/biomass of indicator species, implying that GES for Descriptor 5 is currently being achieved. This appears to be a reasonable assumption, since it is stated that 	“there are very few potential eutrophication problem areas in BGTW at present” and that the existing levels of chlorophyll-a indicate “a high ecological status at all sites sampled”, albeit without any quantification.

All of the species recognised as indicators of eutrophication are benthic invertebrates, with no reference to phytoplankton taxa/chlorophyll levels or macroalgal/seagrass criteria. The initial assessment states that “at present, there is no evidence to suggest that [macro]algal communities are unhealthy. The presence of the bioindicator C. Mediterranea in parts of the Southern Waters of Gibraltar suggests that water quality is typically good.” Nevertheless, the proposed indicators represent only one of the three stated characteristics of eutrophication (reduced oxygen concentrations as a consequence of organic enrichment), and no direct effects or nutrient levels/ratios themselves are covered.

Monthly monitoring of chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate is undertaken for the Water Framework Directive, but the situation with regard to water clarity (suspended solids are monitored) and shifts in floristic composition remains unclear. Indicators are therefore available for most eutrophication criteria of  the Commission Decision 2010/477, for coastal waters at least, but it is not clear whether there is an intention to use them for MSFD reporting purposes.

The Gibraltar report states that implementation the Water Framework Directive will enable Descriptors 5 to be addressed, but provides very limited further detail. The assumption is that MSFD and WFD normative definitions of ecological status classifications will match each other for coastal waters at least, but no information on threshold levels is provided.

The UNEP/MAP approach to improving the quality of the Mediterranean is mentioned, but only briefly.";The GES definition of Gibraltar for D5 is assessed as inadequate. The GES definition is in line with the MSFD and it covers all the criteria. However the use of the indicator species to judge the proposed ‘characteristics’ of GES for Descriptor 5 is unclear.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D5;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK has undertaken an initial assessment for Gibraltar waters that considers pressures in terms of sources, but it is entirely qualitative. The assessment fails to distinguish between different sources (Nitrogen and Phosphorus), and while organic loading is inferred, it is only rarely considered in its own right. Impacts are considered negligible in the light of high dissolved oxygen levels in marine waters and high natural dispersion/flushing rates of most relevant marine waters. Some sources/pressures are covered, e.g. direct discharges and upwelling from deeper waters, but others are not, e.g. atmospheric deposition and groundwater inputs. It is stated that there are limited sources that would contribute to eutrophication, with the only major sources of additional nutrients being the point sources and overflows of sewage. Potential Gibraltar-derived nutrient contributions to adjacent marine waters are considered, as are nutrient inputs to Gibraltar waters from nearby Spanish population centres, however, all loads are considered only qualitatively. As such there is no attempted nutrient or organic matter source apportionment. 

Eutrophication impacts are not considered individually, but to some extent this lack of information is understandable given the assumption that all Gibraltar marine waters are currently in good environmental status and are expected to remain so until 2020 at least (by reference to the WFD reports). Based on current knowledge the impact(s) of the pressure appear to be negligible, although improved monitoring of macrophytobenthos would be beneficial. ";The UK initial assessment of Gibraltar waters for eutrophication is assessed as inadequate. The initial assessment is only qualitative and no parameter is quantified.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D5;Consistency ;;"The assessment of the pressures and their impacts are not entirely consistent with the UK determination of GES for Gibraltar waters. Not all pressures and impacts are considered in the Initial Assessment, which represents a very simplified qualitative overview of eutrophication only. The lack of quantitative data in the UK Gibraltar report makes it effectively impossible to determine when GES has been achieved, but the overlying assumption is that GES is currently being achieved, in part because of the high natural dispersion/flushing of most relevant marine waters.

No environmental targets are reported per se, and it is not clear what the role of the indicators reported really is. It is not clear if these indicators  represent a ‘no deterioration’ clause under the assumption that GES is already achieved. The indicators cover the only impact of eutrophication discussed in the initial assessment - organic enrichment and a subsequent reduction in dissolved oxygen levels.";;;;
United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D6;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"Similarly to D1 and D4, the GES definition for Descriptor 6 in the Mediterranean region is set at descriptor and, partially, criteria level. None of the indicators of the Commission Decision are used in the definition. 

The definition remains at a high level, referring to sea-floor habitats in general with no reference to specific habitat types. The text is generally a slightly expanded version of that found for Descriptor 6 in Annex I to the MSFD. Criterion 6.1 is partially covered although biogenic substrate are not mentioned and there is no indication of the extent of the seabed that should be protected from human activities. The last statement in the definition potentially alludes to setting up protected areas for particularly vulnerable sea-floor habitats, but this is not entirely clear as protection can also be provided through other means.

For each type of habitat a very short description is provided, including in some cases, the main species present. The main causes of pressure are referred to, including pollution, fishing and physical damage. No indication is given as to which habitats affected are affected by the specific pressure. The report states that the ‘conservation status of the marine habitats is expected to remain stable or decrease between now and 2020’.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D6;Adequacy;Targets (Article 10);"The UK has proposed seven targets and ten associated indicators to cover its Western Mediterranean waters for biodiversity. The targets are split into three categories: marine mammals, seabirds and fish. 

In the accompanying text, the UK indicates that, for benthic habitats, the measures taken under the Habitats Directive, the WFD and the Gibraltar Biodiversity Action Plan are sufficient to achieve GES. The UK also stated that BOPA monitoring (mostly used under the WFD to measure eutrophication in benthic species) currently indicates that all benthic habitats are at GES. The measures under the WFD are also indicated to be sufficient to achieve GES for water column habitats. 

The targets defined specifically for the MSFD therefore all relate to the three species groups. The defined targets include both state and pressure targets but remain quite general. The targets do not address specific species except the Mediterranean Shag. In the accompanying text, the UK indicates that more specific thresholds need to be set for these species. The targets also state that various species components should not be significantly impacted or that a significant proportion of a population should meet individual targets. It is however not clarified what constitutes a significant impact or proportion. 

The targets indicate that cetacean populations should remain stable, seabird populations should be maintained in good condition and sensitive fish populations should be recovered. The achievability of target stating that fish species distribution, population size and community composition are not significantly impacted by human activities is uncertain, depending on what is considered by significant. 

In relation to the pressure targets for both cetaceans and fish it is stated that human impacts should not be significant in a general way, only for seabirds are some human pressures defined more specifically (e.g. accidental capture, oiling).";The targets defined by the UK for biodiversity in the Western Mediterranean region are considered partially adequate. The targets address three species groups and do not refer to specific species except for the Mediterranean Shag. There are no clearly defined thresholds. Most pressures are referred to in general as human activities with the exception of by-catch which is referred to for several targets. For benthic and water column habitats, it is stated in the accompanying text that GES will be achieved due to measures implemented under other legislation.

Both the GES definitions and the targets lack specific parameters, thresholds and baselines that are measurable without further work.

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D8;Adequacy;GES (Article 9);"The UK has defined GES for Descriptor 8 for Gibraltar at criteria level, covering both criteria of the Commission Decision and all three indicators. 

Concentration of contaminants

Criterion 8.1 is covered with the two first bullet points of the GES definition. The UK refers to the three matrices for the measurement of concentration of contaminants: water, sediment and biota. It also refers to the relevant EU legislation by specifying in a footnote that agreed levels are those agreed under the Water Framework Directive (i.e. the EQS). In addition, the UK refers to the EQS directly in the second bullet point of the definition. In this second bullet point, the UK also mentions “international obligations” but does not specify what it means with this. As Gibraltar belongs to the Mediterranean marine region, it is not certain that this refers to OSPAR’s Environmental Assessment Criteria (EAC). 

In addition to requiring concentration levels to be below agreed standards, the UK has added a condition that concentrations should not be increasing, which goes further than the Directive and the Decision (and is in line with the GES definition for the UK NEA waters). Presumably, the baseline for this is the current status. Therefore this condition is applicable only for the substances for which the UK has made an assessment of current status. 

The UK does not specify which substances are covered by the GES definition but in the accompanying text, it refers to synthetic and non-synthetic compounds as well as “other substances considered pollutants, whether solid, liquid or gas” which broadens the scope of the GES definition. It is likely that the substances covered are those covered under the Water Framework Directive. 

Although not very detailed, the two GES statements on concentration of contaminants are measurable and specific since they refer to agreed standards. 

Effects of contaminants

Criterion 8.2 on effects of contaminants is covered by the last three bullet points. However, there is some doubt as to whether these bullet points should be considered as part as the GES definition or as environmental targets. This is triggered by the inclusion of the word “target” in bullet point 3 on oil spills. It is also supported by the accompanying text in the section entitled “approach to setting GES targets” which provides further explanation on the last two bullet points on benthic species and the BOPA index. For the sake of this report, we will consider all the bullet points to be part of the GES definition. 

Rather than using typical indicators for biological effects of contaminants (indicator 8.2.1), such as imposex or lysosomal membrane stability, the UK has decided to choose some benthic species as an indicator of the level of contamination of the assessed areas. It is also using the BOPA index. This index is more predominantly used in the WFD to assess the effects of eutrophication on benthic species. The relationship with the effects of hazardous substances on benthic species is not clear (although a link to the effects of oil spills may be established). 

The two last GES statements are measurable since one refers to an agreed index and the other requires abundance and distribution to remain stable or decrease to naturally occurring levels (although these are not specified through a quantitative threshold). In addition, in the accompanying text, the UK provides details as to possible species that will be used as indicators (Corbula gibba and Cirriformia tentaculata). 

For indicator 8.2.2 on acute pollution events, the UK refers to the established EQS and EAC to measure the significance of the impacts of spills of chemical compounds and the appropriate response. It is uncertain what is meant with this. It could to mean that response to chemical spills will be provided if the EQS/EAC for these substances are exceeded, but this is just an assumption and is not explicitly explained by the UK. For oil, the UK does not provide any standards, thresholds or baseline to be used to measure GES, although the use of the BOPA index could be related to the effects of oil pollution on ecosystem components. This would mean that indicator 8.2.2 is partly quantified through the BOPA index. However for extent and frequency of events, the UK states that “targets” (which could mean either GES boundaries or targets to reach GES) should be “incident-specific”, which means that no GES boundary is provided in the current definition. ";The UK GES definition for D8 for Gibraltar is considered partially adequate. The UK has made the relevant references to agreed standards, included the EQS Directive, and has added a condition that concentrations should not increase. The UK has also provided definitions of GES for biological effects of contaminants using benthic species as indicators of contamination. For acute pollution events, the definition is not specific regarding the extent and frequency of acute pollution events but it is more specific regarding effects of oil pollution on ecosystem components, using a quantified index as reference level (BOPA index). Finally, it is uncertain whether certain statements constitute an actual definition of GES or if they should be considered as targets (in particular considering that no targets have been defined for D8).;"- Reference to relevant standards including the EQS directive

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D8;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK produces a very brief assessment of the state of contamination of its Mediterranean marine waters by hazardous substances. 

Hazardous substances

Based on the conclusions from the assessment of Coastal Water body under the WFD in 2011, which states that it is in “Good Ecological and Chemical Status”, the UK has not provided any additional information about sources of contamination, relevant substances and input loads. It only mentions that Gibraltar has few industries and therefore few sources of land-based hazardous waste “likely to enter the coastal area except through the sewerage system or marine pathways”.

It provides more details on contamination by TBT and DBT as the assessment of Heavily Modified Water Body of Gibraltar Harbour under the WFD in 2011 concluded on a failed Chemical Status because of elevated levels of TBT and DBT. The UK therefore briefly describes the sources of contamination but does not provide any quantitative information regarding input loads. 

With regard to biological effects, the UK reports that the main effect identified in Gibraltar relates to the elevated levels of TBT in the Harbour and the related abnormalities and hermaphroditic deformities in some benthic invertebrate species exposed to high levels. Since the other assessment areas have been assessed as being in Good Chemical Status, the UK considers that biological effects of hazardous substances in these areas are minimal. They note the elevated levels of contaminants in tissue samples of certain cetaceans (in particular Delphinidae) due to the industrial and shipping activities of the Bay and Straits of Gibraltar. 

The UK has concluded that under a business-as-usual scenario (with implementation of existing water legislation) progress (but not achievement of) to GES is likely by 2020 with further improvements by 2030. The UK does not make an aggregated judgment of the current level of pressure in relation to GES but keeps referring to the assessment of Good Chemical Status under the WFD. 

Finally, the UK provides an indication of knowledge and data gaps, in particular the need additional contaminant analyses on fish and other marine organisms in order to assess the risks of contamination in specific marine organisms and the likelihood of bioaccumulation from long term contaminants such as heavy metals and organotins. It mentions that this will be dealt with in the monitoring programmes. 

Radionuclides

The UK reports that there are no major sources of radioactive pollution in Gibraltar and that monitoring is on-going. Monitoring in coastal waters and sediments have shown that levels recorded to date are below EU safe limits and that biological effects from radioactive contamination are unlikely in Gibraltar. 

Acute pollution events

The UK reports on oil contamination, mentioning that it is a major environmental consideration in the areas with high levels of vessel activity. The report does not include quantitative information on number, extent and frequency of incidents over the past years. It just provides an indication of the prevention measures in place. It also describes potential discharges from an oil refinery but again does not provide any quantitative details.

It reports on the biological effects of oil pollution, describing the typical effects from oil pollution but only mentioning for the specific situation of Gibraltar that spills are likely to be small, surface-based and short-lived and that the main risks are to birds and surface dwelling organisms. No additional information is provided for the specific situation of Gibraltar. 

The UK concludes that it is unlikely that current levels of contamination from acute pollution events are maintained by 2020 considering the increasing amount of vessel traffic, however oil contamination from road run-offs should decrease. It mentions that additional monitoring and surveillance are needed and that regional cooperation is crucial for Gibraltar on this specific topic.";The assessment of contamination by hazardous substances, radionuclides and acute pollution events for Gibraltar is considered partially adequate. The UK makes an effort to report on all three pressures and provides an assessment of current and future levels. It also provides an indication of knowledge gaps and actions be taken to address them. However, the assessment is very poor in terms of quantification. It mostly describes the effects of pollution in a generic manner but does not provide a detailed account of the sources, the input loads to the environment or the extent of the environment or ecosystem components affected. The assessment for hazardous substances focuses almost solely on TBT and DBT.;"- Effort made to report on all three types of pressure

United Kingdom (Mediterranean);D9;Adequacy;Initial assessment (Article 8);"The UK reports very briefly the tests done by the UK Environmental Agency on fish and other seafood for human consumption in Gibraltar following the requirements of Regulation 1881/2006. It mentions that these tests indicate that contaminant levels rarely exceed reference levels but more vulnerable people are advised not to eat tuna, marlin and swordfish because of elevated mercury content.

Apart from mercury in these three species, the UK report does not provide indication of what substances and what species are monitored. As for the GES definition, the UK justifies its limited reporting to the fact that it predominantly imports its fish and seafood.

Microbial pathogens

The UK reports more extensively on contamination by microbial pathogens of Gibraltar waters. It describes the six main bathing areas of Gibraltar, the sources of contamination and the monitoring following the requirements of Directive 2006/7/EC. The UK does not mention the requirements of the Shellfish Waters Directive, anyway repealed since 2013. The biological effects from microbial contamination on public health and on fish and seafood are also described in general but not specifically for Gibraltar waters. 

The UK mentions that only one beach out of six has been found to exceed regulatory levels for total coliforms and e-coli in 2012 because of an input of untreated sewage from an overflow located in mainland Spain.

The UK mentions that the quality of waters on one particular beach (Western Beach) has been worsening over the past few years and explains that overflows from adjacent Spain may be part of the problem with the degradation of the quality of waters. It describes the cooperation taking place with Spain to address the issue.  ";The assessment of contamination of fish and seafood in Gibraltar (including from microbial pathogens) is considered inadequate. The assessment is very limited and does not provide sufficient details regarding substances and species monitored.
