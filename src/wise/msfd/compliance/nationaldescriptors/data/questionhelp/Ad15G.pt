  According to Art. 22 of the Directive, given the priority inherently attached
  to the establishment of marine strategies, the implementation of this
  Directive must be supported by existing Community financial instruments in
  accordance with applicable rules and conditions. The programmes drawn up by

  The MS should provide information on how the implementation of the directive
  is supported by existing community financial instruments in accordance with
  applicable rules and conditions. Member states should provide indications/a
  list of the different European funds (e.g. European Maritime Aquaculture and
  Fisheries Fund (EMFAF), Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), European Regional
  Development Fund (ERDF), Cohesion Fund (CF), LIFE programme, HORIZON fund)
  they plan to mobilise to co-fund the implementation of the measures.
