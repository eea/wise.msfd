  The update/changes relate to existing measures that were adopted for the
  purpose of other policies
  <u>after the Programme of Measures 2016-2021 had been established</u>.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The Member State should provide a list and a justification of new existing
  measures that are included in the second cycle PoM.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">Indicate if there is such information in the text report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicate if it is presented in the general overview or if it is specific
      for each descriptor
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify whether the new existing measures are presented in a general way
      in the text or if there is a full detailed list (e.g. presented in a
      table).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US"><br /></p>
<p>
  There are specific schema fields to check in the e-reporting to answer this
  question. The assessor can filter them to see whether any new existing measure
  was included in the PoM. However, under this completeness question, the
  assessor will check whether any information about the update to the existing
  measures is available in the text report. A detailed analysis of the new
  existing measures will be done for each descriptor by answering adequacy
  question Ad01B.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Start by stating which response option you have selected and continue
  explaining why.
