<p>
  Before carrying out a gap analysis, the Member States should update the
  measures, identified in the first cycle, that are already in place under other
  policies (Existing measures- category 1 a,b), that contribute to addressing
  the predominant pressures identified in the Art. 8 assessment and reaching
  MSFD environmental targets under Art. 10.
</p>
<p>The update/changes to be assessed under this questions relate to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      existing measures (category 1) from the first cycle that have been
      modified (we&rsquo;ll call them &lsquo;modified existing measures&rsquo;)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      existing measures (category 1) that were adopted for the purpose of
      other policies
      <u>after the Programme of Measures 2016-2021 had been established</u> (we
      will call them &lsquo;additional existing measures&rsquo;)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Member State should provide a list and a justification of modified or
  additional category 1 measures that are included in the second cycle PoM.

  <u>To know whether the MS has </u
  ><u><strong>modified existing measures</strong></u
  ><u> or defined </u><u><strong>additional existing measures</strong></u
  ><u> (adopted for the purposes of other policies after 2015)</u>, there are
  specific schema fields to check in the e-reporting. The assessor can filter
  them to see whether any changes to existing measures are made in the updated
  POM. In addition, under this completeness question, the assessor will check
  whether any information about the update to the existing measures is available
  in the text report. We expect the MS to mention/explain in the text report:
</p>
<p>
  - modifications made to category 1 measures from the first cycle (modified
  existing measures)
</p>
<p>
  - any policy developments since 2016 relevant to the different descriptors for
  which specific measures were adopted and must therefore be reported in the POM
  as category 1 a,b measures (additional existing measures). This includes both
  developments at EU level and at regional level (Regional Sea Convention).
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Under this completeness questions we only check if information on updates to
  existing measures is presented in the text report and indicate and list
  whether there are any existing measures reported electronically as
  &lsquo;modified since 2015 POM&rsquo; or &lsquo;new in 2021 POM&rsquo;. A
  detailed analysis of the additional existing measures will be done for each
  descriptor by answering to adequacy question Ad01B.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Yes: </strong>the Member State provided a complete overview of
      relevant updates to the existing measures (category 1). In the
      e-reporting: some category 1 measures are reported as &lsquo;modified
      since 2015 POM&rsquo; or &lsquo;new in 2021 POM&rsquo;. The e-reporting
      includes an explanation on why these have been modified/created (measures
      description); in the text report, you find supporting information about
      updates to existing measures.

      <strong>Partially:</strong> the Member State provided an overview of

      e-reporting: some category 1 measures are reported as &lsquo;modified
      since 2015 POM&rsquo; or &lsquo;new in 2021 POM&rsquo;, but the
      e-reporting does not include an explanation on why these have been
      modified/created (measures description); in the text report, you find some
      supporting information about updates to existing measures, but it is not
      complete/clear or it is provided only for some descriptors and not for
      other.

    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not clear: </strong>the information reported in the e-report and

      not.
