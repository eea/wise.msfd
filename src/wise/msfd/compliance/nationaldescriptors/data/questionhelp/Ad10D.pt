<p>
  With relation to Article 14.1 the MSFD obliges Member States to identify
  instances where the environmental targets or GES cannot be achieved in every
  aspect/cannot be achieved within the time schedule in the programmes of
  measures. Member States' views have to be substantiated to the Commission
  together with consideration of the consequences for Member States in the
  marine region or subregion concerned.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Article 14.4 provides for a possibility not to take specific steps (measures)
  due to their disproportionate costs or lack of significant risk to the marine
  environment. If invoked, Member States must avoid that the achievement of GES
  be permanently compromised and provide the Commission with the necessary
  justification to substantiate its decision. As mentioned above, Member States
  cannot apply exceptions under Article 14 to the whole territory of their
  marine waters. Given that exceptions under Article 14.4 concern 'specific
  steps' (measures), Member States are strongly advised to consider which
  measures trigger disproportionate costs or when there is no significant risk
  to the marine environment when drafting their programmes of measures.
  Exceptions under Article 14.4 are an integral part of the programmes of
  measures and are thereby subject to the same requirements on public
  consultation.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Exceptions under the MSFD need to be interpreted in the light of the general
  objectives of the Directive (the protection of marine environment) and the
  operational objectives (achievement of GES). The interpretation of Article 14
  of the MSFD should be restrictive. The justification for applying exceptions
  provided by Member States should be kept simple and the information provided
  should be factual, precise, verifiable and clear enough to prove the necessity
  of the application of Article 14 of the MSFD.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The lack of justification and publication of exceptions as well as the use of
  exceptions that do fulfil the criteria listed above renders the use of the
  exception questionable and therefore failure to implement the related measures
  unjustified.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The assessor must assess the quality of the justification. Article 14 does not
  specify further details as to the minimum elements MS must provide to the
  Commission. For the moment, there has never been an infringement procedure
  concerning the exceptions of Article 14, so no case law. GD 18 provides the
  following guidance for reporting a justification:

  The assessment of the justification provided by MS to &lsquo;substantiate
  their view&rsquo; under the second sub-paragraph of Article 14.1 will be done
  on a case-by-case analysis, depending on the reason invoked. The justification
  will be assessed by studying the national and regional circumstances
  prevailing in every case, in order to determine whether that use as applied
  and reported by the Member States is grounded.
</p>
<p lang="en-US"><br /></p>
<p>
  Exception under Art. 14.4 raises some difficulties of interpretation, in
  particular in terms of what can be considered as &lsquo;significant
  risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;significant costs&rsquo;. As discussed in the context
  of POMESA<a href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a> ,
  the latter must be understood in the context of the MSFD and in light of the
  precautionary principle, this was agreed to be only the case either in
  elements that are in GES or, at least, not deteriorating, in which case it
  should be justified by the Member State through recent data stemming from the
  monitoring programme.

          In line with available discussions and with work carried out in
          support to the WFD implementation process, whether costs are
          significant (significantly disproportionate) or not can be assessed at
          different scales: (a) at the scale of society &ndash; by comparing the
          costs of proposed measures for achieving GES with the benefits
          expected from the achievement of GES (building inter alias on the
          assessment of the ecosystem services delivered as a result of
          achieving GES). If costs of measures are higher (or higher by x% -
          e.g. 20%) than total benefits expected from achieving GES, than these
          costs could be considered as disproportionate &ndash; and support the
          justification of execeptions ; (b) at the scale of individual
          activities or of a sector that will support the costs of measures
          &ndash; by assessing the relative importance of the costs of measures
          (considered as additional to costs already supported by sectors) in
          comparison to the added value of the activity or sector, its revenues
          or its disposable income. This assessment will deliver different
          outcome if carried out for individual professionals (with their
          diversity) or at the level of the entire sector; or (c) at the scale
          of the government which budget might be &ndash; or not be - sufficient
          to finance all measures proposed for achieving GES.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the justification of cost disproportionality depends on the
          capacity of governments, local authorities or private operators to
          access financing beyond what is usually secured (in governments
          budgets e.g.). Indeed, a measure might be considered as
          disproportionately costly if an operator needs to fully support its
          costs &ndash; but not disproportionately costly if innovative
          financing (e.g. payments for ecosystem services) or access to
          subsidies (e.g. EU subsidies) is put in place for reducing the burden
          to the same operator. Which cost types are to be considered (direct
          financial costs of measures, indirect and/or induced costs &ndash;
          accounting for impacts on value chains and territorial development for
          example) requires also some common understanding to ensure coherence
          between justifications proposed by different MS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although economic assessments can shed lights on the assessment of
          cost disproportionality, it is important to remember that what is
          meant by &ldquo;disproportionality&rdquo; retains a political
          dimension. In some cases, the limit between what can be considered
          disproportionate or disproportionately costly can be discussed within
          stakeholder processes &ndash; and agreed during the stakeholder
          process itself on the basis of sound justifications building on
          socio-economic assessments and/or on the perceived (expected) social
          and economic impacts of different measures.

  The assessor should check if the same exceptions are used as in the first
  cycle. If the same exception is used as in the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle, the
  assessor will check whether some further action beyond the use of the
  exception has been taken at national level in order to, if not achieve GES or
  the environmental targets, at least improve the environmental conditions in
