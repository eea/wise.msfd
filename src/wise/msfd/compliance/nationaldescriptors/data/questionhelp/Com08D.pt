<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>check if any exceptions are reported, for which descriptor and whether exceptions reported in the first cycles have been modified</li>
    <li>list the exceptions and specify what type they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this question, priority will be given to e-reporting as there are specific schema fields for each measure. If there is no information in the e-reporting, check the text report. Specify where this information is found in the text report.</p>
