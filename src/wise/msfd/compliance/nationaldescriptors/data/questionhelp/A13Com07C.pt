  According to the GD10, the Member States should report in the &lsquo;General
  overview&rsquo; (the text report) and summary of identified spatial protection
  measures and the purpose for which they are put in place.
</p>
<p>
  The updated Programme of Measures should indicate whether further spatial
  protection measures are to be identified and for which purpose (conservation
  objectives e.g., specific species, seabed, etc.) they are put in place
  (Article 13(4)). In particular, it should explain how these measures will
  contribute to coherent and representative networks of marine protected areas
  (MPAs), adequately covering the diversity of the constituent ecosystems in the
  (sub)region.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, when applicable, the PoM should indicate whether management
  measures in MPAs have been identified and implemented.
</p>
<p>
  If relevant, provide a list of spatial protection measures and a summary of
  the information reported.
</p>
<p>Specify where this information is found in the text report.</p>
