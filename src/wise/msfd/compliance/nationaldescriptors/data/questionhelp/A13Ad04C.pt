<p>
  This question assesses the consistency of the reporting across Article 13 (the
  measures) and Article 8 (the pressures). It refers to the pressures that the
  gap analysis identified (or should have identified) as needing to be
  addressed.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  There are specific schema fields to check in the e-reporting to determine
  whether the Member State has clearly indicated what pressure(s) the measure
  addresses. The assessor should cross-check this information with the
  information reported under Article 8 to verify they are consistent. However,
  the way pressures are addressed in Art 8 is quite generic, just listing the
  type of pressure from the enumeration list &ndash; see table below.
</p>

  <em
    >An indicative list of pressures considered for Article 8(1)(b) assessments.
    Certain pressures are directly relevant for particular descriptors and have
    associated criteria in the GES Decision (primary criteria are in bold),
    whilst other pressures needed to be considered in relation to Article
    8(1)(a) assessments.</em

<p>
  Note that, according to the definition in GD10, options f, g and h do not fall
  within the definition of measures, but if reported in the PoM update (e.g.
  because they were also reported in the first cycle), they should be classified
  here. These categories should only be used when they are the main focus of the
  reported &lsquo;measure&rsquo; (i.e. not if they are a component of a measure
  focused on categories a-e).
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  In addition, the assessor should check the text report to verify whether any
  supporting information justifies how the different pressures are addressed by
  the modified new measures and the additional new measures in the second cycle,
  i.e. assess whether the measures address all reported activities.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  List the measures (codes and titles) and provide a brief summary, plus
  conclusions about the addressed pressures.
</p>

  To present the information, the assessor should fill the following table,
  clearly distinguishing between the modified new measures and the additional
  new measures:
