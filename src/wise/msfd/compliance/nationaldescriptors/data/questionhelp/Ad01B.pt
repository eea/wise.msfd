<p>
  Before carrying out a gap analysis, the Member States should update the
  measures, identified in the first cycle, that are already in place under other
  policies (Existing measures- category 1 a,b), that contribute to addressing
  the predominant pressures identified in the Art. 8 assessment and reaching
  MSFD environmental targets under Art. 10.
</p>
<p>The update/changes to be assessed under this question relate to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      existing measures (category 1) from the first cycle that have been
      modified (we&rsquo;ll call them &lsquo;modified existing measures&rsquo;)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      existing measures (category 1) that were adopted for the purpose of other
      policies
      <u>after the Programme of Measures 2016-2021 had been established</u> (we
      will call them &lsquo;additional existing measures&rsquo;)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Member State should provide a list and a justification of modified or
  additional category 1 measures that are included in the second cycle PoM.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  <u
    >There are specific schema fields to check in the e-reporting to answer this
    question + the information found in the text report (check answer to Com02B
    question as a starting point). To know whether the MS has </u
  ><u><strong>modified existing measures</strong></u
  ><u> or defined </u><u><strong>additional existing measures</strong></u
  ><u> (adopted for the purposes of other policies after 2015)</u>, there are
  specific schema fields to check in the e-reporting. The assessor can filter
  them to see whether any changes to existing measures are made in the updated
  POM (a list of modified or additional existing measures is already presented
  in answer to Com02B question).
</p>
<p>
  Under this adequacy question, the assessor will check whether any information
  about the update to the existing measures is available in the text report and
  judget whether they consider it adequate for the descriptor. We expect the MS
  to mention/explain in the text report:
</p>
<p>
  - modifications made to category 1 measures from the first cycle (modified
  existing measures)
</p>
<p>
  - any policy developments since 2016 relevant to the different descriptors for
  which specific measures were adopted and must therefore be reported in the POM
  as category 1 a,b measures (additional existing measures). This includes both
  developments at EU level and at regional level (Regional Sea Convention).
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Annex A of GD 10 (section 1) provides, for each GES descriptor, an indicative
  list of relevant EU legislation (Table below). The list is indicative. If the
  assessor finds that additional legislation should be considered (e.g. for D5
  National Emission Ceilings Directive, for D1-3-6 we&rsquo;d expect MS
  mentioning the adoption of technical measures regulation
  (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R1241) as an
  important step towards GES for those D&rsquo;s), it should clearly explain why
  it is important for the descriptor that the MS adds measures linked to that
  legislation/policy.

  The assessor should provide a conclusion on whether it is clear why any of the
  existing measures have been modified and why the additional existing measures
  are relevant for the descriptor and how they contribute to achieving the
  objectives of MSFD. Background information about the measures can be found in
  &lsquo;measure description&rsquo; (which is an option field) or in the text
  report. The other schema fields mentioned above (&lsquo;Source of
  information&rsquo;) can help gather more details regarding the measure.
