  The assessor must check if the information is reported for all measures in the
  relevant schema fields and assess its adequacy. With his/her technical
  expertise, the assessors should know whether a pressure is more prevalent in
  an area than others. MRUs can be checked at the following link:

  For this question, priority will be given to e-reporting as there are specific
  schema fields for each measure. If there is no information in the e-reporting,
  check the text report. Specify where this information is found in the text
  report.

<p><strong>Use of response options:</strong></p>

  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Yes: </strong>the Member State explained where the modified and
      additional new measures will be implemented<strong> - </strong>all the

      implementation locations are considered adequate
    </p>

  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Partially: </strong>at least 1/3 of the required schema fields are

  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not clear:</strong> there is not enough information to understand

  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>No:</strong> the Member State has not explained where the modified

<p><strong>Structure of the summary box:</strong></p>
<p>
  Start by stating which response option you have selected and continue
  explaining why. Highlight where main gaps are and for which measure(s), so
  that it is easier to draft recommendations.
