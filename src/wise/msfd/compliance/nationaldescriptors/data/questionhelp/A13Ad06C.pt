  The assessor must check if information is reported for all measures in the
  relevant schema fields. Select &lsquo;yes&rsquo; if all the schema fields are
  specified for all relevant measures, &lsquo;partially&rsquo; if at least 1/3
  of them are specified or if they are all specified but not for all the
  relevant measures, &lsquo;not clear&rsquo; if the information reported is not
  clear and inconsistent, &lsquo;no&rsquo; if they are not specified for any of
  the relevant measures.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Select &lsquo;not relevant&rsquo; if there are no modified and additional new
  measures.

  For this question, priority will be given to e-reporting as there are specific
  schema fields for each measure. If there is no information in the e-reporting,
  check the text report. Specify where this information is found in the text
  report.
