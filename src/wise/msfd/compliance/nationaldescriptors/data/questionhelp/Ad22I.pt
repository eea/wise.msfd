<p lang="fr-FR">
  Member States (MS) should explain how the views of stakeholders were
  considered in the new PoM.
</p>
<p lang="fr-FR">
  The assessors should verify if the stakeholders&rsquo; views, for the
  different descriptors/measures, were considered and integrated in the new PoM.
</p>
<p>
  For the response option, the assessors, should select: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if
  the stakeholders views (including for the descriptors/measures) were taken
  into account, &ldquo;Partially&rdquo; if the stakeholders views were partially
  taken into account (note: for both responses the assessors should mention the
  measures/descriptors for which the stakeholders views were taken into
  account), &ldquo;No&rdquo; if the stakeholders views were not taken into
  account, and &ldquo;No Information&rdquo; if no information exists.
