  Use only e-reporting, There are specific schema fields to check in the
  e-reporting to answer this question. If no information found in e-reporting,
  check text report. There may be cases where text reporting and e-reporting are
  not consistent. The assessors can double-check in the module what were the
  measures defined in the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      filter the relevant schema fields to see whether any new measure was
      modified in the second cycle PoM
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      list all modified measures per descriptor (code and title).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the gap analysis defined that there is no need, this question is &lsquo;not
  relevant&rsquo;.
