  The new Biodiversity Strategy sets a 30% target for MPAs (of which, 10%
  strictly protected). The PoM should make clear reference to this in its text.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>TL should consider the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Does the new MPA establish a clear link between the achievement of GES and
      the pressures identified?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Does it link to exiting measures? (combination of MPA and other spatial
      measures)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Are the new designated areas already part of the N2000 network?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      What are the conservation objectives of the new designated areas? What is
      aiming to protect?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      What measures have been taken in addition to designation to reduce
      pressures and effectively protect species and/or habitats in the area?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Are references made to the new

      Guidance on the designation of new protected areas to reach the
      Biodiversity Strategy targets for 2030?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Does MS indicate how it intends to ensure that the designated area can
      count towards the 10/30% targets?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The assessor must present the correlation between the scope of the MPA and
      the linked descriptor in a table if this information is available in the
      POMs
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Provide assessment if new MPA measures contribute to specific KTMs (and
  pressures).

<p><strong>Use of response options:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Yes&nbsp;:</strong> the new MPA measures are considered adequate
      &ndash; all aspects mentioned above are well addressed
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Partially:</strong> the new MPA measures are considered partially
      adequate &ndash; half of the aspects mentioned above are well addressed
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not clear:</strong> there is not enough information to understand
      if the new MPA measures are adequate; the information reported is not
      clear and inconsistent; the aspects listed above are only explained in
      external documents
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>No:</strong> the new MPA measures are considered not adequate
      &ndash; all aspects mentioned above are not well addressed
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not relevant:</strong> for D1, D4 and D6 no new MPA measures are
      defined (see answer to Com07C. question); always for D2, D3, D5, D7, D8,
      D9, D10 and D11.

  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Structure of summary box:</strong></p>
<p>
  Start by stating which response option you have selected and continue
  explaining why. Refer to all the aspects mentioned in the bullets points
  above. For D1, D4 and D6: highlight where main gaps are and for which
  measure(s), so that it is easier to draft recommendations. Specify where this
  information is found in the text report.
