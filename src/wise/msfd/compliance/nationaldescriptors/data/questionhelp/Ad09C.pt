  The new Biodiversity Strategy sets a 30% target for MPAs (of which, 10%
  strictly protected). The PoM should make clear reference to this in its text.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>TL should consider the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Does the new MPA establish a clear link between the achievement of GES and
      the pressures identified?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Does it link to exiting measures? (combination of MPA and other spatial
      measures)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Are the new designated areas already part of the N2000 network?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      What are the conservation objectives of the new designated areas? What is
      aiming to protect?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      What measures have been taken in addition to designation to reduce
      pressures and effectively protect species and/or habitats in the area?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Are references made to the new

      Guidance on the designation of new protected areas to reach the
      Biodiversity Strategy targets for 2030?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Does MS indicate how it intends to ensure that the designated area can
      count towards the 10/30% targets?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The assessor must present the correlation between the scope of the MPA and
      the linked descriptor in a table if this information is available in the
      POMs
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Provide assessment if new MPA measures contribute to specific KTMs (and
  pressures).
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If the PoMs report provides a link to another document with information about
  MPAs, then the answer &lsquo;partially&rsquo;?
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Specify where this information is found in the text report.</p>
