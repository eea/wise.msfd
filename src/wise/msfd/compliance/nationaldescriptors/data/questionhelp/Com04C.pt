<p>
  When a measure has been withdrawn, i.e. contrary to the Programme of Measures
  reported under Article 13, the measure is no longer intended to be put into
  practice. That means that the measure has been cancelled for objective,
  specific and transparent reasons.
</p>
<p>
  If a measure has been withdrawn, this amounts to an update of the Programme of
  Measures. The updated Programme of Measures has to be reported only under
  Article 13.
