<p>A gap analysis is adequate if the PoM:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Provides, for each descriptor, an overview of the current status, by
      referring to the results of Art. 8 assessments. It should be clear whether
      GES is not currently being achieved. If the information is not provided in
      the text report, the TL should check Art. 8 reporting (&lsquo;GES
      achieved&rsquo; schema field&rsquo;) and its assessment in the module. In
      principle, the MS should have reported &lsquo;GES extent achieved&rsquo;
      which indicates to what extent GES has been achieved for the Feature (as a
      percentage or proportion), including how this is measured (e.g. number of
      contaminants or species, extent of area). This should help quantify the
      gap to achieve GES and as a consequence the need for specific measures to
      address a specific pressure.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Provides, for each descriptor, an overview of progress on the
      environmental targets. If the information is not provided in the text
      report, the TL should check Art. 10 reporting and its assessment in the
      module.

      For those descriptors for which the MS reported measures focusing on
      monitoring and other scientific efforts to increase the knowledge on the
      marine environment in the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle, the MS should have
      assessed whether there has been any progress on the elements researched,
