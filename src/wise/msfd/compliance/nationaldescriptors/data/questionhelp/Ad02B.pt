  The gap analysis is a requirement under GD10 and clearly supports the analysis
  underlying the PoMs, under Art.13.
</p>
<p>A gap analysis is adequate if the PoM:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Provides, for each descriptor, an overview of the current status, by
      referring to the results of Art. 8 assessments. It should be clear whether
      GES is not currently being achieved. If the information is not provided in
      the text report, the TL should check Art. 8 reporting (&lsquo;GES
      achieved&rsquo; schema field&rsquo;) and its assessment in the module. In
      principle, the MS should have reported &lsquo;GES extent achieved&rsquo;
      which indicates to what extent GES has been achieved for the Feature (as a
      percentage or proportion), including how this is measured (e.g. number of
      contaminants or species, extent of area). This should help quantify the
      gap to achieve GES and as a consequence the need for specific measures to
      address a specific pressure.

  <li>
    <p>
      Provides, for each descriptor, an overview of progress on the
      environmental targets. If the information is not provided in the text
      report, the TL should check Art. 10 reporting and its assessment in the
      module.

          The baseline scenario should be used as the benchmark against which

      For those descriptors for which the MS reported measures focusing on
      monitoring and other scientific efforts to increase the knowledge on the
      marine environment in the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle, the MS should have
      assessed whether there has been any progress on the elements researched
      and whether this progress can materialise in the 2<sup>nd</sup> cycle on
      measures addressing specific pressures on them.

      Provides a clear conclusion on whether the measures from the 1<sup

      cycle and updated existing measures are sufficient to achieve MSFD
      environmental targets and achieve or maintain GES as well as a timeline
      for when this will be achieved.It is not acceptable that a Member State
      does not carry out a gap analysis because GES is achieved. A gap analysis
      should still be carried out to understand what measures to put in place to
      maintain GES.

      We do not expect the gaps to be quantified: the only instance for MS to
      quantify the gaps in achieving GES is if they have quantified GES (under
      Articles 9 and 8). The assessor can check Art. 12 assessments to verify if
      this is the case (questions A09Ad5, A09Ad6, A09Ad7, A08Ad4). If they
      haven&rsquo;t, we can&rsquo;t reasonably expect them to quantify gaps (and
      therefore measures). We&rsquo;ve already assessed them negatively in Art
      12 assessment for not quantifying GES. However, the assessor should make
      the point again in the recommendations: quantify GES to be able to
      quantify gaps to GES.
