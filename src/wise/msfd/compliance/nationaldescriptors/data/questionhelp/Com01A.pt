<p>
  GD10 requires that the details of the update of the Programme of Measures
  should explain which environmental targets (Article 10) it addresses, e.g.
  those reported in 2018 under Art. 17 in conjunction with Art. 10 MSFD, or any
  subsequent updates in the period leading up to the review and update of the
  PoM. The Member States should clarify in the POM (general overview of the text
  report) whether they have set any operational targets that relate to concrete
  implementation measures to support their achievement (MSFD Annex IV (2)).

      >For this question, we only look at the text-based report to understand
      whether targets and their possible updates are well presented.
    </strong></u
  >The specific link between environmental targets and measures is assessed
  under the adequacy question Ad05C. (Member States must indicate the relevant
  target for each measure in the e-reporting (schema field
  &lsquo;relevantTarget&rsquo;).
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">Indicate if there is such information in the text report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicate if it is presented in the general overview or if it is specific
      for each descriptor
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify whether the targets are presented in a general way in the text or
      there is a full detailed list of targets (e.g. presented in a table).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify whether the Member State presented new targets or updated targets
      in the PoM.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Member States must indicate the relevant target for each measure in the
      e-reporting (schema field &lsquo;relevantTarget&rsquo;). This will be
      assessed in the adequacy question Ad04C.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that the MS might use different terminology to identify the targets, e.g.
  objectives, priorities etc. Some level of interpretation of the EN translation
  is needed here.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Use of response options:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Yes</strong>: environmental targets and their possible updates are
      clearly presented in the text report for each descriptor. The MS clearly
      follows the logic of GD10 and presents the targets as the starting point
      for the POM update.<strong>Partially:</strong> targets are presented, but
      only in the form of a list/table, without any supporting explanation nor
      clear links made between the targets and the measures
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not clear: </strong>there is some information, but not enough/not
      clear to reply to the question.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>No:</strong> there is no information about the environmental
      target in the text report.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong><br /> </strong><strong>Structure of summary box:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Start by stating which response option you have selected and continue
  explaining why.
</p>
<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicate if information about environmental targets is found in the text
      report
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicate if it is presented in the general overview or if it is specific
      for each descriptor
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify whether the targets are presented in a general way in the text or
      there is a full detailed list of targets (e.g. presented in a table).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify whether the Member State presented new targets or updated targets
      in the PoM compared to those reported under Art. 10 and assessed under
      Art. 12.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This is applicable to all summary boxes. E.g. &lsquo;the MS has not provided
  an overview of the updated POM corresponding to environmental targets&rsquo;
  or &lsquo;The MS has provided a partial overview of the updated POM
  corresponding to environmental targets&rsquo; or &lsquo;It is not clear
  whether the MS has&hellip;&rsquo;.
