<p>
  The updated Programme of Measures should describe how the new measures will be
  implemented (e.g. by legal, policy, socio-economic or financial instruments),
  and provide an overview of potentially co-financed measures (Article 22) where
  relevant.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The assessor must check whether:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Implementation mechanisms are reported for each measure. The following
      schema fields: &lsquo;MeasureDescription&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;PoliciesConventions&rsquo;, PolicyNational,
      ResponsibleCompetentAuthority, ResponsibleOrganisation, CoordinationLevel,
      RegionalCooperation_countries.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Financing for the measures is secured (&lsquo;Financing&rsquo; schema
      field)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The measure description clearly explains the &lsquo;modes of
      actions&rsquo;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The MS clearly explains how the measures effectiveness will be assessed
      (&ldquo;Indicators&rdquo; schema field)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US"><br /></p>
<p>
  The assessor must check these three aspects are reported for all relevant
  measures in the relevant schema fields. Select &lsquo;yes&rsquo; if all
  aspects are clearly reported for all relevant measures,
  &lsquo;partially&rsquo; if only 1 or 2 out of three are specified or if they
  are all specified but not for all the relevant measures, &lsquo;not
  clear&rsquo; if the information reported is not clear and inconsistent,
  &lsquo;no&rsquo; if they are not specified for any of the relevant measures.
</p>
<p lang="en-US"><br /></p>
<p>
  A categorisation of the &lsquo;modes of action&rsquo; is provided in the
  guidance document (see GD 10, Annex A.3): technical, legislative, economic and
  policy-driven. The following categories were used for detailed reporting of
  new measures under Art. 13 MSFD under the first cycle:
</p>
<table >
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td >
        <p><strong>N&deg; Mode of action</strong></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td >
        <p>
          1 <strong>Technical:</strong> an actual action that one can see (and
          measure) in the field. In principle, a wide range of measures has a
          primarily technical mode of action.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td >
        <p>
          2 <strong>Legislative:</strong> Adapting or supplementing national
          environmental law and other national legislation influencing the
          marine environment to implement environmental targets and to
          achieve/maintain GES.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td >
        <p>
          3 <strong>Economic:</strong> such as economic incentives that provide
          financial motives to stimulate the desired behaviour or discourage
          unwanted behaviour. Financial instruments are often aimed at the
          uptake of technical measures.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td >
        <p>
          4 <strong>Policy-driven:</strong> Policy instruments can be economic
          incentives, but also other instruments, such as voluntary agreements
          with stakeholders, communication strategies, awareness-raising, and
          education.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  No specific schema field is included for the second cycle reporting, but these
  &lsquo;modes of action&rsquo; can be derived from the schema field
  &lsquo;MeasureDescription&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  In addition, GD18, p. 15-16 provides further guidance on what implementation
  status would mean for the different modes of action. This must be checked in
  the schema field &lsquo;ImplementationStatus&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Select &lsquo;not relevant&rsquo; if there are no modified and additional new
  measures.
</p>
<p lang="en-US"><br /></p>
<p>
  For this question, priority will be given to e-reporting as there are specific
  schema fields for each measure. If there is no information in the e-reporting,
  check the text report. Specify where this information is found in the text
  report.
