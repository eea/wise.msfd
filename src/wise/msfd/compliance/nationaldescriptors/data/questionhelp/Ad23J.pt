  operational, including the responsible authorities (e.g. municipalities,
  ministries, other public administrations/institutions) that are going to
  implement the PoM in the marine waters.

<p lang="fr-FR">The assessors should verify if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The justifications reported provide adequate information to understand
      what the operational framework is, the information provided is clear and
      in line with operational actions. Does it make a distinction between what
      is in place and what will be in place in the future?

  For the response option, the assessors should select: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if the
  information on administrative process, in particular mentioning the different
  public institutions/authorities responsible for the implementation of the PoM
  (including the high priority measures) is clearly presented,
  &ldquo;Partially&rdquo; if the MS presents part of the public
  institutions/authorities responsible for the implementation of the PoM,
  &ldquo;Not Clear&rdquo; if the administrative process is not clear, and
  &ldquo;No&rdquo; if the process proposed by the MS is not presented.
