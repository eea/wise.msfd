<p>
  When a measure has been withdrawn, i.e. contrary to the Programme of Measures
  reported under Article 13, the measure is no longer intended to be put into
  practice. That means that the measure has been cancelled for objective,
  specific and transparent reasons. In cases where &lsquo;Measure
  withdrawn&rsquo; is selected (see answer to Com04C question) , the MS must
  provide a reason in &lsquo;ImplementationReason&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  A predefined list of options for withdrawal, delay or other obstacles is
  provided, which are consistent with the reasons identified under WFD
  reporting, but with adaptations as needed in the context of the MSFD:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      No obstacles to implementation; default response for when implementation
      has proceeded as expected;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Acceptance: There are difficulties in the acceptance of the measure, e.g.
      by certain stakeholders, government departments, Member States or in an EU
      or regional context.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Financing: Lack of financing: no or insufficient budget (including
      material and staff costs) yet approved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Mechanism for implementation &ndash; national: There is a lack of
      mechanism for the implementation at the national level, e.g. the necessary
      regulation or other mechanism required for implementing the measure has
      not yet been adopted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Mechanism for implementation &ndash; regional: There is a lack of
      mechanism for the implementation in a Regional Sea Convention, e.g. the
      necessary regulation or other mechanism required for implementing the
      measure has not yet been adopted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Mechanism for implementation &ndash; EU: There is a lack of mechanism for
      the implementation at the EU level, e.g. the necessary regulation or other
      mechanism required for implementing the measure has not yet been adopted.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Mechanism for implementation &ndash; International: There is a lack of
      mechanism for the implementation at the international level, e.g. the
      necessary regulation or other mechanism required for implementing the
      measure has not yet been adopted.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Some further information about the measure might be reported in &lsquo;Measure
  description&rsquo;, &lsquo;Reason description&rsquo; and in the text report.
  The assessor should assess, with expert judgement, whether the justification
  provided is adequate.

<p><strong>Use of response options:</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Yes:</strong> There is an adequate justification for all the
      measures withdrawn.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Partially: </strong>There is an adequate justification for at
      least half of the measures withdrawn.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not clear</strong>: The justification provided in not clear or
      there is not enough information provided to understand why the measure(s)
      were withdrawn. The information provided in the e-report and the text
      report is inconsistent.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>No: </strong>The justification provided in not adequate or there
      is no justification.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not relevant</strong>: there are no measures withdrawn (see answer
      to Com04C question).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Structure of summary box:</strong></p>
<p>
  Start by stating which response option you have selected and continue
  explaining why.

<p lang="en-US"><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      list all withdrawn new measures per descriptor (code and title)
      <strong>in bullet point format</strong> including a comment on
