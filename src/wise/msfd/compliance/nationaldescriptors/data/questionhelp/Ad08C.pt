<p>
  The updated Programme of Measures should describe when the modified/additional
  new measures will be implemented.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The assessor must check if information is reported for all measures in the
  relevant schema fields and assess whether the timeframe is adequate to
  contribute to achieve GES.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  For this question, priority will be given to e-reporting as there are specific
  schema fields for each measure. If there is no information in the e-reporting,
  check the text report. Specify where this information is found in the text
  report.

<p><strong>Use of response options:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Yes: </strong>the Member State explained when the
      modified/additional new measures will be implemented<strong> - </strong
      >all required schema fields are clearly reported for all relevant measures
      and it is clear that measures will contribute to speed up the process to
      achieve GES in the next reporting cycle.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Partially: </strong>only half of the required schema fields are
      specified or if they are all specified but not for all the relevant
      measures;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not clear: </strong>there is not enough information to understand
      if the measures are linked to operational targets; the information
      reported is not clear and inconsistent
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>No: </strong>the Member State has not explained when the
      modified/additional new measures will be implemented - none of the
      required schema fields is reported for any of the relevant measures and
      nor there is information in the text report.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not relevant: </strong>there are no modified/additional new
      measures.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Structure of the summary box:</strong></p>
<p>
  Start by stating which response option you have selected and continue
  explaining why. Highlight where main gaps are and for which measure(s), so
  that it is easier to draft recommendations.
