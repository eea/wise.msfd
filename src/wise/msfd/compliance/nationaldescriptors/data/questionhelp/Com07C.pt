  According to the GD10, the Member States should report in the &lsquo;General
  overview&rsquo; (the text report) a summary of identified spatial protection
  measures and the purpose for which they are put in place.
</p>
<p>
  The updated Programme of Measures should indicate whether further spatial
  protection measures are to be identified and for which purpose (conservation
  objectives e.g., specific species, seabed, etc.) they are put in place
  (Article 13(4)). In particular, it should explain how these measures will
  contribute to coherent and representative networks of marine protected areas
  (MPAs), adequately covering the diversity of the constituent ecosystems in the
  (sub)region.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, when applicable, the PoM should indicate whether management
  measures in MPAs have been identified and implemented.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Yes: </strong>the Member State identified new spatial protection
      measures, including marine protected areas
    </p>

  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not clear:</strong> in the text report there is some information
      on spatial protection measures and marine protected areas, but it is not
      clear if new measures are defined.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>No: </strong>the Member State has not identified new spatial
      protection measures
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Structure of summary box:</strong></p>
<p>
  Start by stating which response option you have selected and continue
  explaining why. If new spatial protection measures are defined, provide a list
  and a summary of the information reported. Specify where this information is
  found in the text report.
