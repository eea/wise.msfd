  Member States (MS) should provide information in a clear and appropriate
  manner on how climate change has been considered in the review and update of
  the PoM. A description on how (new) measures help in mitigating against
  climate change and maintaining ecosystem functions.
</p>
<p lang="fr-FR">The assessors should check if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-FR">
      Climate change has been considered in the technical and economic
      assessment of measures/PoM.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-FR">
      The potential impact of proposed measures/PoM on Green House Gas (GHG)
      emissions have been assessed. Has it impacted the selection of (new)
      measures? If yes, how?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-FR">
      The measures are part of the climate change (adaptation) strategy of the
      MS.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-FR">
      Adaptive capacity of proposed (new) measures been considered. How/with
      which method and with which implications?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-FR">
      The (new) measures help in preserving the ecosystem services and
      socio-economic activities. Has the MS explained how the measures help in
      preserving the ecosystem services and socio-economic activities?
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Based on the existing information, the assessors should select:
  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if the MS presented information for all the questions in the
  summary box, &ldquo;Partially&rdquo; if the MS presented information for some
  of the questions in the summary box, &ldquo;No&rdquo; if the MS did not
  consider climate change when selecting measures, and &ldquo;No
  Information&rdquo; if no information on how climate change was considered
  exists.
