  Member States should explain If social and economic impacts of (new) measures
  have been considered and methods, including Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)
  and/or Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) are applied.

<p lang="en-US"><br /></p>
<p lang="fr-FR">
  Annex A of GD 10 (sections 2, 3 and 4) gives further guidance on the
  assessment of the environmental, socio-economic and transboundary impacts of
  new measures. More information on methods and how these have been applied is
  most likely available in the text-based studies produced by individual MS for
  supporting the development of the PoM at national level (limited information
  available at the descriptor level).
</p>
<p lang="fr-FR">
  Text-based accompanying reports to be screened include: the PoM itself;
  studies presenting methods and results for the technical feasibility
  assessment, the impact assessment (environmental, social and economic), CEA
  and CBA.

  To analyse the effectiveness of measures carried out, the assessor should
  consider the following aspects:
</p>
<ol type="A">
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p lang="fr-FR">
        whether the measures considered in the assessment are the measures
        required for addressing the main pressures/challenges faced;
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p lang="fr-FR">
        the types of assessments that have been carried out, including the
        relative role given to more quantitative/monetary assessments versus
        more qualitative approaches and in particular, the costs and benefits
        that have been considered in the assessments. (<em
          >In some cases, information might also be provided on how assessment
          results might have led to adaptations in the PoM/adaptations in the
          measures proposed)</em
        >
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p lang="fr-FR">
  Member states should specify if a CBA/CEA has been carried out, and for which
  measures (all measures, new measures only, or some new measures only). For
  this question, the assessors should look if the information reported is
  present for each measure fiche or at high level in the text report and the
  methodology applied to support the selection of new measures is well
  described.
</p>
<p lang="en-US"><br /></p>
<p lang="fr-FR">
  The assessor should then analyse the sufficiency of the information reported
  by considering the following aspects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Was the economic analysis carried out for all new measures required for
      addressing the main problems and challenges for all descriptors? If not:
      for which descriptors/measures/activities have the assessments been
      carried out? And what are the justifications for such narrowing down of
      the economic assessment?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Which categories of costs have been considered in the assessment (e.g.
      investment costs, mitigation costs, transaction cost (including monitoring
      and information cost), administrative cost, indirect costs) and whether
      these are assessed for all sectors or only for some?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Which categories of benefits have been assessed (e.g. direct and /or
      indirect benefits)? Have impacts on ecosystem services and on their
      beneficiaries been considered?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      How have costs and benefits been estimated? How have the estimated costs
      and benefits helped in a) consolidating, b) refining, and c) adapting the
      draft of the PoM?
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Based on the existing information, the assessors should select:
  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if all the related information exists and is well presented
  in the PoM and the measures fiche, &ldquo;Partially&rdquo; if only part of the
  information is presented (for some of the new measures), &ldquo;No&rdquo; if
  the information is not adequate, and &ldquo;No Information&rdquo; if the part
  on economic assessment was not presented by the MS.
