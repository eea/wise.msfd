  The updated Programme of Measures should contain a summary of the result of
  the gap analysis. A gap analysis assesses how far the updated existing
  measures together with the new measures adopted in the first cycle Programme
  of Measures are sufficient to reach MSFD environmental targets and achieve or
  maintain GES. Thus, the gap analysis must describe the need to modify the new
  measures from the first cycle or define additional measures to achieve the
  MSFD targets/MSFD GES descriptors.

  Only the text report is used to answer this question, ote that there are no
  specific requirements on the way the information about gaps to achieve
  targets/GES must be presented in the text report. MS might decide to include
  an entire chapter or annex called &lsquo;gap analysis&rsquo; or, more likely,
  the information on gaps can be scattered throughout the text, under different
  headings. Also, it depends on the term used in the national language and the
  English translation. Thus, to answer this question, a careful screening of the
  text report is needed.

  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Partially</strong>: there is some explanation on the methods used
      to select additional new measures, but gaps to address the pressures and
      to achieve GES are not presented; a gap analysis is provided in a general
      way (not specific for each descriptor); a gap analysis is provided only
      for some descriptors, not for others.

      <strong>No</strong>: there is no information on the gap analysis in the

    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify where this information is found in the text report: indicate
      whether the gap analysis is presented in the general overview of the text

  <li>

      Provide a summary of the gap analysis if it is presented in a general,
