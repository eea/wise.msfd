  The updated Programme of Measures should contain a summary of the result of
  the gap analysis. A gap analysis assesses how far the updated existing
  measures together with the new measures adopted in the first cycle Programme
  of Measures are sufficient to reach MSFD environmental targets and achieve or
  maintain GES. Thus, the gap analysis must describe the need to modify the new
  measures from the first cycle or define additional measures to achieve the
  MSFD targets/MSFD GES descriptors.

<p>
  Note that there are no specific requirements on the way the information about
  gaps to achieve targets/GES must be presented in the text report. MS might
  decide to include an entire chapter or annex called &lsquo;gap analysis&rsquo;
  or, more likely, the information on gaps can be scattered throughout the text,
  under different headings. Also, it depends on the term used in the national
  language and the English translation. Thus, to answer this question, a careful
  screening of the text report is needed.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify where this information is found in the text report: indicate
      whether the gap analysis is presented in the general overview of the text
      report or is specific for each descriptor.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Provide a summary of the gap analysis if it is presented in a general,
      cross-cutting way.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If the gap analysis provides in a general way, select the
  &lsquo;partially&rsquo; response option. If the gap analysis is specific for
  each descriptor, select &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
  If a gap analysis is not provided, the subsequent adequacy questions should be
  scored as &ldquo;Not relevant&rdquo;.
