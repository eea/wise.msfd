<p lang="fr-FR">Member state should provide information on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The evolution of coordination between MSFD and other EU directives (if
      any) is presented
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The evolution of coordination between MSFD and international agreements
      (if any) is presented
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The lack of evolution of the coordination between MSFD/other policies is
      justified
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p lang="fr-FR">
  The assessors should verify if a description on the evolution, since the first
  PoM, in the coordination between the MSFD and other EU legislation was
  provided by the MS.
</p>
<p lang="fr-FR">
  The assessors should verify if the information is clearly presented and
  consider the following aspects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Is the information on the evolution, since the first PoM, in the
      coordination between MSFD and other EU legislation is clearly presented?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">Is the information provided understandable?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      What are the key changes in coordination since the first PoM?
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For the responses option, the assessors should select &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if
  information exist on the evolution between MSFD and the three EU legislations
  (e.g. WFD, MSP, CFP), &rdquo;Partially&rdquo; if information on the evolution
  between MSFD and one or two EU legislations exists, &ldquo;No&rdquo; if the
  coordination between MSFD and other EU legislation did not evolve since the
  first PoM, and &ldquo;No Information&rdquo; if no information exists.
