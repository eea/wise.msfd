  Member states should describe how overall coordination with other EU
  legislation and policies (including international agreements) is done and how
  it impacted the update of the PoM.
</p>
<p lang="fr-FR">The assessors should verify if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The objectives of coordination between the MSFD and the other key relevant
      policies WFD, MSP, HBD and CFP are clearly presented.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The mechanisms set for the coordination between the MSFD and the other key
      relevant policies (WFD, MSP, HBD and CFP) are clearly presented.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      How MSFD-related measures are considered in the key relevant policies (WFD
      PoM, MSP documents, HBD and CFP).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      How WFD, MSP, HBD and CFP-related measures are considered in the MSFD PoM.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p lang="fr-FR">
  The assessor should assess if this information is available and consider the
  following aspects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-FR">
      Is the information provided understandable and clearly making references
      to specific standards/practices/norms that it links to other types of
      instruments?
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-FR">
      Is the information provided understandable and clearly making references
      to &ldquo;governance mechanisms&rdquo; that are established?
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For the response options, the reviewer should select: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if the
  information exists for the four policies; &ldquo;Partially&rdquo; if the
  information exists for one or two of the policies, and &ldquo;No&rdquo; if
  information on coordination with other key policies is not presented.
