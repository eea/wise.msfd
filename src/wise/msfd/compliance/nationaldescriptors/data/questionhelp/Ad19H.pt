<p><strong>Guidance:</strong></p>
<p>
  Member states should describe how (sub)regional coordination in reviewing and
  updating the PoM was undertaken, what are the changes since the first cycle
  and what are the key outcomes of regional coordination (e.g. coordinated
  national PoMs, joint measures, identification of issues for EU/international
  consideration (Article 5(2)).
</p>
<p>The assessor must check if:</p>
<p>
  &bull; The key mechanisms and outcomes of cooperation with RSC are clearly
  presented.
</p>
<p>
  &bull; There is a change in the mechanisms of cooperation between the
  different RSC.
</p>
<p>
  &bull; The administrations/institutions responsible in communicating the
  transboundary impacts to the neighbouring Member States are clearly
  mentioned/presented.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  For the response option, the assessors should select:&rdquo; Yes&rdquo; if all
  the information above were presented in the PoM, &ldquo;Partially&rdquo; if
  some of the information presented above are presented in the PoM, and
  &ldquo;No&rdquo; if no information on regional cooperation was presented.
