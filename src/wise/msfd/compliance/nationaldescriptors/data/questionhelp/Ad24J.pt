  Member states (MS) should present any relevant change in the implementation
  process and/or the administrative framework since the first cycle, and how
  this is likely to improve the quality and the likelihood of the implementation
  of the PoM. (e.g. the policy tools or plans containing the measures, including
  new measures, for protecting the marine environment, e.g. WFD PoM, national
  waste prevention plans) (Articles 13(3), 13(7) and 13(10)). In addition, the
  MS should provide a timeframe for implementation of new measures.
</p>
<p lang="fr-FR">The assessors should check if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The MS presents any relevant changes in the implementation process and/or
      the administrative framework since the first cycle.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The time frame for the implementation of the new measures is clearly
      presented for each measure.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For the response option, the assessors should select: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if the
  MS presents the changes in the implementation/administrative process since the
  first cycle and the time frame for the implementation of new measures is
  clearly presented, &ldquo;Partially&rdquo; if some changes are made since the
  first cycle and/or if the time frame for the implementation of new measures is
  presented for some of the new measures, &ldquo;No&rdquo; if no changes in the
  implementation process were presented, and &ldquo;No Information&rdquo; if no
  information was presented.
