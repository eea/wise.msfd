<p>
  The updated Programme of Measures should provide the list of additional new
  measures (short description), while more specific details on these measures
  should be provided in the form of factsheets as described in chapter 6 of GD10
  (e-reporting &lsquo;detailed information on new measures&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>
  There are specific schema fields to check in the e-reporting to answer this
  question.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      filter the relevant schema fields to see whether any additional new
      measure is defined in the second cycle PoM
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      list all additional new measures per descriptor (code and title).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  For the first pilot, the assessor must review the information provided in the
  text report and:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicate if the text report provides information on whether additional new
      measures are defined in the second cycle
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicate if such information is presented in the general overview or if it
      is specific for each descriptor
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify whether additional new measures are presented in a general way in
      the text or if there is a full detailed list (e.g. presented in a table).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Specify where this information is found in the text report.</p>
<p>
  If the gap analysis defined that there is no need, this question is &lsquo;not
  relevant&rsquo;.
