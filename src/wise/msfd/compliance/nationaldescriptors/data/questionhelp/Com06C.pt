<p>
  If gaps are identified between the set of updated existing measures and new
  measures reported in the first cycle and what is needed to reach the
  environmental targets and hence to achieve or maintain GES, the next step
  consists of updating the new measures from the first cycle or identifying
  possible additional new measures in the second cycle to meet the MSFD
  environmental targets.
</p>
<p>
  According to GD10, the updated Programme of Measures should provide the list
  of additional new measures (short description), while more specific details on
  these measures should be provided in the form of factsheets as described in
  chapter 6 of GD10 (e-reporting &lsquo;detailed information on new
  measures&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  Start by checking the e-reporting. There are specific schema fields to check
  in the e-reporting to answer this question (filter). If no information is
  found in e-reporting, check the text report (measures fiches or factsheets).
  There may be cases where text reporting and e-reporting are not consistent.
