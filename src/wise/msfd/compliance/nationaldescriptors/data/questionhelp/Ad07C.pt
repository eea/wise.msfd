  The updated Programme of Measures should describe how the modified/additional
  new measures will be implemented (e.g. by legal, policy, socio-economic or
  financial instruments), and provide an overview of potentially co-financed
  measures (Article 22) where relevant.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  For this question, priority will be given to e-reporting as there are specific
  schema fields for each measure. If there is no information in the e-reporting,
  check the text report. Specify where this information is found in the text
  report.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The assessor must check whether:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Implementation mechanisms are reported for each measure. The following
      schema fields: &lsquo;PoliciesConventions&rsquo;, PolicyNational,
      ResponsibleCompetentAuthority, , CoordinationLevel,
      RegionalCooperation_countries. &lsquo;MeasureDescription&rsquo;;
      ResponsibleOrganisation are optional fields.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Financing for the measures is secured (&lsquo;Financing&rsquo; schema
      field)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicators are reported and clear; they adequately help measuring
      progress.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The measure description clearly explains the &lsquo;modes of
      actions&rsquo;
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The assessor must check these four aspects are reported for all relevant
  measures in the relevant schema fields and
  <strong
    >add their expert judgment to say whether they think these implementation
    mechanisms are sufficient.</strong
  >
  For instance, if all measures are implemented only through technical means, it
  might not be sufficient, some measures may require legislative interventions.
  It is also useful to understand the level of coordination between different
  authorities as we know that the lack of coordination between different
  ministries is one of the main reasons why many MSFD-related measures fail. The
  primary example of that is between fisheries and environment, but there are
  many other examples (e.g. maritime transport, agriculture, etc.).
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  A categorisation of the &lsquo;modes of action&rsquo; is provided in the
  guidance document (see GD 10, Annex A.3): technical, legislative, economic and
  policy-driven. The following categories were used for detailed reporting of
  new measures under Art. 13 MSFD under the first cycle:
</p>
<table width="935" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">
  <colgroup>
    <col width="919" />
  </colgroup>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="919">
        <p lang="en-US"><strong>N&deg; Mode of action</strong></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="919">
        <p lang="en-US">
          1 <strong>Technical:</strong> an actual action that one can see (and
          measure) in the field. In principle, a wide range of measures has a
          primarily technical mode of action.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="919">
        <p lang="en-US">
          2 <strong>Legislative:</strong> Adapting or supplementing national
          environmental law and other national legislation influencing the
          marine environment to implement environmental targets and to
          achieve/maintain GES.
        </p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="919">
        <p lang="en-US">
          3 <strong>Economic:</strong> such as economic incentives that provide
          financial motives to stimulate the desired behaviour or discourage
          unwanted behaviour. Financial instruments are often aimed at the
          uptake of technical measures.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="919">
        <p lang="en-US">
          4 <strong>Policy-driven:</strong> Policy instruments can be economic
          incentives, but also other instruments, such as voluntary agreements
          with stakeholders, communication strategies, awareness-raising, and
          education.
        </p>

<p>
  No specific schema field is included for the second cycle reporting, but these
  &lsquo;modes of action&rsquo; can be derived from the schema field
  &lsquo;MeasureDescription&rsquo;.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  In addition, GD18, p. 15-16 provides further guidance on what implementation
  status would mean for the different modes of action. This must be checked in
  the schema field &lsquo;ImplementationStatus&rsquo;.
