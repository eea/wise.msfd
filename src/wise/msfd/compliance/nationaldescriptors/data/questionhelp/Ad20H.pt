<p>
  The Member States should explain how the transboundary impacts of the updated
  PoM on waters beyond national marine waters have been identified and assessed
  (Article 13(8)).
</p>
<p>
  In the case of transboundary impacts of the updated PoM, it should explain how
  and when these transboundary impacts (positive and negative) have been
  notified to which affected states, and how their views were considered in the
  final PoM. Reference is made to the Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA)
  Directive and the SEA-Protocol of the Espoo Convention, which provides for
  transboundary consultation processes.
</p>
<p>
  The details of the update should clarify whether these procedures have been
  followed and if not, what alternative procedures were applied. More
  information on the use of the SEA Directive in the update of the Programme of
  Measures is provided in Annex A (section 5 of GD10).
</p>
<p>The assessors should check if:</p>
<p>
  &bull; The transboundary impacts of the updated PoM on waters beyond national
  marine waters have been identified and assessed.
</p>
<p>
  &bull; The transboundary impacts (positive and/or negative) have been notified
  to the neighbouring Member States and to which Member States.
</p>
<p>
  &bull; The views of the affected Member States were taken into account in the
  final PoM.
</p>
<p>
  &bull; The Member State identified Key Types of Measures (KTM) responsible for
  the transboundary impacts.
</p>
<p>
  &bull; The main descriptors, Good Environmental Status, and targets that will
  be impacted by PoM.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  For the response option, the assessors should select: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if all
  the information mentioned above is clearly presented, &ldquo;Partially&rdquo;
  if some of the information presented above is presented, and &ldquo;No&rdquo;
  if transboundary impacts were not assessed, and &ldquo;No Information&rdquo;
  if no information on transboundary impacts was presented.
