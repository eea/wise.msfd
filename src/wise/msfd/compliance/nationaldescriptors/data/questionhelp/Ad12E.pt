  Social impacts and issues have often been limited to unemployment
  considerations in the MSFD implementation. However, Member States (MS) have
  shown an increasing interest in investigating social implication for the
  implementation of the MSFD PoM. Hereafter, it is relevant to identify the
  attention given, by MS, to social issues while elaborating the second PoM, and
  to identify how these social issues helped MS in elaborating the PoM. Social
  impacts and issues might include <em>inter alia</em>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Impact on employment, be it for sectors targeted by measures or sectors
      benefiting from the implementation of the PoM.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Impact of measures on fragile social groups (affordability questions).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The distribution of costs and benefits among different sectors and social
      groups.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">Social acceptability of the measures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Better understanding of implications in the delivery of, and equitable
      access to, ecosystem services (and in particular cultural ecosystem
      services);
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Better understanding of the wellbeing improvement for individuals.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Better understanding of how the pressure put on the marine environment is
      distributed between the different sectors and households.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For this question, the assessors should look if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      A social assessment was carried out while elaborating the PoM.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      The results of social assessment are used for the selection of measures.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">The results impacted on adaptation of measures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">The social indicators/issues are well presented.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Based on the existing information, the assessors should select:
  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if the MS investigated specific social impacts and the
  results were reported in the PoM; &ldquo;Partially&rdquo; if the MS
  investigated social issues but did not report the results in the PoM;
  &ldquo;No&rdquo; if the MS did not investigate any social issues; and
  &ldquo;No information&rdquo; if no information was reported.
