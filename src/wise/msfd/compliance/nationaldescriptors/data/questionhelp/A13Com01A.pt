<p>
  The details of the update of the Programme of Measures should explain which
  environmental targets (Article 10) it addresses, e.g. those reported in 2018
  under Art. 17 in conjunction with Art. 10 MSFD, or any subsequent updates in
  the period leading up to the review and update of the PoM. The Member States
  should clarify in the POM (general overview of the text report) whether they
  have set any operational targets that relate to concrete implementation
  measures to support their achievement (MSFD Annex IV (2)).
</p>
<p>
  For this question, we only look at the text-based report to understand whether
  targets and their updates are well presented.
</p>
<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">Indicate if there is such information in the text report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicate if it is presented in the general overview or if it is specific
      for each descriptor
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify whether the targets are presented in a general way in the text or
      if there is a full detailed list of targets (e.g. presented in a table).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Specify whether the Member State presented new targets or updated targets
      in the PoM. <br />
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Member States must indicate the relevant target for each measure in the
  e-reporting (schema field &lsquo;relevantTarget&rsquo;). This will be assessed
  in the adequacy question Ad04C.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the MS might use different terminology to identify the targets, e.g.
  objectives, priorities etc. Some level of interpretation of the EN translation
  is needed here.
</p>
<p>
  Start by stating which response option you have selected and continue
  explaining why. This is applicable to all summary boxes. E.g. &lsquo;the MS
  has not provided an overview of the updated POM corresponding to environmental
  targets&rsquo; or &lsquo;The MS has provided a partial overview of the updated
  POM corresponding to environmental targets&rsquo; or &lsquo;It is not clear
  whether the MS has&hellip;&rsquo;.
