<p>
  If gaps are identified between the set of updated existing measures and new
  measures reported in the first cycle and what is needed to reach the
  environmental targets and hence to achieve or maintain GES, the next step
  consists of updating the new measures from the first cycle or identifying
  possible additional new measures in the second cycle to meet the MSFD
  environmental targets.
</p>
<p>
  The updated Programme of Measures should provide an overview of the new
  measures proposed in the updated Programme of Measures, specifying if new
  measures from the first cycle have been modified to better address a certain
  pressure.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  Start by checking the e-reporting. There are specific schema fields to check
  in the e-reporting to answer this question (filter). If no information is
  found in e-reporting, check the text report. There may be cases where text
  reporting and e-reporting are not consistent. The assessors can double check
  in the module what were the measures defined in the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle. This
  can be done directly in the module: select the tab &lsquo;2016 Report&rsquo;
  in the assessment page. E.g. for BE:
  <u
    ><a
      href="https://water.europa.eu/marine/assessment-module/national-descriptors-assessments/be/ans/d1.1/art13"
      >https://water.europa.eu/marine/assessment-module/national-descriptors-assessments/be/ans/d1.1/art13</a
    ></u
  >
</p>

  You can also checxk the measures reported by the MS in the first cycle in the
  file: &lsquo;MSFD_FULL_list_of_measures_first cycle_ALL_MS&rsquo; in the Teams
  channel:

<ul>
  <li>

      <strong>Yes:</strong> the MS has modified one or more new measures from
      the first cycle.

  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Partially:</strong> there are no new measures reported as modified
      in the e-report, but in the text report there is some information on
      modified new measures; the measures are reported but only a few of the
      schema fields required are complete (e.g. there is no measure code, no
      measure title).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>No</strong>: the MS has not modified any new measure from the

<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicate whether the MS reported any new measure (category 2 measures) as
      &lsquo;modified since 2015 POM&rsquo; in the e-report.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      List in the table below the category 2 measures reported as
      &lsquo;modified since 2015&rsquo;, clearly stating to which descriptor
      they are relevant (fill table below). The descriptor is reported under the
      schema field &lsquo;GESComponent&rsquo;.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      Indicate if information about modifications to new measures from the first
