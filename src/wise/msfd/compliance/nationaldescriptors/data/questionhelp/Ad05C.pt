  This question assesses the consistency of the reporting across Article 13 (the
  measures) and Article 10 (the targets), which is itself linked to Article
  9(GES determination).
</p>
<p>
  The assessors should check whether the targets reported under Article 13
  correspond to the targets reported under Article 10. Only the targets that
  were considered operational during Article 12 assessments should be considered
  (positive score (<em>adequate or partially adequate</em> to question
  <em
    >A10Ad1 &ndash; Do the targets address the achievement of GES by focusing on
    reducing relevant pressures and impacts?).
  </em>
  The list of targets reported under Article 10 and their assessment can be
  consulted directly in the module.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If new targets are reported, these must be listed in the summary box and will
  be taken into account throughout this assessment exercise.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  NOTE: The link between the measures and the targets might be provided only in
  the e-reporting and by using the codes provided under Art 10 without a
  description/title of the target. In case new targets appear or different codes
  are used, the assessment team may not be able to connect these targets with
  the ones reported in 2018.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The assessor must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check whether the targets reported in the PoM correspond to those reported
      under Art. 10
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      List the targets that were considered adequate or partially adequate under
      Art. 12 assessments - not only the code but also their title
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Specify whether all measures are clearly linked to one or more targets and
      highlight gaps/weaknesses if any (e.g. that the measures are linked to
      targets that were considered not operational)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Select &lsquo;yes&rsquo; if all the relevant measures schema fields are linked
  to relevant operational targets, &lsquo;partially&rsquo; if this is true only
  for part of the relevant measures, &lsquo;not clear&rsquo; if the information
  reported is not clear and inconsistent, &lsquo;no&rsquo; if none of the
  relevant measures are linked to operational targets.
</p>
<p>
  Select &lsquo;not relevant&rsquo; if there are no modified and additional new
  measures.
</p>

<p>
  For this question, priority will be given to e-reporting as there are specific
  schema fields for each measure. If there is no information in the e-reporting,
  check the text report. Specify where this information is found in the text
  report.
