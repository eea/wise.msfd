<p>
  This question assesses the consistency of the reporting across Article 13 (the
  measures) and Article 10 (the targets), which is itself linked to Article
  9(GES determination).
</p>
<p>
  The assessors should check whether the targets reported under Article 13
  correspond to the targets reported under Article 10.
  <u
    >Only the targets that were considered operational in Article 12 assessments
    should be considered</u
  >
  (positive score (green or orange color code to question
  <em
    >A10Ad1 &ndash; Do the targets address the achievement of GES by focusing on
    reducing relevant pressures and impacts?).</em
  >
  The list of targets reported under Article 10 and their assessment should be
  consulted directly in the module.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  If new targets are reported, these must be listed in the summary box and will
  be taken into account throughout this assessment exercise.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  For this question, priority will be given to e-reporting as there are specific
  schema fields for each measure. If there is no information in the e-reporting,
  check the text report. Specify where this information is found in the text
  report.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: The link between the measures and the targets might be provided only in
  the e-reporting and by using the codes provided under Art 10 without a
  description/title of the target. In case new targets appear or different codes
  are used, the assessment team may not be able to connect these targets with
  the ones reported in 2018.

<p><strong>Use of response options:</strong></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Yes&nbsp;:</strong> all the relevant modified and additional new
      measures are linked to relevant operational targets and as such contribute
      to meet the operational environmental targets and ultimately GES.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Partially:</strong> some of the relevant modified and additional
      new measures are linked to relevant operational targets and as such
      contribute to meet the operational environmental targets and ultimately
      GES.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not clear: </strong>there is not enough information to understand
      if the measures are linked to operational targets; the information
      reported is not clear and inconsistent
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>No</strong>: none of the modified/additional new measures is
      linked to operational targets.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="fr-BE">
      <strong>Not relevant</strong>: there are no modified/additional new
      measures.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Structure of the summary box:</strong></p>
<p>
  Start by stating which response option you have selected and continue
  explaining why.
</p>
<p>
  <br />
  The assessor must:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Check whether the targets reported in the PoM correspond to those reported
      under Art. 10
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      List the targets that were considered adequate or partially adequate under
      Art. 12 assessments - not only the code but also their title
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Specify whether all modified/additional new measures are clearly linked to
      one or more targets and highlight gaps/weaknesses if any (e.g. that the
      measures are linked to targets that were considered not operational)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
