# D2C1 — Primary: The number of non-indigenous species which are newly introduced via human activity into the wild, per assessment period (6 years), measured from the reference year as reported for the initial assessment under Article 8(1) of Directive 2008/56/EC, is minimised and where possible reduced to zero. Member States shall establish the threshold value for the number of new introductions of non-indigenous species, through regional or subregional cooperation.
# D2C2 — Secondary: Established non-indigenous species, particularly invasive non-indigenous species, which include relevant species on the list of invasive alien species of Union concern adopted in accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 and species which are relevant for use under criterion D2C3.
# D2C3 — Secondary: Proportion of the species group or spatial extent of the broad habitat type which is adversely altered due to non-indigenous species, particularly invasive non-indigenous species. Member States shall establish the threshold values for the adverse alteration to species groups and broad habitat types due to non-indigenous species, through regional or subregional cooperation.
#
# Scale of assessment: Subdivisions of the region or subregion, divided where needed by national boundaries.  Use of criteria: The extent to which good environmental status has been achieved shall be expressed for each area assessed as follows: — the number of non-indigenous species newly introduced via human activity, in the 6-year assessment period and a list of those species.
# Scale of assessment: As used for assessment of the corresponding species groups or broad habitat types under Descriptors 1 and 6.  Use of criteria: Criterion D2C2 (quantification of non-indigenous species) shall be expressed per species assessed and shall contribute to the assessment of criterion D2C3 (adverse effects of non-indigenous species).  Criterion D2C3 shall provide the proportion per species group and extent per broad habitat type assessed which is adversely altered, and thus contribute to their assessments under Descriptors 1 and 6.
