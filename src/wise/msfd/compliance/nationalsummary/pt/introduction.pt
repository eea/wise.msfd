  <h4>Requirements of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive</h4>
  <!--<div tal:content="structure view/information_memberstate"></div>-->
  <div>
The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, Directive 2008/56/EC) requires in Article 17 that Member States review, in a coordinated manner as referred to in Article 5, the following elements of their marine strategies every six years after their initial establishment:
    <ul>
      <li>(a) the initial assessment and the determination of good environmental status (GES), as provided for in Articles 8(1) and 9(1);</li>
      <li>(b) the environmental targets established pursuant to Article 10(1);</li>
      <li>(c) the monitoring programmes established pursuant to Article 11(1);</li>
      <li>(d) the programmes of measures established pursuant to Article 13(2).</li>
    </ul>
Details of any updates made following these reviews are to be sent to the Commission, to the Regional Sea Conventions and to any other Members States concerned.
MSFD Article 12 requires the Commission to assess whether the reports notified by the Member States constitute an appropriate framework to meet the requirements of the Directive. In drawing up these assessments, the Commission shall consider the coherence of frameworks within the marine regions or subregions and across the Community. The Commission is required to inform the Member States concerned whether, in its opinion, the reports notified are consistent with the Directive and to provide guidance on any modifications it considers necessary.
For Articles 8, 9 and 10, first reported in 2012, the first 6-year updates were due to be sent to the Commission by 15 October 2018.
This report provides a technical assessment of the Member State’s 2018 updates for Articles 8, 9 and 10, in support of the Commission’s obligations under MSFD Article 12

  <h4>Reports submitted by the Member State</h4>
  <div>
    The table gives details of when the Member State submitted its reports, in text (usually pdf) and electronic (xml) format. Electronic reporting was undertaken in relation to specific geographic areas (Marine Reporting Units) which are specified in an xml file (4geo.xml) and accompanied by geographic information system (GIS) shapefiles that allow the reported information to be displayed as maps. In cases where the Member State uploaded reports in stages (text reports) or modified previous versions (e-reports), multiple dates are shown. The final column indicates the difference (in days) between the date reported and the date when the reports were due according to the MSFD (value is positive if reported before the due date and negative if reported after the due date).
