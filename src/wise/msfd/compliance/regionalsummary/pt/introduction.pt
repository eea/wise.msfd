  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <h4>Requirements of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, Directive 2008/56/EC)
       requires in Article 17 that Member States review, in a coordinated manner
       as referred to in Article 5, the following elements of their marine
       strategies every six years after their initial establishment:</p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
      <li>the initial assessment and the determination of good environmental
          status (GES), as provided for in Articles 8(1) and 9(1);</li>
      <li>the environmental targets established pursuant to Article 10(1);</li>
      <li>the monitoring programmes established pursuant to Article 11(1);</li>
      <li>the programmes of measures established pursuant to Article 13(2).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Details of any updates made following these reviews are to be sent to the
       Commission, to the Regional Sea Conventions and to any other Members
       States concerned.</p>

    <p>MSFD Article 12 requires the Commission to assess whether the reports
       notified by the Member States constitute an appropriate framework to meet
       the requirements of the Directive. In drawing up these assessments,
       the Commission shall consider the coherence of frameworks within the
       marine regions or subregions and across the Community. The Commission is
       required to inform the Member States concerned whether, in its opinion,
       the reports notified are consistent with the Directive and to provide
       guidance on any modifications it considers necessary.</p>

    <p>For Articles 8, 9 and 10, first reported in 2012, the first 6-year updates
      were due to be sent to the Commission by 15 October 2018.</p>

    <p>This report provides an assessment of coherence of the Member State’s 2018
      updates for Articles 8, 9 and 10, in support of the Commission’s obligations
      under MSFD Article 12.</p>

  <h4>Reports submitted by the Member States</h4>
  <p>
    The table gives details of when the Member States submitted their reports,
    in text (usually pdf) and electronic (xml) format. Electronic reporting was
    undertaken in relation to specific geographic areas (Marine Reporting Units)
    which are specified in an xml file (4geo.xml) and accompanied by geographic
    information system (GIS) shapefiles that allow the reported information to
    be displayed as maps. In cases where the Member State uploaded reports in
    stages (text reports) or modified previous versions (e-reports), multiple
    dates are shown.</p>
